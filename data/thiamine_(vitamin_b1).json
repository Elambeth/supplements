      "abstract": "AIM: The cervicovaginal microbiome is associated with progression and regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Chemical peeling, an investigational treatment that shows promise as a non-invasive treatment for CIN, exfoliates the human papillomavirus (HPV)-infected cervical epithelium; subsequent alterations to the cervicovaginal microbiome may be a key mechanism of its effect. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a retrospective paired-sample analysis, we investigated the cervicovaginal microbiota of 28 CIN patients, comparing pre- and post-treatment samples from the same individuals who achieved high-risk HPV clearance. We used 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to detect microbial markers in liquid-based cytology solution from cervical scrapings. Enrichment of Lactobacillus hominis was significantly observed after chemical peeling by differential abundance analysis. Alterations in cervicovaginal bacteria after chemical peeling predicted multiple biochemical changes such as increased selenocompound and thiamine metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Chemical peeling may modulate microbiota and bacteria-derived metabolites, thereby contributing to an additional therapeutic mechanism against CIN."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Epigenetic regulation plays a critical role in diabetes research, with N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification emerging as a key factor in disease progression. METTL14, an essential epigenetic regulator, may influence the effects of thiamine on intensive insulin therapy in diabetic patients. Methods: Blood samples from twenty diabetic patients were collected before and after intensive insulin therapy for MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis. Genes with m6A modifications and corresponding mRNAs were identified and functionally analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis. RT-qPCR was used to confirm the overexpression of METTL14, PIK3R1, TPK1, and IPMK, while METTL14 overexpression was further validated in THP1 cells. Results: GO analysis revealed a significant enrichment of overlapping genes in metabolic pathways. A reduction in m6A modification levels was observed post intensive insulin therapy, indicating METTL14's involvement in regulating TPK1, IPMK, and PIK3R1 expression. TPK1 levels showed a positive correlation with thiamine levels. Clinical validation demonstrated that combining thiamine with insulin therapy significantly reduced glucose and triglyceride levels compared to insulin alone. Conclusions: Thiamine supplementation alongside intensive insulin therapy offers therapeutic potential by downregulating TPK1 expression and mitigating lipid-related complications in diabetic patients. These findings highlight the pivotal role of METTL14-mediated m6A modification in regulating key metabolic genes during diabetes treatment."

      "abstract": "Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced enteropathy is a clinically undesirable but highly prevalent problem. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) has a role in reducing oxidative stress as well as acting as a coenzyme in enzymatic reactions. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of TPP on the damage caused by indomethacin (IND), one of the NSAID group drugs, in the small intestine. In the experiment in which 32 rats were used, four groups were formed randomly (groups 1, 2, 3, 4; control, TPP, IND, IND + TPP group, respectively). Small intestinal injury was induced in group 3 and group 4 rats that were fasted 1 day beforehand by a single intragastric administration of 25 mg/kg IND. Half an hour before the model was created, 20 mg/kg TPP was administered to group 2 and group 4 by intragastric as pretreatment. Tissue changes, proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress status, macroscopic appearance, and histopathologic analysis were evaluated. All data were statistically analyzed, and significance was determined (p < 0.05). Prophylactic treatment with TPP resulted in maintenance of antioxidant enzymes (GPX, SOD) and GSH levels in small intestinal tissue analysis. However, the excessive increase in IND-induced lipid peroxidation (MDA) and total oxidant level (TOS) was not downregulated by TPP compared to group 3. Additionally, the treatment had no prophylactic effect on the reduction of proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6) levels in tissue. Histopathologic examination of the tissue revealed that IND disrupted the intestinal villus structure, causing erosive ulceration, degeneration, and inflammation. TPP reduced the inflamed areas and total tissue damage score in the IND group (p < 0.001). In this study, the positive effects of TPP use on some parameters in a short period of time suggested that TPP may produce more significant results with changes in the time and dose of use. Indeed, these beneficial effects obtained with a single dose suggest that TPP may provide protection in small intestinal enteropathy as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent."

      "abstract": "Bariatric surgery is a recognised intervention for severe obesity, a global epidemic associated with numerous comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Procedures such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass facilitate significant weight loss, improving metabolic health and quality of life. However, these surgeries carry hidden costs, particularly concerning nutritional deficiencies that are often overlooked in preoperative assessments. This case report presents a 27-year-old patient who, after undergoing gastric sleeve surgery, developed neurological symptoms due to thiamine deficiency. Thiamine, essential for energy metabolism, is crucial for neurological function, and its deficiency can lead to serious conditions like Wernicke's encephalopathy and polyneuropathy. Despite the initial success of the surgery, the patient faced significant morbidity due to this oversight. The report emphasises the need for rigorous nutritional monitoring and proactive supplementation post-surgery. It advocates for comprehensive preoperative counselling that addresses potential deficiencies and their long-term implications. By recognising these hidden costs, healthcare providers can better prepare patients for effective long-term management, enhancing post-operative outcomes and improving the overall quality of life for those battling severe obesity."

      "abstract": "Background: Oxidative stress and systemic inflammation during cardiac surgery can lead to postoperative complications. Although vitamin C and thiamine (vitamin B1) have individually demonstrated protective effects, their combined effects remain underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of combined vitamin C and B1 therapy versus that of vitamin C alone in reducing inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers and improving postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods: In this prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 64 patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery at a tertiary care center were randomized to receive either 1000 mg vitamin C or a combination of 1000 mg vitamin C and 100 mg vitamin B1 at four perioperative time points. Primary outcomes included changes in inflammatory biomarkers [C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and white blood cells], and cardiac biomarkers [creatine kinase-MB, Troponin-I, and lactate dehydrogenase]. Secondary outcomes included hemodynamic parameters and left ventricular function. Results: Compared with vitamin C alone, combined vitamin B1 and vitamin C significantly reduced postoperative cardiac biomarker levels. IL-6 levels were significantly lower immediately in the combined group; however, this effect was not sustained at 24 h post-surgery. Up to 24 h after surgery, no significant differences in hemodynamic stability or left ventricular ejection were observed between the groups. Notably, the combined therapy group demonstrated a lower incidence of postoperative arrhythmias and shorter dobutamine duration within 24 postoperatively. Conclusions: Combined vitamin C and B1 therapy significantly reduced markers of myocardial injury and early inflammatory responses (IL-6) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, suggesting its potential as a protective agent.",

      "abstract": "Research has highlighted numerous detrimental consequences of thiamine deficiency on digestive function. These range from impaired gastric and intestinal motility to aberrant changes in pancreatic exocrine function, gastric acidity and disturbances in gut barrier integrity and inflammation. Thiamine and its pharmacological forms, as a primary or adjunctive therapy, have been shown to improve symptoms such as nausea, constipation, dysphagia and intestinal dysmotility, in both humans and animals. This review aims to explore molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic action of thiamine in gastrointestinal dysfunction. Our analysis demonstrates that thiamine insufficiency restricted to the gastrointestinal system, i.e., lacking well-known symptoms of dry and wet beriberi, may arise through (i) a disbalance between the nutrient influx and efflux in the gastrointestinal system due to increased demands of thiamine by the organism; (ii) direct exposure of the gastrointestinal system to oral drugs and gut microbiome, targeting thiamine-dependent metabolism in the gastrointestinal system in the first line; (iii) the involvement of thiamine in acetylcholine (ACh) signaling and cholinergic activity in the enteric nervous system and non-neuronal cells of the gut and pancreas, employing both the coenzyme and non-coenzyme actions of thiamine. The coenzyme action relies on the requirement of the thiamine coenzyme form - thiamine diphosphate - for the production of energy and acetylcholine (ACh). The non-coenzyme action involves participation of thiamine and/or derivatives, including thiamine triphosphate, in the regulation of ACh synaptic function, consistent with the early data on thiamine as a co-mediator of ACh in neuromuscular synapses, and in allosteric action on metabolic enzymes. By examining the available evidence with a focus on the gastrointestinal system, we deepen the understanding of thiamine's contribution to overall gastrointestinal health, highlighting important implications of thiamine-dependent mechanisms in functional gastrointestinal disorders."

      "abstract": "The treatment of several pediatric metabolic diseases involves vitamins supplementation. Among these, thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine and biotin can be prescribed and compounded as hard gelatin capsules. In compounding practice, a medication can be done extemporaneously, leading to a risk of error. However, a medication can also be done in advance, analytically controlled and stored. Such practice reduce the risk of error and decrease the cost, but also imposes the realization of stability studies to establish beyond-use-dates. Thiamine hydrochloride, riboflavin, pyridoxine hydrochloride, and biotin hard gelatin capsules chromatographic and microbiological methods were both validated and used to perform stability studies. Thiamine hydrochloride 50 mg hard gelatin capsules with microcrystalline cellulose and silica as excipients are stable for 6 months when stored at 25 °C/ 60% RH protected from light. Riboflavin 50 mg with microcrystalline cellulose, pyridoxine hydrochloride 50 mg with microcrystalline cellulose and biotin 40 mg with microcrystalline cellulose/silica are stable for one year when stored at 25 °C/ 60% RH protected from light. These results allow the compounding in advance of batches of 300 capsules controlled, stored, and quickly dispensed in case of an emergency, such decreasing the risk of error and/or iatrogenic event.",

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a pan-cancer analysis to investigate the role of SLC25A19 in cancer. To investigate the role of SLC25A19 in cancer, we obtained RNA-seq, survival, and clinicopathological data from 33 cancers in the TCGA database. We performed expression and survival analyses of SLC25A19 across these cancers. Additionally, we explored the diagnostic and prognostic value of SLC25A19 specifically in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To understand the potential role of SLC25A19 in the immune microenvironment of HCC, we also analyzed its expression in relation to immune checkpoint genes. Then we identified the drug most strongly correlated with SLC25A19 expression in HCC. Finally, PCR and Western-Blotting experiments were performed on HCC and its paracancer tissues to verify the expression of SLC25A19. Our analysis revealed that SLC25A19 is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is associated with poor prognosis. We also found that high expression of SLC25A19 in HCC is associated with high expression of immune checkpoint genes, suggesting a potential role for SLC25A19 in immunotherapy. Furthermore, we identified drugs that are most strongly correlated with SLC25A19 expression in HCC, which could inform treatment decisions for HCC patients. PCR results showed that the expression of SLC25A19 in HCC was significantly up-regulated in 6 pairs of HCC and adjacent normal tissues. Our study can provide a reference for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC.",

In this study, Trichoderma longibrachiatum was mixed separately with various supplements to promote its efficiency in controlling S. sclerotiorum in common beans. The results indicated that the filtrate of T. longibrachiatum blended with potassium tartrate was the most efficient inhibitor of the growth and sclerotia formation of the pathogen. The same mixture also caused enormous morphological deterioration to the mycelia and sclerotia as observed using scanning electron microscopy. The FTIR spectra showed remarkable changes in vibrations related to the functional groups of all treatments. SDS-PAGE fingerprints and SCoT markers were used to determine the differences between treatments. In the greenhouse experiment, the rate of surviving plants in the treatment of T. longibrachiatum combined with potassium tartrate, thiamine, niacin, and a mixture of micronutrients was much higher than in the control groups after 30 days. The treatment of T. longibrachiatum mixed with potassium tartrate resulted in the highest levels of total phenolics, polyphenoloxidase activity, and peroxidase activity in the leaves of common beans. Furthermore, the same treatment displayed a higher number of surviving common bean plants under field conditions after 30, 45, and 60 days in soil naturally infested with the pathogen while also improving plant growth parameters. This study provides valuable insights into the effective biocontrol of S. sclerotiorum using T. longibrachiatum, in combination with various supplements, and highlights the potential for successful application of this strategy in common beans."

      "abstract": "The isolation, structural elucidation, and synthesis of pure thiamin were achieved in 1936, marking a milestone in vitamin research. As an organic compound soluble in water, thiamin is essential for carbohydrate metabolism in plants and animals, and in its active form-as part of the thiamin pyrophosphate coenzyme-performs these functions. Thereby, thiamin represents an essential vitamin to human health and is involved in several pathways that regulate several pathophysiological mechanisms. Cardiovascular disease is significantly impacted by thiamine imbalance and its supplementation offers substantial improvements to the associated conditions. In this comprehensive review, we aimed to examine the dual role of thiamine deficiency and accumulation, focusing on an analysis of the causes of thiamine deficiency. We detailed the effects of thiamine deficiency on metabolism and on cardiovascular risk and heart failure, explaining the molecular mechanisms involved in metabolic dysfunction, and highlighting the role of B1 vitamin supplementation in diabetes mellitus management and atherosclerosis development and progression. Indeed, B1 supplementation counteracts oxidative stress and inflammation, significantly ameliorating glycemic and lipemic profiles. Additionally, we reported the beneficial effects of thiamine in counteracting cardiotoxicity induced by cancer therapy. Although preclinical data strongly support the benefits of thiamine, clinical trial findings are in contrast and contradictory, hampered by limitations such as small sample sizes and inadequate follow-up. Further research is needed to investigate thiamine's potential benefits, overcoming current study limitations and evaluating its use as a supplemental therapy alongside standard treatments in different high-cardiovascular-risk conditions.",

We examined four large haplotypes (H1-4) in this gene, identified lead SNPs for the minor variants (MV), and explored potential transcription factor binding sites. We found that in T2DM patients, H3-MV correlated significantly with impaired glucose metabolism (pHOMA = 0.0189, pHbA1c% = 0.0102), while H4-MV correlated with altered uric acid (p = 0.0008) and white blood cell levels (p = 0.0272). In AU patients, H3-MV correlated with increased basophil granulocyte levels (p = 0.0273). In model cell lines, H3-MV presence increased gene expression (p = 0.0351), influencing responses to thiamine depletion and metformin (p = 0.0016). Although H4-MV did not directly affect luciferase expression, thiamine and fedratinib co-treatment significantly enhanced gene expression in thiamine-depleted cells (p = 0.04854). Our results suggest a connection between selected SLC19A3 variants and the severity of metabolic diseases or their response to treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Altered mental status (AMS) is a common cause of hospitalization among older adults, with a wide range of potential etiologies. However, the diagnostic and therapeutic yield of routine laboratory testing in such patients is unknown. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort of inpatient hospital admissions to a large academic medical center from 2017 to 2022 of patients 65 years and older for whom the admitting diagnosis was AMS, we assessed laboratory testing for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), syphilis, vitamin B12, folate, vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, niacin, and thiamine. We calculated the frequency of testing, rate of abnormal results, and rate of follow-up treatment. RESULTS: Of the 3169 patients, 2312 (73 %) received at least one designated lab, and overall, 12 % of labs were abnormal. Labs varied in frequency of use (0.2 % for niacin-66 % for TSH) and rate of abnormality (0 % for niacin-71 % for zinc). 16 % of abnormal index labs led to a new prescription at discharge. The most common tests - TSH, folate, and B12- were of relatively low diagnostic and therapeutic utility. Tests that were less common-zinc, vitamin D, and vitamin C-were more commonly abnormal. 3.8 % of patients tested for syphilis had abnormal results, and 72 % of patients with an abnormal result received treatment with penicillin during the index hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses suggest that commonly obtained labs in the workup of AMS have varied diagnostic and therapeutic utility. The contribution of observed laboratory abnormalities to a patients' AMS warrants further study to improve the delivery of high-value care."

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a chronic disorder of the nervous system caused by abnormal discharges from brain cells. Structural, infectious, metabolic, immunologic, and unknown causes can contribute to the development of seizures. In recent years, there has been increasing attention on epilepsy caused by genetic metabolic disorders. More than two hundred inherited metabolic disorders have been identified as potential cause of seizures, and they are mainly associated with energy deficiency in the brain, accumulation of toxic substances, abnormal neurotransmitter transmission, and deficiency of cofactors. Vitamins play a crucial role as components of several enzymes or coenzymes. Impaired metabolism of thiamine, biotin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folic acid can contribute to early-onset seizures and developmental abnormalities in infants. However, timely supplementation therapy can significantly improve patient prognosis of affected patients. Therefore, a thorough understanding and investigation of the metabolic basis of epilepsy is essential for the development of precise therapeutic approaches, which could provide significant therapeutic benefits for patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Systemic ischemic-reperfusion injury following cardiac arrest results in multisystem organ failure, brain injury and death. The aim of this trial is to investigate whether the combined use of cortisol, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and thiamine during the early post-resuscitation period reduces the neurologic injury among out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors treated with targeted temperature management (TTM). METHOD: This is a single-blind, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to be conducted in nine tertiary university-affiliated hospitals in South Korea. A total of 160 OHCA survivors treated with TTM will be randomly assigned to the treatment or control groups (1:1 ratio). For the treatment group, patients will intravenously receive a combination dose of ascorbic acid (50 mg/kg, maximum single dose 3 g), thiamine (200 mg), and cortisol (100 mg) that will be mixed in three separate 50mL bags of 0.9% saline, respectively, every 12 hours for 3 days. For the placebo group, patients will receive three separate 50mL bags of 0.9% saline intravenously in the same manner. The primary outcome is the peak neuron-specific enolase level at 48-72 hours after the return of spontaneous circulation. DISCUSSION: The potential benefits of ascorbic acid, thiamine, and cortisol as neuroprotective agents have been reported in previous preclinical trials. This trial is the first clinical trial to assess the neuroprotective effectiveness of a combination of ascorbic acid, thiamine, and cortisol for OHCA survivors.

      "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a prevalent condition characterized by damage to peripheral nerves, often linked to risk factors such as diabetes. This condition results from various forms of neural damage, including injury to the cell body, axons, or demyelination, frequently beginning with small and thinly or unmyelinated fibers. Such nerve damage disrupts normal signaling, leading to symptoms like numbness, tingling, and pain. Effective nerve repair and regeneration, particularly through remyelination, are essential therapeutic objectives. While vitamin B12's role in repair processes has been well established, emerging evidence suggests that other neurotropic vitamins, specifically B1 and B6, also contribute significantly to nerve health and symptom relief in PN. In this study, we demonstrate that a combination treatment of vitamins B1, B6, and B12 enhances repair and oxidative stress responses in co-cultures of neural and Schwann cells, leading to improved cell maturation and connectivity compared to vitamin B12 alone. Furthermore, proteomic analysis supports these observations at the molecular level, with enhanced cellular recycling processes like proteasome enhancement, as well as protein synthesis upregulation, needed to rebuild nerve connections and combatting oxidative stress. Our combined morphological and molecular results highlight the potential therapeutic advantage of the B1, B6, and B12 combination over vitamin B12 alone.",

Chronic alcohol consumption and vitamin B-complex deficiencies are contributing factors. Acute cases may present with a range of neurological symptoms, including seizures and coma. Subacute and chronic forms can lead to interhemispheric disconnection syndrome and progressive dementia. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a young male patient's first hospital admission due to an acute decline in conscious level. A detailed history revealed regular alcohol consumption and substandard living conditions. The deterioration in consciousness was attributed to the diagnosis of MBD based on neurological signs, characteristic brain imaging findings, and a history of alcohol use. In addition, a small bowel perforation was also diagnosed. Supportive therapy and thiamine were initiated, and the patient was transferred to surgery for an operation. After two surgeries, the perforation was covered. The patient's level of consciousness showed slight improvement; however, the psychiatrist noted severe cognitive deficits. Ultimately, the patient entered a septic state and passed away. CONCLUSION: Acute MBD can potentially cause altered mental state, coma, and death; however, cases can be complicated by other emergency conditions. This case demonstrates the importance of a multidisciplinary approach."

The clinical presentation exhibits a diverse range of manifestations. In this review, we explore reported cases in the literature and present two cases representing the extremes of the clinical spectrum: recurrent ataxia and Leigh syndrome. The former phenotype follows a milder course. The second one is characterized by early onset and severe symptoms, including dystonia, epilepsy, and developmental regression, progressing rapidly to severe disability with high mortality. Typically, children exposed to infectious or traumatic triggers display episodes marked by ataxia and dystonia, with periods of good health or only mild disabilities in between. Treatment with the phosphorylated thiamine active bioform, TPP, is more effective in the recurrent ataxia form, especially when initiated promptly at symptom onset. Further studies are needed to identify available biomarkers and establish correlations between different variants, severity, and treatment response.",

We studied the incidence and clinical impact of Warburg-driven lactic acidosis in lymphoma. METHODS: Patients admitted with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory lymphoma and documented lactate levels during the first week of admission were included. Patients with lactatemia were classified as secondary (with a recognizable cause for elevated lactate) or none (WE group). RESULTS: WE and secondary lactatemia were documented in 58 and 44 patients (15% and 12% of evaluable patients, respectively). Both WE and secondary lactatemia were associated with poor short-term survival. WE at presentation correlated with tumor burden, with most patients having aggressive disease, advanced stage, and extranodal involvement. WE was associated with high rates of early death (26% and 43% at 30- and 60-days, respectively). Higher lactate levels correlated with worse survival. Earlier initiation of chemotherapy was associated with a (nonsignificant) trend toward better outcomes, whereas steroid and/or thiamine therapy did not alter patient outcomes. Glucose administration was associated with worse survival. CONCLUSION: WE-driven lactatemia is associated with high tumor burden and increased short-term mortality in lymphoma.

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Lactic acidosis is one of the most common causes of metabolic acidosis in hospitalized patients. It happens when lactic acid production exceeds lactic acid clearance. The elevation of lactate was commonly improved after the restoration of tissue perfusion. However, there are rare cases of severe lactate elevation (greater than 8 mmol/L) in the intraoperative period of thoracoscopic surgery. A poor prognosis with high morbidity and mortality characterizes these cases. Case Description: A 72-year-old man was admitted to the Soroka University Medical Center for thoracoscopic robotic left upper lobe lobectomy due to squamous cell carcinoma. At the end of surgery (overall, 8.5 h), the lactate level reached 10.2 mmol/L with the development of severe lactic metabolic acidosis. Thiamine was successfully given to patients to stimulate lactate clearance towards the cycle of tricarboxylic acids via pyruvate. Conclusions: Though the pathogenesis of this state in our case is not fully clear, it may have been induced by chemotherapy and during tumor manipulation by a surgeon. The successful recovery of blood lactic levels after thiamine treatment is suggestive of thiamine deficiency as a possible cause of lactic acidosis in our patient. Although we do not have data on the plasma thiamine level, we suggest that its determination in the perioperative period would be beneficial for excluding a probable thiamine deficiency in the case of severe lactic acidosis."

      "abstract": "Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) is the leading cause of secondary osteoporosis. Recently, the \"bone-gut axis\" theory has linked bone development with gut microbial diversity, community composition, and metabolites. Curcumin, a well-studied polyphenol, shows potential in mitigating bone loss and osteoporosis. Alendronate, a standard therapeutic agent for osteoporosis, serves as a positive control in this investigation. The study demonstrates the potency of curcumin in reducing bone loss and restoring bone mineral density, enhancing trabecular parameters notably through increased trabecular number, volume, and thickness and reduced bone marrow cavity size. Gut microbiome sequencing revealed that both curcumin and alendronate treatments similarly enhanced gut microbial diversity and altered microbiota composition, increasing beneficial bacteria (Akkermansia_muciniphila, Dubosiella_sp910585105, and Ruminococcus_sp910584195) while reducing harmful bacteria (Treponema_D_sp910584475 and Duncaniella_sp910584825). Furthermore, significant changes in serum levels of metabolites including raffinose, ursolic acid, spermidine, inosine, hypoxanthine, thiamine, and pantothenic acid were observed post-treatment with curcumin or alendronate. Importantly, these beneficial metabolites and microorganisms were negatively correlated with inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, curcumin holds promise for use against GIOP by modulating the gut microbiome and serum metabolome as well as reducing systemic inflammation.",

This study investigated the protective effects of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), melatonin, and Liv-52, which have previously been shown antioxidant activities, on pyrazinamide-induced hepatotoxicity. METHODS: 36 albino Wistar male rats were divided into randomized six groups; healthy (HG), pyrazinamide (PZG), ATP + pyrazinamide (APZG), TPP + pyrazinamide (TPZG), melatonin + pyrazinamide (MPZG) and Liv-52 + pyrazinamide (LPZG) groups. ATP 4 mg/kg and TPP 25 mg/kg were administered intraperitoneally (IP). Melatonin 10 mg/kg and Liv-52 20 mg/kg were given orally. One hour after administration of ATP, TPP, melatonin, and Liv-52, 250 mg/kg pyrazinamide was applied orally to all rats except HG group. The treatment was repeated (1 × 1) for 4 weeks. Then, blood samples were taken for determination of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities. Immediately after, the rats were euthanized with thiopental sodium (50 mg/kg, IP), and the livers were removed. The tissues were analyzed for malondialdehyde (MDA), total glutathione (tGSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) also hydropic degeneration, necrosis, and apoptosis (caspase 3) were examined.One-Way ANOVA was used in biochemical analyses and Tukey test was used as post-hoc. For histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used and Dunn's test as a post-hoc. RESULTS: Pyrazinamide increased MDA land decreased tGSH, SOD, and CAT levels in liver tissues (p < 0.001). It also increased serum ALT and AST activities and caused severe hydropic degeneration and necrosis in liver tissue (p < 0.001). ATP, TPP, melatonin, and Liv-52 significantly prevented the biochemical and histopathological changes induced by pyrazinamide (p < 0.05). On the other hand, Liv-52 was more successful than other potential protectors in protecting liver tissue from pyrazinamide damage (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ATP, TPP, melatonin, and Liv-52 can be used to protect liver tissue from pyrazinamide-induced hepatotoxicity in rats.",

We encountered a case of WE presenting with mental status changes, where cortical ribboning appeared as a significant MRI finding. A 77-year-old male had experienced slowness of movement for approximately one year and was diagnosed with multiple system atrophy (MSA). He had difficulty eating; thus, he preferred soft rice porridge. He developed acute mental status changes, and a brain MRI revealed prominent cortical ribboning in both frontal cortices along with subtle medial thalami. The patient received intravenous thiamine, leading to dramatic recovery of mental status, and subsequent MRI follow-up showed near-complete resolution of both cortical and thalamic lesions. Cortical ribboning, which played a key role in this patient, is recognized as an atypical MRI finding of thiamine deficiency and is suggested to be associated with altered mental status in WE. However, to the best of our knowledge, no literature clearly lists thiamine deficiency as a differential diagnosis for cortical ribboning in patients with mental status changes. Recognizing this key imaging finding is crucial in differentiating WE in patients with mental status changes. Preventing the potentially fatal outcome of WE is of paramount importance. Patients with dysphagia tend to prefer soft foods, which may result in reduced thiamine intake. Our experience reaffirms the importance of a well-balanced diet in MSA patients with dysphagia."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six mice were randomly divided into normal-fat diet group (NFD), high-fat diet group (HFD), high-fat diet plus semaglutide intervention group (HS). Collected mice serum, urine, kidney tissue samples, and detected urinary protein/creatinine, blood glucose, blood lipid, inflammation, oxidative stress and other related indicators. Different staining methods were used to analyze the pathological changes of mice's kidneys. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was used to analyze the total protein in the kidneys of mice. Finally, bioinformatics technology was used to analyze significantly different expressed proteins (DEPs). RESULTS: The mechanism of semaglutide protecting the kidneys were related to oxidative phosphorylation, PPAR signaling pathway, thiamine, butyric acid and tryptophan metabolism pathways. Moreover, semaglutide could significantly increase the expression of Man1a1 and Ntn4 in the kidneys of mice, while the high-expression of Man1a1 and Ntn4 in KIRC population had a better overall survival rate. CONCLUSION: Semaglutide could regulate the development of KIRC by up-adjusting the expression of Man1a1 and Ntn4."

      "abstract": "Water-soluble B vitamins, mainly obtained through dietary intake of fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy products, act as co-factors in various biochemical processes, including DNA synthesis, repair, methylation, and energy metabolism. These vitamins include B1 (Thiamine), B2 (Riboflavin), B3 (Niacin), B5 (Pantothenic Acid), B6 (Pyridoxine), B7 (Biotin), B9 (Folate), and B12 (Cobalamin). Recent studies have shown that besides their fundamental physiological roles, B vitamins influence oncogenic metabolic pathways, including glycolysis (Warburg effect), mitochondrial function, and nucleotide biosynthesis. Although deficiencies in these vitamins are associated with several complications, emerging evidence suggests that excessive intake of specific B vitamins may also contribute to cancer progression and interfere with therapy due to impaired metabolic and genetic functions. This review discusses the tumor-suppressive and tumor-progressive roles of B vitamins in cancer. It also explores the recent evidence on a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between B vitamin metabolism and cancer progression and underscores the need for further research to determine the optimal balance of B vitamin intake for cancer prevention and therapy.",

A total of 149 piglets born from 15 multiparous sows were evaluated. The sows were randomly divided into two groups, control and TPP, with treatments administered 24 and 12 h before the expected farrowing date. The duration of farrowing was recorded. Furthermore, for all newborns, the Apgar vitality scale, teat suckling, newborn weight and weight at weaning, piglet vitality based on behavior (at birth and at 24 h), and skin temperature (at birth and at 24 h) were evaluated. The results indicated that the sows treated with TPP presented a lower farrowing duration (p = 0.0060) and their piglets exhibited a higher percentage in the piglet vitality-based behavior score (>50%). In addition, the newborn piglets of TPP-treated sows, which exhibited higher scores in behavior parameters, also displayed higher scores (>80%) in the Apgar vitality scale (>8), suckled on the teat for longer periods of time, and had higher daily weight gain (p < 0.0001). Our findings suggest that administering TPP at the end of gestation may shorten labor while also increasing the vitality of newborns. Therefore, it could be considered that, in practice, the administration of this treatment could have an impact on the energy that sows need during the farrowing process for the initiation of uterine contractions and abdominal effort. Therefore, this treatment could have an impact on the productivity and well-being of sows with a history of dystocic farrowing, which can increase the incidence of endometritis, vulvar discharge, placental retention, or mastitis-metritis-agalactia syndrome-alterations that can result in the reduced growth of piglets and a higher mortality before weaning. Therefore, the application of this treatment could not only reduce the probability of sows presenting these problems but perhaps also increase the probability of their offspring surviving in the first days after birth."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research is to identify metabolic markers associated with successful treatment by evaluating the effect of mesenchymal stem cell transplantation (MSCT) on the metabolic profiles of patients with SLE. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from 20 patients with SLE before and after MSCT. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to distinguish pretreatment and post-treatment groups and pathway analysis for identifying involved metabolic pathways. Clinical variables were monitored with a median follow-up time of 180 days. Pearson correlation and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis were employed to associate metabolite changes with clinical outcomes and to predict treatment success. RESULTS: We detected 18 121 metabolites, with 1152 showing significant changes post-treatment, which could be clearly distinguished between pretreatment and post-treatment groups through PCA. Pathway analysis indicated involvement in riboflavin and thiamine metabolism. Clinical improvements were observed at a median follow-up time of 180 days after MSCT, including decreased SLE Disease Activity Index scores, urine protein/creatinine ratios, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates, along with increased levels of complement C3 and C4, haemoglobin, and platelets. Pearson correlation indicated that specific metabolite changes were associated with clinical improvements, particularly increases in thiamine monophosphate (TMP) and asiaticoside levels. ROC analysis identified TMP level changes as the most predictive of treatment success, with a 35% increase indicating a good response to MSCT. CONCLUSION: This study concludes that TMP is a potential biomarker that can predict the efficacy of MSCT in treating SLE, providing valuable insights for clinical practice and further research.",

Emerging evidence highlights the role of purinergic signalling in atherogenesis, particularly the P2Y6 receptor in macrophages [1]. Using RNA sequencing, proteomics, expression and functional validation in cells, mouse models and human materials, this study provides comprehensive mechanistic insights into how macrophage P2Y6 receptors contribute to foam cell formation and plaque development through the phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ)/store-operated Ca2+ entry/calreticulin/scavenger receptor A (SR-A) pathway. Furthermore, the study identifies thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) as a potent P2Y6 receptor antagonist, effectively inhibiting foam cell formation and reducing plaque burden in atherosclerotic mice, without inducing toxicity. These findings establish P2Y6 receptors as promising therapeutic targets in atherosclerosis and introduce TPP as a potential clinical candidate for intervention."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia syndrome (TRMA) is a rare genetic disease caused by mutations in the SLC19A2 gene that encodes thiamine transporter 1 (THTR-1). The common manifestations are diabetes, anaemia, and deafness. The pathogenic mechanism has not yet been clarified. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Rat pancreatic islet tumour cells INS.1 were used to construct cell lines stably overexpressing wild-type SLC19A2 and SLC19A2 (c.1409insT) mutants. The mRNA and protein expressions of THTR-1 and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-associated factors were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot methods, respectively. Flow cytometry and cell counting kit-8 were used to analyse the effects of SLC19A2 (c.1409insT) mutation on cell apoptosis and proliferation, respectively. 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), an ERS inhibitor, was administered to SLC19A2 (c.1409insT)-mutated INS.1 cells, and then the mRNA and protein expressions of ERS-related factors in cells were detected. RESULTS: Mutations in the SLC19A2 (c.1409insT) promote apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation, thereby upregulating the mRNA and protein levels of ERS-associated factors glucose-regulated protein 78, protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, C/EBP homologous protein, and activating transcription factor 4. 4-PBA could inhibit ERS caused by SLC19A2 (c.1409insT) mutations, downregulate mRNA and protein expression levels of GRP78, CHOP, and phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α, and protect pancreatic islet β-cells. CONCLUSION: THTR-1 deficiency triggers diabetes in TRMA patients through ERS, and 4-PBA protects pancreatic islet β-cells by inhibiting ERS, which provides new ideas and intervention targets for the prevention and treatment of TRMA and diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Ifosfamide (IFO) is a nitrogen derivative used at different doses, alone or in combination, in the treatment of various types of solid and hematologic cancers. It is a pro-drug activated by cytochrome P450 enzymatic system into ifosforamide mustard, the alkylating component that carries out the cytotoxic effect of the IFO. The most common toxicities of IFO are gastrointestinal, cutaneous, hematological, urological, and neurological. The neurotoxicity may occur in up to 30% of patients and can manifest with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations (lethargy, somnolence, confusion, hallucinations, irritability, excitement, disorientation, weakness, seizures, movement disorders, coma) and a variety of EEG abnormalities, and is known as IFO-induced encephalopathy (IIE). There is no definitive explanation of the mechanism underlying this phenomenon, even though metabolism of IFO, which leads to the formation of neurotoxic components, is probably at the basis of neurotoxicity according to many hypotheses. Consequently, the different factors involved in IFO metabolism (i.e., genetic polymorphism of CYP2B6, GSTM1, GSTP1, and GSTT1; concomitant administration of drugs that affect the cytochrome P450 enzyme system; drug formulation) could be responsible of IIE. IIE is usually reversible by interrupting the IFO infusion and starting intravenous hydration but in some cases further interventions are needed. The most used pharmacological treatment is methylene blue, whose efficacy both as a curative and a prophylactic treatment has been the object of many studies, with mixed results. Other interventions that showed efficacy are thiamine (tested also as a prophylactic drug), dexmedetomidine, and hemodialysis. Other pharmaceuticals have been tested in a preclinical setting showing some activity: trifluoperazine, morin, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), and alpha lipoic acid (ALA). The aim of this review is to gather the current knowledge about the mechanisms underlying the IIE and the current therapeutic approach and the future perspectives."

The primary etiology of thiamine deficiency is consumption of a diet deficient in thiamine. In the United States, the most common cause of thiamine deficiency is alcohol use disorder due to the poor dietary intake that is often associated with this diagnosis. Thiamine deficiency also develops at an increased frequency in patients who have had gastric bypass surgery. Other medical conditions less commonly associated with thiamine deficiency include hyperemesis gravidarum, diabetes, and malnutrition outside of alcohol use disorder. Prompt recognition of thiamine deficiency is important since it is readily treatable, and prompt treatment increases the likelihood of favorable clinical outcomes. On the other hand, delayed diagnosis and treatment of severe thiamine deficiency can lead to permanent neurological deficits or may even be fatal. Since clinicians often do not consider thiamine deficiency in patients without a history of alcohol use disorder, this diagnosis is often either delayed or missed altogether. This case series presents four patients with acute neuropathy due to thiamine deficiency (normal range >70-180 nmol/L) and with corresponding neurophysiological and electromyographical data. It highlights the need to consider thiamine deficiency in all patients with acute to subacute lower extremity weakness or numbness."

Studies that allowed corticosteroid use in both the intervention and control cohorts as part of a standard-of-care protocol were eligible for inclusion. DATA SYNTHESIS: Heterogeneity of data exists, marked by divergent quantifications for successful pharmacotherapy interventions. Whereas some data support changes in patient outcome scores or critical illness indices, others have failed to demonstrate any meaningful benefit to ICU length of stay, ventilator status, or mortality. CONCLUSION: Exploring the individual and synergistic effects of ascorbic acid and thiamine on key pathways implicated in sepsis pathophysiology has not yielded unequivocal evidence supporting their use without concomitant corticosteroids."

METHODS: This systematic review examines 88 pediatric WE cases reported over the past 30 years, encompassing diverse etiologies such as cancer (25 cases), gastrointestinal diseases (19), malnutrition (17), psychiatric disorders (13), obesity surgery (5), renal disease (4), COVID-19 (2), PICU complications (1), hyperemesis gravidarum (1), and a genetic mutation (1). RESULTS: Prodromal symptoms included nausea (60%) and vomiting (55%). In total, 37% of the patients received parenteral nutrition without thiamine before WE diagnosis, often progressing to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS). Key findings revealed the classic triad of WKS, eye movement disorders (80%), mental status changes (75%), and ataxia (63%), with MRI demonstrating high diagnostic sensitivity (85%). Treatment varied widely; higher parenteral thiamine doses correlated with faster recovery and better outcomes, while insufficient dosages led to adverse effects. Full remission was achieved in 61% of cases, with improved outcomes in more recent reports due to refined dosing protocols. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of early recognition of nausea and vomiting as predictors of pediatric WE and the critical need to incorporate thiamine in parenteral nutrition for children. Optimal dosing remains vital for recovery, particularly in severe cases."

      "abstract": "Successful tuberculosis therapy requires treatment with an unwieldy multidrug combination for several months. Thus, there is a growing need to identify novel genetic vulnerabilities that can be leveraged to develop new, more effective antitubercular drugs. Consequently, recent efforts to optimize tuberculosis (TB) therapy have exploited Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) chemical genetics to identify pathways influencing antibiotic efficacy, novel mechanisms of antibiotic action, and new targets for TB drug discovery. However, the influence of the complex host environment on these interactions remains largely unknown, leaving the therapeutic potential of the identified targets unclear. In this study, we leveraged a library of conditional mutants targeting 467 essential Mtb genes to characterize the chemical-genetic interactions (CGIs) with TB drugs directly in the mouse infection model. We found that these in vivo CGIs differ significantly from those identified in vitro. Both drug-specific and drug-agnostic effects were identified, and many were preserved during treatment with a multidrug combination, suggesting numerous strategies for enhancing therapy. This work also elucidated the complex effects of pyrazinamide (PZA), a drug that relies on aspects of the infection environment for efficacy. Specifically, our work supports the importance of coenzyme A synthesis- inhibition during infection, as well as the antagonistic effect of iron limitation on PZA activity. In addition, we found that inhibition of thiamine and purine synthesis increases PZA efficacy, suggesting additional therapeutically exploitable metabolic dependencies. Our findings present a map of the unique in vivo CGIs, characterizing the mechanism of PZA activity in vivo and identifying potential targets for TB drug development.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Biotin-thiamine responsive basal ganglia disease (BTBGD) is a rare autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder characterized by diverse and variable phenotypic features, which can make diagnosis challenging. However, prompt treatment with thiamine and biotin can effectively manage the condition. Diagnosis relies on the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in the SLC19A3 gene. This case report describes two novel variants of uncertain significance in the SLC19A3 gene, which may be correlated with the phenotypic manifestations of BTBGD. CASE PRESENTATION: Our case is a 7-month-old female infant who presented with a 3-week history of irritability, altered behavior, and refusal of newly introduced solid foods. Symptoms started with an upper respiratory tract infection, followed by lethargy, floppiness, and abnormal movements. The patient was admitted to the pediatric ward with a broad differential diagnosis. Extensive laboratory evaluations revealed lactic acidosis. MRI brain showed symmetric restricted diffusion affecting the bilateral basal ganglia, thalami, and cortical regions. Whole genome sequencing identified biallelic variants of the SLC19A3: a c.1364T>G p.Met455Arg missense variant in the maternal allele and a 2.3 kb deletion of intron 3 of the paternal allele. Both variants were identified as variants of uncertain significance. However, given the clinical picture, MRI brain findings, resolution of symptoms with empiric biotin and thiamine supplementation, and biallelic SLC19A3 variants of unknown significance, the patient most likely suffers from BTBGD. Patient continues to show sustained developmental progress on biotin and thiamine supplementation. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the fact that genetic testing remains a vital but improvable tool for the diagnosis of BTBGD. As of yet, genetic testing and diagnosis of BTBGD continues to be limited by the knowledge of which SLC19A3 variants are established to be pathogenic variants. Thus, further research is required to study other SCL19A3 variants of unknown significance to further improve genetic testing and diagnosis of BTBGD in the future."

      "abstract": "In order to improve the bioavailability of thiamine and solve the bottleneck problem of its poor stability. Controlled hydrothermal treatment technology had been constructed to achieve stable interactions between starch and thiamine (VB1) molecules, resulting in the preparation of starch-thiamine complexes. The formation mechanism, intermolecular interactions, and structural properties between starch and thiamine were investigated and their digestive and physicochemical properties were explored. FTIR, XRD, ROMAN, and NMR results showed thiamine could interact with starch molecules primarily in two ways. One way was that thiamine could be binded to the exterior of the starch helical cavity via hydrogen bond. The other way is that thiamine could enter the starch helical cavity to form V-type crystals through electrostatic adsorption action, where both interaction ways would exhibit thermal competitive effects. After in vitro gastrointestinal digestion simulation, it was found that following the interaction with thiamine, the content of slowly digestible starch and resistant starch in the starch had both increased. Thiamine could slowly release in the colon, successfully achieving its stable and sustained release, thereby extending its retention time in the human body. Overall, starch-thiamine complexes displayed digestion resistance, encapsulate and protect thiamine, and promote controlled release of thiamine, thereby prolonging its retention in vivo for the fermentation.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To explore the alterations in metabolites of wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) by conducting metabolomics in aqueous humor from patients with wAMD and to assess the potential effects of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) on these metabolites. METHODS: Metabolomic analysis was performed on the aqueous humor of 30 patients with wAMD receiving anti-VEGF treatments and 20 controls, via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The aqueous humor samples collected from untreated patients with wAMD were classified as the pre-wAMD group. Accordingly, the samples collected from patients with wAMD receiving one anti-VEGF treatment were designated as the post-wAMD group. Individuals were further classified into responders and nonresponders according to their reaction to the treatment. Principal component analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotation and enrichment analysis, were subsequently performed. Machine learning and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were used to further analyze potential vital metabolites. RESULTS: Among the 1001 metabolites verified in the aqueous humor, 306 compounds separated patients with pre-wAMD from the control group, whereas 68 metabolites differentiated patients with post-wAMD and patients with pre-wAMD. Enrichment in metabolic pathways was noted in ABC transporters, thiamine metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway and tyrosine metabolism, and so on. Machine learning and receiver operating characteristic curves analysis suggested that δ-valerolactam could not only distinguish between patients with wAMD and the control group, but also differentiate between patients with post-wAMD and patients with pre-wAMD. Changes in acylcarnitine were observed in anti-VEGF responders with wAMD. CONCLUSIONS: There were noticeable alterations in the aqueous humor of patients with wAMD involving many metabolites that are associated with ABC transporters, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway. It is possible that δ-valerolactam can be applied as a biomarker in wAMD.",

This article reports a paresthesia by anesthetic injection. A 44-year-old man reported moderate pain during chewing and exposure to cold. Upon clinical examination, extension of the tooth fracture line was in the mesiodistal region of the mandibular left second premolar crown and was detected with 16× magnification of microscope. The diagnosis was cracked tooth syndrome, and root canal treatment was indicated. After the first appointment the patient reported altered sensation on left side of mandible, numbness and electric shock sensation, and therefore was diagnosed with mental nerve paresthesia. Diclofenac sodium, thiamine, cyanocobalamin, and pyridoxine were prescribed for 7 days as part of the treatment, and then root canal and restorative treatments were completed. Patient was scheduled for follow-up appointments after 1, 3, 6, and 8 months. After the first month, the feeling of paresthesia was still present and the patient was experiencing a painful \"electric shock\".

      "abstract": "AUDIENCE: Emergency medicine residents and medical students on emergency medicine rotations. INTRODUCTION: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is common in the United States, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 30%.1 The rate of use is higher among white males, Native Americans, and individuals of low socioeconomic status.1 Alcohol withdrawal symptoms manifest in 50% of individuals who misuse alcohol.1 While life-threatening sequelae of alcohol withdrawal are rare, the syndrome is a common reason for emergency department (ED) presentations. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms range from benign, cravings, nausea, anxiety and tremulousness, to life-threatening autonomic dysfunction, seizures, coma, and death.2 The pathophysiology of this clinical syndrome involves dysregulation of central nervous system (CNS) receptor function. Alcohol acts as a CNS depressant through activation of the CNS Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. Chronic or heavy alcohol use results in downregulation of CNS inhibitory GABA receptors and upregulation of CNS excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors.2 Upon discontinuation of alcohol use, this imbalance results in CNS hyperexcitability, creating the clinical symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.2 Symptoms typically manifest within eight hours after alcohol cessation, reach their peak in one to three days, and can extend for up to two weeks.3 Mild symptoms include anxiety, tremors, diaphoresis, nausea and/or vomiting. Severe symptoms include hallucinations (typically 12-24 hours after last alcohol intake) in 2-8% of patients, seizures (12-48 hours after last intake) in up to 15% of patients, and delirium tremens.3 Delirium tremens is a potentially fatal encephalopathy in patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal and occurs in 3-5% of patients approximately 72 hours after last alcohol intake.3 Without recognition or prompt treatment, mortality from delirium tremens can be as high as 50%.4 Management of alcohol withdrawal requires prompt recognition and control of symptoms. Most often this is accomplished by administering benzodiazepines, though alternative medications such as barbiturates, ketamine, or propofol are also used. Severe withdrawal may progress to intubation and mechanical ventilation.5 Given the high prevalence of AUD in the United States and the potential for life-threatening withdrawal symptoms, ED practitioners must recognize the spectrum of this disease and be comfortable with managing an array of presentations. EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES: At the end of this oral boards session, learners will: 1) demonstrate the ability to perform a detailed history and physical examination in a patient presenting with signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, 2) investigate the broad differential diagnoses, including electrolyte abnormalities, trauma in the intoxicated patient, mild alcohol withdrawal, and delirium tremens, 3) list appropriate laboratory and imaging studies to include complete blood count (CBC), complete metabolic panel (CMP), magnesium level, computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain; 4) understand the management of hypoglycemia with concurrent administration of thiamine to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy and subsequent Korsakoff syndrome, 5) appropriately treat acute alcohol withdrawal with intravenous (IV) hydration and benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, or alternative medications, and 6) understanding the need for the complex management of these patients, appropriately disposition the patient to the intensive care unit after consulting with critical care specialists. EDUCATIONAL METHODS: The case was written as an oral boards case to test learners in a simulated oral board format. In this manner, learners could be evaluated on their critical thinking skills one-on-one with an instructor, outside of the distractions of the emergency department. Oral board simulation can test multiple modalities, including data collection, data synthesization and pharmacologic treatment in order to assess residents' overall clinical care and competence. Learners were assessed both by the instructor with immediate feedback, as well as by using Google forms to tie critical actions to Emergency Medicine Milestones. Results were compiled and used during clinical competency evaluations. RESEARCH METHODS: Learners (n=40) and examiners were given the option to provide written feedback after the case was completed to assess for strengths and weaknesses of the oral boards case, and subsequent changes were made to improve the administration of the case. RESULTS: Residents and medical students rated this highly and found this to be an enjoyable, yet still challenging, way to stay current on their management skills of alcohol withdrawal. Learners rated the session 4.6 out of 5 using a five-point Likert scale (5 being excellent) after the session was completed (n=25). DISCUSSION: We found this oral board case to be an effective educational tool for reviewing alcohol use disorder among students and residents. Using an oral board case allows junior and senior residents to be tested quickly in a low-stakes environment. Learners and instructors both felt the content was appropriate, and using the completed forms in competency meetings improved the committee's ability to assess residents on specific milestones. Though we initially wrote this case requiring the examinee to have advance knowledge of the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment Alcohol Scale Revised (CIWA-Ar), this was not deemed essential to emergency medicine residents or faculty, and it was removed. The current case formatting represents a more realistic case presentation and critical actions. TOPICS: Alcohol withdrawal, electrolyte abnormalities, seizures, altered mental status."

The typical triad of symptoms in Wernicke's encephalopathy includes impaired consciousness, ocular motility disturbances, and ataxic gait.

Here, we highlight the pupil diameter and light reflex abnormalities observed in this case. A 73-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of dizziness and then referred to our department four days later because of impaired consciousness. He presented with constricted pupils, diminished light reflexes, restricted eye movements, nystagmus, muscle weakness, and ataxia in the trunk and limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed lesions in the cerebellar vermis, brain stem, and bilateral medial thalamus, leading to a diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy. Following thiamine supplementation, his symptoms and magnetic resonance imaging findings improved. His pupil diameter and light reflexes, as assessed with a pupillometer, also improved over time. Tracking pupillary findings using the pupillometer may be useful in determining treatment efficacy in Wernicke's encephalopathy and is reported here."

This case report describes a patient developing WE postbariatric surgery, due to the use of over-the-counter transcutaneous multivitamin patch rather than recommended vitamin tablets. CASE REPORT: A 61-year-old female presented with 45 pounds of weight gain over the past year with a body mass index of 39.58 kg/m2. She underwent lifestyle modification and treatment with dulaglutide with limited success. After evaluation and counseling, the patient underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery and was prescribed thiamine, cholecalciferol, vitamin B12, and multivitamin tablets postoperatively. Eight months later, she presented to the emergency room with confusion, bilateral lower extremity weakness, paresthesia, and ataxia. Neurological examination revealed disorientation, nystagmus, and bilateral lateral rectus palsies. She reported using transcutaneous multivitamin patches instead of the recommended oral supplementation. The clinical features, low serum thiamine level of 1.28 μg/dL (reference 2.5-7.5 μg/dL), and resolution of symptoms following supplementation confirmed the diagnosis of WE. DISCUSSION: Obesity often predisposes individuals to multiple nutritional deficiencies. It is critical that these patients take adequate vitamin supplementation before and after bariatric surgery. Thiamine deficiency can present as WE due to inappropriate supplementation such as use of a transcutaneous patch as seen in our patient. CONCLUSION: Adequate nutritional counseling and supplementation before and after bariatric surgery is required to prevent complications. Transcutaneous patch as a mode of multivitamin supplementation is questionable in its current state and should be avoided."

She had frequent vomiting and decreased oral intake on the 61st day. High-calorie total parenteral nutrition was initiated on the 86th day, and levothyroxine was administered for suspected hypothyroidism. On the 88th day, she experienced altered consciousness with ocular deviation and abnormal electroencephalography findings, raising suspicion of WE. Following thiamine supplementation, recurrence of symptoms and neurological sequelae were not observed. Following 10 courses of MPT, rituximab, and mycophenolate mofetil, the patient achieved incomplete remission from SRNS.

The complex structure reveals how NSUN6 recognizes the specific CUC[CU]A consensus motif of the substrate and facilitates the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to mRNA. By combining the structural data with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based fragment screening, a virtual screening, and a further comprehensive biochemical verification, we identified thiamine disulfide as a non-SAM analog lead compound that competes with the CUC[CU]A substrate for binding to NSUN6. Our findings pave the way for the discovery of potent inhibitors for the treatment of NSUN6-driven cancers in the future.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Inadequate micronutrient intakes are common in individuals with overweight/obesityand can exacerbate cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk. Diet and exercise are primary strategies for managing overweight and may influence nutrient intakes. In this secondary analysis of dietary data collected in a randomized controlled trial (RCT, ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04019860), 15 June 2019) of time-restricted eating (TRE), high-intensity interval training (HIIT), a combination (TREHIIT), or a control group (CON), we investigated intervention effects on energy and nutrient intakes in women with overweight/obesity. METHODS: We randomized 131 women (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 27 kg/m2) to 7 weeks of TRE (≤10-h daily eating window with ad libitum energy intake), HIIT (3 sessions/week, performed at ≥90% maximal heart rate), TREHIIT, or CON. Participants recorded all energy intake in an online food diary during a baseline week (week 0) and at the end of the study (week 6 and week 7). We investigated between-group differences in changes in mean energy, macronutrient, and micronutrient intakes. RESULTS: TRE had reduced intakes of potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus compared with CON (p < 0.01). TREHIIT had non-significant reduced intakes of potassium, thiamine, magnesium, copper, and phosphorus (0.01< p < 0.05). HIIT alone did not negatively impact micronutrient intakes. TRE and TREHIIT induced suboptimal intakes for a greater number of micronutrients compared with HIIT and CON. CONCLUSIONS: A ≤10-h TRE window might increase the risk of micronutrient inadequacy in women with overweight/obesity. Future research is needed to investigate the effects of integrating nutritional guidelines with TRE interventions to mitigate the risk of micronutrient inadequacy in individuals with overweight/obesity.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin B1 (thiamine) plays an important role in human metabolism. It is essential for the proper growth and development of the body and has a positive effect on the functioning of the digestive, cardiovascular, and nervous systems. Additionally, it stimulates the brain and improves the psycho-emotional state. In vivo, vitamin B1 occurs in free form as thiamine or as its ester with phosphate residue(s), i.e., as mono-, di-, or triphosphate. It has been proven that supportive therapy with vitamin B1 can not only provide neuroprotection but also has a positive effect on advanced neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, or Huntington's disease. This paper presents studies on the effect of free thiamine (T) and thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) on the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is an enzyme considered to play an important role in the therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms of action of these compounds as potential inhibitors of AChE were evaluated using both experimental (enzymatic activity) as well as computational (molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and MM-GBSA calculations) methods. The results of the current study indicate a non-competitive type of enzyme inhibition, in contrast to the previously published works suggesting a competitive one.",

The classical triad of symptoms for WE include mental status changes, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. In contrast, more uncommon symptoms include hallucinations. Known risk factors include alcoholism, malignancies, and chronic kidney disease, particularly hemodialysis. However, WE in nonalcoholic adults is often overlooked. METHODS: We report a WE patient with lung cancer undergoing hemodialysis who presented with the uncommon symptom of active hallucinations, which were improved by thiamine replacement therapy, despite a borderline whole blood thiamine concentration. RESULTS: An 81-year-old woman with lung cancer and undergoing hemodialysis was referred to our psycho-oncology department for active hallucinations that appeared suddenly 24 days earlier. She had been diagnosed with lung cancer 6 months earlier and was undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She had no alcohol dependence or anorexia before or after admission. Physical examination revealed active visual hallucinations and delirium. On suspicion of WE, intravenous thiamine was administered. One day after administration, the hallucinations and delirium improved. Her whole blood thiamine concentration was borderline (24 ng/ml). SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: WE might be a cause of active visual hallucinations as they disappeared on thiamine administration alone. We need to be aware of risk factors such as malignancies and hemodialysis, and it is important not to overlook WE.",

High metabolic demands, such as those in acute illnesses seen in the emergency department (ED), can exacerbate thiamine deficiency. In this study, our objective was to assess the incidence of thiamine deficiency in ED oncology patients, which could lead to Wernicke's encephalopathy or other thiamine deficiency disorders if left untreated. Methods: This was a single-center prospective cohort study. We included patients with acute illness and a history of active cancer management in the ED of a large, urban hospital. We also included age and sex-matched control patients with no history of cancer who sought ED care. We excluded patients with a history of alcohol use or parenteral thiamine administration before enrollment. We recorded whole blood thiamine levels to measure total body thiamine stores and collected data on clinical variables, thiamine treatment, and adverse events. Results: In total, 87 oncology and 71 control patients were included in the study. The mean age was 62.1 ± 13.7 and 58.9 ± 12.6 years, respectively, and 48% of oncology vs. 55% of control participants were female. The most common cancers represented were colon (23%), lung (25%), prostate (10%), and breast (9%). Thiamine deficiency was significantly higher in ED oncology patients (25, 28.7%) compared to controls (6, 8.5%), odds ratio 4.4 (95% CI 1.7-11.4). None of the oncology patients with deficiency received thiamine treatment in the ED. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that thiamine deficiency is prevalent in acutely ill oncology patients, yet rarely treated in the ED."

      "abstract": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is an etiologically diverse metabolic dysfunction that, if untreated, leads to chronic hyperglycemia. Understanding the etiology of T2DM is critical, as it represents one of the most formidable medical challenges of the twenty-first century. Traditionally, insulin resistance has been recognized as the primary risk factor and a well-known consequence of type 2 diabetes. Emerging evidence suggests that branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), adipokines, and deficiencies in water-soluble vitamins, such as thiamine and pyridoxine, play significant roles in the development of insulin resistance, a key feature of T2DM. These factors are interconnected through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, which regulates various metabolic processes, including glucose transport, lipid synthesis, and inflammatory responses. Dysregulation of AMPK is linked to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome-related illnesses. Understanding the interplay between BCAAs, adipokines, vitamins, and AMPK may offer new therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus."

MRI scans revealed lesions in the corpus callosum and adjacent white matter. Despite prompt initiation of intensive treatment with high-dose thiamine and corticosteroids, the patient only partially recovered, remaining disoriented and exhibiting persistent neurological deficits during follow-up. MBD is a rare condition seen in individuals with chronic alcohol use disorder and malnutrition, often resulting in unfavorable outcomes despite prompt intervention. This case underscores the impact of the patient's young age at the onset of alcohol dependence, a low Glasgow Coma Scale score, and the presence of extracallosal lesions on his overall prognosis. We discuss the pathophysiology, presentation, and treatment. We also describe the role of each prognostic factor of MBD in an unfavourable outcome highlighting the need for a larger study to define various prognostic indicators at presentation and identify appropriate treatment approaches."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Chronic fatigue is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The gut microbiota, specifically, microbial diversity and butyrate-producing bacteria have been linked to the fatigue pathogenesis. High-dose oral thiamine reduces fatigue, potentially through gut microbiota modification. In this study, we investigated how the gut microbiota influences the efficacy of high-dose thiamine in alleviating chronic fatigue in quiescent IBD (qIBD). METHODS: We analyzed the microbiota and short-chain fatty acids concentrations in fecal samples from patients with qIBD, with (n = 40) or without (n = 20) chronic fatigue. The 40 patients with qIBD and fatigue were included in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial to assess a 4-week high-oral-dose thiamine regimen. RESULTS: Butyrate and butyrate-producing bacteria were similar in patients with and without fatigue and did not change with high-dose thiamine treatment. Notably, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was more abundant in thiamine responders compared with nonresponders both pretreatment (P = .019) and post-treatment (P = .038). The relative abundances of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Roseburia hominis, both pretreatment and post-treatment, inversely correlated with IBD fatigue score changes for patients with chronic fatigue (PRE; R = -0.48, P = .004, and R = -0.40, P = .018; POST; R = -0.42, P = .012, and R = -0.40, P = .017) respectively. CONCLUSION: Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Roseburia hominis may serve as markers for response to high-dose thiamine in alleviating chronic fatigue in patients with qIBD. The mechanistic role of gut bacteria and butyrate in patients with chronic fatigue and qIBD should be further explored."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical efficacy of vitamin B1 in patients with ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted to select ICU-AW patients treated with vitamin B1 in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University from July 2022 to December 2023. Propensity score matching was used to match the control group and observation group at a 1 : 1 ratio, considering differences in patient age, gender, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II). The control group received conventional treatment, while the observation group received vitamin B1 in addition to conventional treatment. Comparisons were made between the two groups in terms of basic information, APACHE II scores, Medical Research Council muscle strength score (MRC), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum creatinine (SCr) levels before and after treatment, mechanical ventilation time, and length of ICU stay were collected and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients with ICU-AW were included, both 15 in each group. There were no significant differences in gender, age and APACHE II score between the two groups. There were no significant differences in APACHE II score, MRC score, IL-6, CRP, SCr levels, and the duration of ventilator-assisted ventilation and ICU stay between the two groups of patients before treatment. Both groups showed improvements in APACHE II scores and MRC scores after treatment, with the observation group showing significantly greater improvement compared to the control group (APACHE II score: 10.80±1.47 vs. 12.20±1.52, MRC score: 50.40±7.10 vs. 42.00±8.78, both P < 0.05). After treatment, both groups showed significant reductions in IL-6, CRP, and SCr levels, but there were no significant differences between the observation group and control group. The observation group had significantly shorter durations of mechanical ventilation (days: 7.67±1.54 vs. 9.67±2.44, P < 0.05) and ICU stay (days: 13.33±1.72 vs. 15.13±2.56, P < 0.05) compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The use of vitamin B1 during the treatment of ICU-AW significantly improves muscle strength and reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.",

We report a case of a 52-year-old male with no history of alcohol use or significant comorbidities, presenting with impaired consciousness and severe malnutrition. Neuroimaging findings confirmed MBD, and further investigation revealed an underlying oropharyngeal malignancy that likely precipitated the disease through feeding difficulties and nutritional deficits. Analytical findings revealed severe metabolic derangements, including hypoalbuminemia and vitamin deficiencies. Despite aggressive treatment, the patient succumbed to his condition. This case highlights the importance of considering MBD in the differential diagnosis of neurological dysfunction in patients with significant malnutrition and emphasizes the need for a thorough investigation into underlying causes, including malignancy."

However, there is a dearth of studies in the literature comparing these two vitamins with each other and with a placebo regarding their efficacy against sepsis. This study aimed to investigate the outcomes associated with high-dose infusions of vitamin C and thiamine in septic patients, thereby seeking to contribute valuable insights into the optimal management of sepsis. The primary objective was to compare the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and C-reactive protein (CRP) level improvement on Day Six among the vitamin C, thiamine, and placebo groups after the intervention for five days. Methodology This prospective randomized comparative study involved 75 patients. Patients were randomized into three groups of 25 each. The first group received high-dose vitamin C infusion along with standard treatment for sepsis; the second group received high-dose thiamine infusion along with standard treatment for sepsis; and the third group, the placebo group, received only standard treatment for sepsis for five days. The SOFA score, CRP level, and other parameters were evaluated on Day Six. Results The SOFA score (p=0.043) and CRP level (p=0.0161) on Day Six were lower in the vitamin C group than in the placebo group. The CRP level on Day Six was significantly lower in the thiamine group than in the placebo group (p=0.016). The duration of vasopressor therapy was significantly lower in the vitamin C group than in the placebo group (p=0.0276) and the thiamine group (p=0.0236). Conclusions Based on our findings, vitamin C infusion helps improve the SOFA score and CRP level in sepsis patients. It can also decrease the duration of vasopressor therapy and serious adverse events whereas thiamine can reduce CRP levels in these patients."

The KI and KIO3 constituted the sources of iodine. The pumpkin, cauliflower, carrot, broccoli and beetroot were used as a matrix for the iodine applied. The nutritional value was tested based on iodine content and antioxidant activity. The content of thiamine was determined in samples of Ciabatta rolls. The antioxidant activity of Gnocchi dumplings and Ciabatta rolls was analysed before and after heat treatment (baking and cooking) and after storage. It was confirmed that the designed cereal products (Ciabatta rolls and Gnocchi dumplings) with the addition of iodine-fortified dried vegetables are a good source of iodine in the diet and can be used as an element of IDD prevention. Consuming 100 g of Ciabatta rolls (1 pc.) provides coverage of iodine demand at the level of ~6% RDA, while 100 g of Gnocchi dumplings (20 pcs.) provides ~19% RDA. The type of iodine carrier (KI or KIO3) and type of vegetable for iodine introduced into cereal products affect the content of selected nutritional value indicators, such as iodine and thiamine content and antioxidant properties of the product.",

      "abstract": "The utilisation of non-Saccharomyces yeasts in co-inoculation and non-thermal technologies for must sterilisation is becoming increasingly prevalent due to their notable utility and potential. This new approach optimises the fermentation process and contributes to facilitating the production of wines with distinctive characteristics, improving their stability, and without organoleptic repercussions. Two trials were conducted concurrently, designated as A and B, using the same Tempranillo red must. In each trial, UHPH-treated and untreated must (serving as the control) were compared. The non-Saccharomyces yeasts (Lachancea thermotolerans and Metschnikowia pulcherrima) were identical in both trials, and fermentations were terminated by a Saccharomyces cerevisiae inoculated after 7 days (ternary fermentation). In Trial A, different percentages of the initial inoculum were employed with respect to the total volume that must be fermented, with the objective of evaluating the influence and competitiveness between yeasts. Trial B was designed to investigate the impact of two nutrients that provide vitamins, energy, and protection from oxidative stress on the development of these yeasts and their metabolic expression. Microbiological analysis and measurements of oenological parameters were carried out, acidification was assessed, volatile compounds were analysed, and the colour spectrum was measured by spectrophotometry. It was observed in both trials that the prevalence of Lachancea thermotolerans (Lt) was longer than that of Metschnikowia pulcherrima (Mp) and that the use of quercetin + thiamine had a positive effect on yeast growth. Furthermore, the combination of Lt and Mp yeasts demonstrated remarkable synergy, resulting in the production of a substantial quantity of lactic acid (>5 g/L). With regard to aroma compounds, the UHPH must have exhibited a nearly twofold increase in ethyl lactate. Additionally, the total polyphenol index (TPI) was observed to be 8-10% higher in wines derived from UHPH musts, indicating that this technology may potentially safeguard against oxidation.",

      "abstract": "AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoids, vitamin C and thiamine have important biological effects in patients with sepsis and septic shock. Multiple studies have demonstrated the beneficial role of a combination therapy of vitamin C, hydrocortisone and thiamine in patients with sepsis and septic shock in terms of mortality reduction, and increase in the number of days free of ventilators and vasopressors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who had septic shock were assessed for eligibility after intensive care unit (ICU) admission. After randomization, the treatment group received a combination of vitamin C, thiamine and hydrocortisone for a duration of 96 hours (16 doses) and the control group received hydrocortisone for a duration till the patient was on vasopressors. The primary outcome assessed was ICU mortality, and the key secondary outcome was the duration free of vasopressor administration at the end of 7 days. RESULTS: A total of 86 patients were included in the study. Seventy percent of patients in the control group and 58 percent in the intervention group died during ICU stay. None of the primary and secondary outcomes were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The use of a combination of vitamin C, hydrocortisone and thiamine has no added benefits over the use of hydrocortisone alone in patients with septic shock. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this clinical trial shows that the use of a combination of vitamin C, hydrocortisone and thiamine in patients with septic shock is not useful and should not be a routine practice in critically ill septic patients.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wernicke-Korsakoff encephalopathy is a metabolic disease caused by vitamin B1 deficiency that predominantly affects alcoholic patients. Its clinical picture is characterized mainly by altered mental status with memory deficits, ophthalmoparesis, and ataxia, although other clinical manifestations may also be present. The current case presents certain clinical difficulties regarding the diagnosis when confronting an atypical presentation of a classical disease in an acute setting when a decision to administer an intravenous thrombolytic agent needs to be made. CASE PRESENTATION: This case involves a young male patient, with a history of chronic alcohol abuse, malnourished, and in poor general health, who presented with right-sided hemiparesis and language disturbance of acute onset, suggesting a left hemispheric stroke. The psychological examination was difficult due to a mix of confusion and aphasia, the latter being challenging to assess as the patient had a dismissive and highly deflective attitude toward the examiner. The initial cerebral computed tomography scan was unremarkable, in line with early imaging in ischemic stroke patients. On subsequent magnetic resonance imaging, lesions were observed in the medullo-pontine tegmentum, around the aqueduct of Sylvius, in the mamillary bodies, in the medial thalami, but also extensive bilateral cortical involvement in the frontal lobes. After receiving intravenous vitamin B1 treatment, the patient made a slow, but full, recovery, after eight weeks of hospitalization, and was subsequently transferred to a psychiatry clinic for treatment of his addiction. CONCLUSION: Atypical Wernicke-Korsakoff encephalopathy can closely mimic stroke, usually akin to a vertebro-basilar lesion. Our case is the first report we are aware of Wernicke-Korsakoff encephalopathy feigning a left hemispheric stroke with aphasia and right hemiparesis. This has implications for the emergency medicine doctor, neurologist and the stroke specialist when considering an emergency differential diagnosis for a patient with an initial normal computed tomography scan, especially in regard to deciding acute therapy."

      "abstract": "Chemotherapy, a primary method of cancer treatment, has been limited in clinical application due to its lack of specificity and tumor multidrug resistance, resulting in numerous undesired side effects. Herein, a small molecule conjugate, TDK-HCPT, was designed and synthesized, which could target tumor cells and prolong the retention of chemotherapy agents within tumor cells. Moreover, a similarly designed control system, TDK-Nap, has been developed as well to enable cancer cell imaging. Two design elements are incorporated into TDK-HCPT: the thiamine disulfide (TDS) and the thioketal subunit (tk). TDS can be reduced in the high glutathione (GSH) conditions within cancer cell to form thiazolium salt, and the resulting enhanced positive charge and lipophobicity make the system difficult to be pumped out of tumor cells, thereby effectively \"locking\" the chemotherapy drug HCPT inside the tumor cells. Additionally, the tk subunit serves as a ROS trigger, within the tumor cells, the \"locked\" HCPT were then released and activated by the high ROS conditions, optimizing its targeted potential. This allows TDK-HCPT to serve as a redox-liable molecular platform that targets cancer cells selectively which decreases cancer cell migration, retards tumor growth, and lowers tumorigenesis rates as evidenced by a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a cancer cell \"lock in\" has been shown to prevent tumorigenesis in an animal model.",

      "abstract": "Lung cancer is one of the most harmful cancers in the world, endangering the lives and health of many people. Although there are various methods to treat lung cancer at present, but lung cancer is asymptomatic in the early stages and has a high recurrence rate after late treatment which make it difficult to cure with conventional treatments. Drug combinations for the treatment of lung cancer have been used in many clinical studies. In this study, we constructed a recurrence model of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) lung cancer and used a combination of Ginsenoside H dripping pills (GH) and vinorelbine (NVB) to treat the recurrence of lung cancer. The results showed that the inhibition rate of the combined treatment of GH and NVB is 74.81% which is significantly higher than the therapeutic effect of separate use. We also used GC-TOF/MS-based metabolomics to identify differentially abundant metabolites in relapse models and explore biomarker trends. We found that there are 12 metabolite differences in the abundance of metabolites between the treatment groups (GH group, NVB group and GH-NVB group) and the model group, such as glucose 6-phosphate, palmitoleic acid, linoleic acid, guanine, allantoic acid. The differences in these metabolites involve glucose and lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and purine metabolism. We further analyzed the changes in the content of these metabolites and found that the combined use of GH and NVB can regulate purine metabolism, folate synthesis, and thiamine metabolism, ultimately reducing the abnormal increase in alkaline phosphatase (AP). This study provides a method for the treatment of lung cancer and some biomarkers for the detection of lung cancer."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Malnutrition and lack of micronutrients are seen in many patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Considering that vitamins play an important role in preventing or protecting against inflammation at the metabolic, physiological, and pathological levels, this research was aimed to investigate the effect of a number of vitamin B groups in improving UC. METHODS: Experimental colitis was induced by rectal administration of acetic acid (3%) in male Wistar rats, and mega doses of thiamine (20 mg/kg), riboflavin (15 mg/kg), pyridoxine (30 mg/kg), and cyanocobalamin (250 μg/kg) alone or in combination were administered intraperitoneally for 5 days. In another group, normal dose (1/10 of the above-mentioned doses) of four vitamins in combination was administered for 15 days (started 10 days before colitis induction). Colon tissues were weighted and evaluated in terms of macroscopic, microscopic, and biochemical markers. RESULTS: Normal dose of four vitamins in combination form and mega dose of thiamine caused a significant increase in the body weight of animals. All treatments except for pyridoxine (mega dose) diminished ulceration index, total colitis index, and colon weight compared to the control group. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels decreased significantly in all treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcerative properties of selected B vitamins improved experimental colitis regardless of the dosage and duration of treatment. Despite its beneficial effect on biochemical markers, pyridoxine had the least effect in reducing the pathological features of colitis. More studies are needed to confirm the effect of these vitamins in the clinical setting of this disease."

This 20-year-old lady had all the classic features of Wernicke's encephalopathy like confusion, nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia and ataxia. Empirical treatment was given with parenteral thiamine. MRI of the brain was suggestive of Wernicke's encephalopathy. She had transient dysphagia. MRI of the brain also revealed central pontine myelinolysis, which was the most likely cause of this dysphagia. With treatment, her condition improved significantly, supraventricular tachycardia was also corrected.

This syndrome manifests as the classic triad of megaloblastic anemia, sensorineural hearing loss, and diabetes mellitus. Here, we present the case of a one-and-a-half-year-old male infant born to non-consanguineous parents in India, a region where TRMA cases are seldom reported. At five months of age, the child exhibited the characteristic symptoms, prompting immediate treatment involving thiamine therapy, insulin administration, and blood transfusions. Notably, the child exhibited significant improvement in all aspects except for hearing loss, which conventional hearing aids failed to alleviate. However, following a cochlear implant procedure conducted within a few months, the child regained hearing abilities. This case underscores the importance of early recognition and intervention in the form of cochlear implant, demonstrating the potential to reverse TRMA symptoms and provide affected individuals with a substantially improved quality of life."

Here, Lee Kudrow's 1983 theory, that cluster headache is an overly zealous response to hypoxia, is updated according to current understandings of hypoxia detection, signaling, and sensitization. It is shown that the distinctive clinical characteristics of cluster headache (circadian timing of attacks and circannual patterning of bouts, autonomic symptoms, and agitation), risk factors (cigarette smoking; male gender), triggers (alcohol; nitroglycerin), genetic findings (GWAS studies), anatomical substrate (paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, solitary tract nucleus/NTS, and trigeminal nucleus caudalis), neurochemical features (elevated levels of galectin-3, nitric oxide, tyramine, and tryptamine), and responsiveness to treatments (verapamil, lithium, melatonin, prednisone, oxygen, and histamine desensitization) can all be understood in terms of hypoxic signaling. Novel treatment directions are hypothesized, including repurposing pharmacological antagonists of hypoxic signaling molecules (HIF-2; P2X3) for cluster headache, breath training, physical exercise, high-dose thiamine, carnosine, and the flavonoid kaempferol. The limits of current knowledge are described, and a program of basic and translational research is proposed."

Although UMI-77 has demonstrated efficacy in mitigating lung injury in sepsis, the molecular mechanisms underlying its action have not yet been fully elucidated. METHODS: This study aimed to delineate the mechanism by which UMI-77 counteracts sepsis-induced ALI using comprehensive transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. RESULTS: UMI-77 significantly ameliorated histopathological changes in the lungs of mice with sepsis-induced ALI Transcriptomic analysis revealed that 124 differentially expressed genes were modulated by UMI-77 and were predominantly implicated in chemokine-mediated signaling pathways, apoptosis regulation, and inflammatory responses. Integrated metabolomic analysis identified Atp4a, Ido1, Ctla4, and Cxcl10 as key genes, and inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP), thiamine monophosphate, thymidine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (dTMP) as key differential metabolites. UMI-77 may regulate key genes (Atp4a, Ido1, Ctla4, and Cxcl10) to affect key metabolites (IMP, thiamine monophosphate, and dTMP) and their target genes (Entpd2, Entpd1, Nt5e, and Hprt) involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, gastric acid secretion, pyrimidine, and purine metabolism in the treatment of sepsis-induced ALI. CONCLUSION: UMI-77 exerts its therapeutic effect in sepsis-induced ALI through intricate modulation of pivotal genes and metabolites, thereby influencing critical biological pathways. This study lays the groundwork for further development and clinical translation of UMI-77 as a potential therapeutic agent for sepsis-associated lung injuries."

      "abstract": "When encountering severe hypoxemia that does not respond to oxygen supplementation, it is essential to consider underlying right-to-left shunting. Among various diagnostic approaches, the microbubble test via transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is a simple, noninvasive method for detecting pulmonary arteriovenous shunts, particularly in hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). Although microbubbles are usually administered peripherally, using a Swan-Ganz (SG) catheter to inject microbubbles directly into the pulmonary artery may provide even more definitive diagnostic information. We report a case of a woman in her 60s who was admitted in cardiac arrest after several months of progressive dyspnea and one month of poor appetite. While resuscitation was successful, severe hypoxemia persisted despite intubation, mechanical ventilation, and oxygen therapy. Immediately after resuscitation, TTE revealed no intracardiac shunt but did show microbubbles in both heart chambers. The patient exhibited refractory hypoxemia, high-output status, and pulmonary hypertension. Based on a history of severe dietary irregularities, beriberi heart disease was suspected, and empirical thiamine administration improved pulmonary hypertension and high-output state; however, the hypoxemia remained unresolved. Since microbubbles had been observed in the left heart without an intracardiac shunt, a pulmonary arteriovenous shunt was suspected. Peripheral microbubble testing showed Grade 4 opacification of the left heart three to four heartbeats subsequent to the filling of the right heart. Concerns regarding hemodynamic instability and timing prompted a microbubble test via the already-placed SG catheter. Injection of microbubbles directly into the pulmonary artery again demonstrated Grade 4 opacification in the left heart alone, confirming a pulmonary arteriovenous shunt independent of intracardiac pathways. The patient later died on day six due to irreversible brain damage. The autopsy revealed cirrhosis with histopathological features of autoimmune hepatitis and pulmonary changes suggestive of a pulmonary arteriovenous shunt. Postmortem evaluations indicated low vitamin B1 levels, consistent with beriberi heart disease, and the presence of autoimmune markers suggesting Sjögren's syndrome. In beriberi heart disease, high output is associated with reduced vascular resistance and increased metabolic demand. In liver disease, excessive nitric oxide and carbon monoxide production may worsen these hemodynamic conditions, promoting pulmonary vasodilation and pulmonary arteriovenous shunt formation. Using the SG catheter for the microbubble test proved practical and effective, especially when standard peripheral methods are complicated by hemodynamic instability, difficulty visualizing the right heart, the potential presence of intracardiac shunts, or contraindications to transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). This technique, relying on commonly available cardiovascular equipment, may facilitate earlier diagnosis of shunt-related diseases in complex clinical scenarios."

CONCLUSION: Wernicke encephalopathy is a consequence of thiamine deficiency, commonly seen in patients with alcohol use disorder but also with other causes of nutritional deficiency, such as hyperemesis gravidarum. Wernicke encephalopathy is a clinical diagnosis that requires a high degree of suspicion and is, therefore, often missed in the ED setting. Treatment is supplemental thiamine and management of the root cause for nutritional deficiency."

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is the main pathogenic factor of various cardiovascular diseases. During the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, macrophages play a major role, mainly by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines and taking in lipids to form foam cells. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) is an antagonist of the P2Y6 receptor, which is overexpressed on macrophages during atherosclerosis and facilitates the lipid phagocytosis of macrophages. However, the excessive accumulation of TPP may interfere with some vital metabolic processes like the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation and the pentose phosphate pathway. Herein, we designed and constructed a nanoparticle ZIF-8@TPP for the treatment of atherosclerosis. The as-established ZIF-8@TPP nanoplatform exhibited specific cytotoxicity towards macrophages in vitro. Meanwhile, histological analysis confirmed the excellent therapeutic efficacy of ZIF-8@TPP in vivo. Mechanistic studies indicated that ZIF-8@TPP potentially lowered lipid phagocytosis and lipid metabolism of macrophages via the PI3K/AKT/MSR1 pathway. This study also demonstrated that the anti-atherosclerotic effect of TPP was enhanced after combination with a prototypical metal-organic framework (MOF), ZIF-8. This synergistic controlled-release drug delivery system may provide a novel idea for anti-atherosclerosis therapy by combining reagents that can inhibit lipid phagocytosis of macrophages with MOFs.",

      "abstract": "Sepsis is a prevalent form of acute and critical illness encountered in intensive care unit (ICU), characterized by a high mortality and cognitive impairments among survivors. The pathogenesis of sepsis primarily involves immune dysfunction and excessive oxidative stress. Consequently, immune modulation, along with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant strategies, has emerged as a focal point in the treatment of sepsis. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of B vitamins to modulate immune cell activity while exhibiting anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, thereby garnering significant interest regarding their therapeutic efficacy in sepsis management. Notably, vitamin B2 and vitamin B9 are recognized for their roles in regulating immune cells and facilitating immune modulation. Vitamins B1, B2, B6, and B12 demonstrate notable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Specifically, vitamin B1 exerts its antioxidant influence through the regulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle while mitigating inflammation by modulating inflammatory factor levels in septic patients-an application that has been integrated into clinical practice. The anti-inflammatory action of vitamin B2 is achieved through the regulation of inflammatory mediators in septic patients alongside reducing inflammasome activation within macrophages. Vitamin B6 contributes to both anti-inflammatory responses and antioxidative defense by scavenging free radicals and enhancing the production of antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, vitamins B1, B6, B9, and B14 have shown promise in improving neurocognitive function among individuals suffering from sepsis. This article reviews the immunomodulatory functions as well as the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects associated with various B vitamins while exploring their applications within sepsis treatment to propose novel therapeutic avenues.",

The effect of produce type, sanitizer, and ultrasound treatment on removal of PRV and TV from produce and artificial surfaces was also investigated. Sanitization was performed with two oxidant-based sanitizers (chlorine and peroxyacetic acid) and one surfactant-based sanitizer (0.5 % malic acid +0.05 % thiamine lauryl sulfate) in combination with ultrasound. PRV and TV were spot inoculated to fresh and artificial produce surfaces and treated for 1 min with a sanitizing solution with and without ultrasound. No significant differences were observed in the attachment of PRV and TV to fresh and artificial leaf surfaces. The removal of PRV from produce leaves treated by different sanitizers was significantly higher than that of TV. No difference in viral removal between the fresh and artificial produce surfaces was found. The addition of ultrasound significantly increased viral removal from both type of produce surfaces. The removal of virus attached to fresh and artificial phylloplanes was virus-type, sanitizer-type, and produce cultivar dependent. Artificial phylloplanes may provide a novel platform for screening of sanitizers in food safety applications.",

Research indicates that certain nucleotides, such as cytidine and uridine, along with vitamins B1 and B12, may help alleviate pain and enhance QoL. This study assessed the impact of adding a supplement containing cytidine and uridine nucleotides and vitamins B1 and B12, alongside standard treatment, on radiculopathy-associated pain. Methods: A multicenter, prospective, two-cohort, randomized, open-label study was conducted. The control group received standard treatment, while the experimental group received standard treatment plus the supplement. The primary endpoint was pain reduction measured by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Secondary endpoints included functional improvement (Roland Morris questionnaire), clinical improvement (Clinical Global Impression [CGI] scale), and QoL improvement (EQ-5D-5L questionnaire). Results: A total of 122 patients were included from 17 centers across Spain. Both groups showed pain improvement, but the VAS reduction (control: 24.58 vs. experimental: 31.35) was not statistically significant. The Roland Morris score decreased significantly in the experimental group (estimate: -1.70, 95% CI -3.29 to -0.10; p = 0.038), and these patients were 5 times more likely to progress to a better CGI category (OR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.57; p = 0.003). No significant differences were observed in EQ-5D-5L scores or analgesic consumption. Conclusions: The addition of supplemental pyrimidine nucleotides and vitamins B1 and B12 to standard of care treatment improved radiculopathy functional and clinical outcomes. Regarding pain, however, although there was a numerical improvement, it did not reach statistical significance.",

      "abstract": "Anoectochilus roxburghii (Wall.) Lind. has significant medicinal and economic value, and the social demand for this species is increasing annually. Laser light sources have different luminescent mechanisms compared with ordinary light sources and are also important factors regulating the synthesis of functional metabolites in A. roxburghii. However, the regulatory mechanism through which A. roxburghii responds to blue laser light has not been investigated. Previous studies have shown that blue-laser treatment results in more red leaves than blue- or white-light treatment. Here, the differences in the effects of laser treatment on A. roxburghii were analyzed by transcriptome sequencing. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that the membranes, calcium ion binding, brassinosteroid-mediated signaling pathway and response to salicylic acid play important roles in the response of A. roxburghii to blue laser light. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis revealed the involvement of multiple pathways in the response to blue-laser treatment, and among these, beta biosynthesis, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, thiamine metabolism, limonene and pinene biosynthesis, and peroxisomes play core roles. Cytoscape interaction analysis of the differentially expressed miRNA targets indicated that novel_miR_66, novel_miR_78 and novel_miR_212 were most likely involved in the effect of blue laser light on A. roxburghii. Metabolic content measurements showed that blue laser light increased the beet red pigment, thiamine, total flavonoid and limonene contents, and qPCR analysis confirmed that novel_miR_21, novel_miR_66, novel_miR_188 and novel_miR_194 might participate in the blue-laser signaling network through their target genes and thereby regulate the functional metabolite accumulation in A. roxburghii. This study provides a scientific basis for high-yield A. roxburghii production.",

This study aimed to investigate the synergistic effect of donepezil and each of vitamin B12, vitamin B6 and vitamin B1 on aluminium chloride (AlCl3)-induced neurotoxicity in rats. Fifty-four rats were divided into nine groups of six. Group I received distilled water, group II-AlCl3 (100 mg/kg), group III- AlCl3 (100 mg/kg) + Donepezil (10 mg/kg), group IV-AlCl3(100 mg/kg) + Donepezil (10 mg/kg) + Vitamin B12 (5 mg/kg), group V-AlCl3 (100 mg/kg) + Donepezil (10 mg/kg) + Vitamin B6 (5 mg/kg), group VI-AlCl3 (100 mg/kg) + Donepezil (10 mg/kg) + Vitamin B1 (5 mg/kg), group VII-AlCl3 (100 mg/kg) + Vitamin B12 (5 mg/kg), group VIII-AlCl3 (100 mg/kg) + Vitamin B6 (5 mg/kg), group IX-AlCl3 (100 mg/kg) + Vitamin B1 (5 mg/kg). Treatment lasted for 40 days. Biochemical analyses of the brain revealed that chronic administration of AlCl3 significantly increased the level of inflammatory cytokines, caspase 9, malondialdehyde, nitric oxide and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, while causing a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, Nrf2, reduced glutathione, dopamine and norepinephrine. Results also showed that AlCl3 caused cognitive impairment as indicated by a reduction in the percentage alternation index and hypo-activity towards novel object in animals treated with AlCl3 only. Moreover, results from biochemical evaluations indicated that treatment with donepezil, B vitamins and combination of donepezil and B vitamins attenuated the deficits in dopamine, norepinephrine, Nrf2, SOD and reduced glutathione, while also reducing the elevated levels of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, AChE, caspase 9 and inflammatory markers. These observations were corroborated by result of histopathological evaluation. The combination of donepezil and vitamin B12, B6 and B1 proved to be more effective than donepezil monotherapy. Donepezil conferred significant protection against AlCl3-induced neurotoxicity, however, the combination of donepezil and vitamin B12, vitamin B6 and Vitamin B1 significantly performed better in neuroprotective indices than donepezil monotherapy. The combination of donepezil and vitamin B1 was better amongst the three combination therapies in this study.",

      "abstract": "Diet has been found to significantly influence gut microbiota throughout various life stages, and gut microbiota have been increasingly shown to influence host physiology, health, and behavior. This study uses 16S rRNA sequencing to examine the effects of six different fat-supplemented diets (canola oil, coconut oil, fish oil, flaxseed oil, lard, and olive oil) on broiler chicken cecal microbial composition and predicted function in comparison with a common and inexpensive fat source (poultry fat). Groups of broilers were fed each of these diets and then evaluated on day 41 and day 55 of age. For both 41- and 55-day samples, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla were the dominant bacteria in the ceca accounting for 99% of the microbial community. Across the 41- and 55-day samples, treatment time was associated with a stronger and more significant microbiota shift (p < 0.001) than differences in dietary treatment alone (p = 0.117), but dietary treatment combined with treatment time is a significant factor as well (p = 0.047). Sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis was used to explore the more discriminating taxa for each treatment group. For identified species, butyrate production appears to be affected in a diet-specific manner, with many butyrate-producing species being evident for the fish-based diet at day 41 and a few of these species for the flaxseed-based diet at day 55. Predicted functions, as conducted with PICRUSt2, were significant for comparisons between the control and the flaxseed-based dietary treatment group at day 55, with indications of host health benefit for the flaxseed-based diet. Predicted functions found to be significant were for enzymes and pathways such as propionate CoA ligase, aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase, vitamin B12-transporting ATPase, thiamine kinase, acetylneuraminate epimerase, and L-tryptophan biosynthesis. This study provides insight surrounding specific dietary fat-based treatments to be investigated further and highlights the importance of polyunsaturated fat sources in poultry feed that may offer a favorable cecal microbial modulation compared to saturated fat sources."

In this study, we present Au nanoparticle decorated CoAl layered double hydroxide monolayer (Au@CoAl-LDH-m) as a peroxidase-like (POD) nanozyme for the sensitive colorimetric detection of AChE and its inhibitor, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). Remarkably, the Au@CoAl-LDH-m nanozyme can catalyze the oxidation of chromogenic substrates through its POD-like activity, which is effectively inhibited by thiocholine (TCh, a catalytic product of AChE), thereby enabling detection of AChE and TPP through a visible colorimetric readout. The approach provides a highly sensitive and specificity assay with a broader linear response range (1-100 mU mL-1 for AChE and 1-1000 ng mL-1 for TPP) and a low detection limit (0.092 mU mL-1 for AChE and 0.201 ng mL-1 for TPP), respectively. These results highlight the significant potential of Au@CoAl-LDH-m for advancing colorimetric sensors in detecting small molecules across various biological applications.",

Early recognition and treatment are crucial for improving outcomes. We report a case of MDB that was diagnosed in a 43-year-old woman with a history of chronic alcohol use and a 15-day history of progressive neurological symptoms, including impaired speech, confusion, and inability to walk independently. Brain MRI findings were consistent with MBD, showing acute demyelination of the anterior corpus callosum. The patient was treated with high-dose intravenous thiamine and B vitamins, resulting in a gradual and significant improvement.

Patients with preexisting risk factors such as parenteral nutrition (PN) dependence, eating disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, or surgeries are especially vulnerable. CASE SUMMARY: A 9-year-old girl with short bowel syndrome receiving long-term PN, including standard thiamine supplementation, presented with refractory shock following aspiration. Profound hyperlactatemia, cardiac dysfunction, and vasoactive requirements persisted despite extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and resolved only after treatment with parenteral thiamine. CONCLUSIONS: Hemodynamic collapse due to thiamine deficiency (Shoshin beriberi) may occur during acute illness in children with nutritional risk factors and should be considered in refractory hyperlactatemia. Timely treatment with parenteral thiamine can support dramatic hemodynamic recovery. Treatment of suspected thiamine deficiency should not be delayed for laboratory confirmation as current thiamine reference ranges correlate poorly with clinical severity, and functional testing may not be readily available.",

      "abstract": "Micronutrient deficiencies can hurt the health of women of reproductive age (WRA), their pregnancy outcomes, and the growth and development of their offspring in sub-Saharan African countries. The present study aimed to estimate the dietary intake of non-pregnant and non-lactating (NPNL) WRA, residing in seven districts of the Mbeya region in Tanzania using a 24-hour dietary recall. A cross sectional study was conducted among 500 NPNL WRA. A two-stage sampling method was used, three enumeration areas (EAs) were chosen for each district using the probability proportional to size and, 24 eligible households were randomly selected from each chosen EA.The SAS macros (version 9.4) were used to analyse the quantities consumed and explore the usual intakes of three fortified food vehicles. The median intake of oil, wheat flour, and calories was 36.47g, 110.53g, and 2,169.9 kcal, respectively. The median protein intake was 63.5g, higher than the recommended value of 56.0g. Among the micronutrients, zinc had the highest prevalence of inadequate intake (91.2%), followed by iron (82.2%), and vitamin B12 (80.0%). Vitamin E had the highest nutrient gap (50.7%), while the nutrient gap in Q1 was relatively low (9.8%). There was a moderate prevalence of inadequate intake of vitamin C (46.5%) and riboflavin (54.8%), with a nutrient gap in Q1 (42%). Inadequate intake of vitamin A, thiamine, niacin, vitamin B6, and folate was moderate, ranging from 32.6% to 44.4%, with a nutrient gap at Q1 ranging from 16.2% to 34%. Our study has revealed a prevalent inadequate intake of micronutrients among NPNL WRA. Furthermore, our findings suggest that fortifying oil represents a promising intervention. However, fortified wheat flour had limited reach among NPNL WRA in the Mbeya region of Tanzania."

      "abstract": "Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is an acute neurological disorder arising from thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, characterized by a classic triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and altered mental status. While it is more common in males, it can occur in various contexts, including pregnancy. Leptospirosis, a zoonotic infection, can co-occur with other illnesses such as scrub typhus. We present a case of a 27-year-old primigravida in her second trimester who developed WE, presenting with altered sensorium, fever, and neurological deficits. Initial examination revealed ophthalmoplegia and confusion, with MRI confirming typical findings of WE. Investigations indicated co-infection with leptospirosis and scrub typhus, along with abnormal liver function tests. Treatment with intravenous thiamine resulted in symptomatic improvement. This case underscores the critical role of early diagnosis and treatment of WE, especially in pregnant patients with poor nutritional intake or hyperemesis gravidarum. Imaging studies, particularly MRI, enhance diagnostic accuracy. The patient's condition was exacerbated by concurrent infections affecting liver function and thiamine reserves. WE, though rare in pregnancy, should be suspected in cases of nutritional deficiency and acute illness. Prompt recognition and thiamine supplementation are essential to prevent severe complications, including motor deficits and mortality."

      "abstract": "Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is a carcinogenic environmental pollutant widely present in the environment and can enter the human body through the food chain. It is therefore essential to treat and remediate the B[a]P-contaminated environment. Microbial remediation of B[a]P-contaminated environments is considered to be one of the most effective strategies, and the addition of biostimulants is a feasible method to further improve the effectiveness of microbial remediation. In this study, we used Bacillus subtilis MSC4 to screen for the stimulation of sodium gluconate, which promoted B[a]P degradation. Based on biochemical and transcriptomic analyses, Sodium gluconate was found to significantly increase the biomass of MSC4 and the expression of most genes involved in B[a]P degradation. Activities of central carbon metabolism, fatty acid β-oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation were all promoted. The significant increase in acid-induced oxalate decarboxylase expression indicates a decrease in intracellular pH, which promoted the synthesis of acetoin and lactate. Genes involved in the nitrogen cycle, especially nitrification and denitrification, were significantly up-regulated, contributing to B[a]P degradation. Genes involved in the synthesis of enzyme cofactors, including thiamine, molybdenum cofactors, NAD and heme, were up-regulated, which contributes to increasing enzyme activity in metabolic pathways. Up-regulation of genes in flagella assembly, chemotaxis, and lipopeptide synthesis is beneficial for the dissolution and uptake of B[a]P. Genes related to the sugar transport system were upregulated, which facilitates the transport and absorption of monosaccharides and oligosaccharides by MSC4. This study provides a theoretical basis for the further application of sodium gluconate in the treatment of PAH-contaminated sites.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Thiamine and ascorbic acid have been proposed to mitigate the devastating consequences of sepsis and septic shock. To date, randomized controlled trials have failed to demonstrate a benefit of these therapies and heterogeneity of treatment effect is suspected. In this study, we aimed at assessing the heterogeneity of treatment effect of thiamine (B1) and the combination of B1 plus ascorbic acid (AA + B1) in critically ill patients with sepsis. METHODS: We conducted a bi-centric retrospective cohort study. All adult patients admitted to the ICU with sepsis or septic shock between January 2012 and August 2022 were included. Patient clusters were identified using latent variable analysis based on demographics and physiological variables obtained within 24 h of admission. Within each cluster and using inverse probability weighted Cox models, we compared in-hospital mortality between patients who received standard treatment (control), standard treatment plus B1 (B1 group), and standard treatment plus a combination of thiamine and ascorbic acid (AA + B1 group). RESULTS: A total of 3465 septic patients were included, 2183, 1054 and 228 in the standard, B1 and AA + B1 groups respectively. Five clusters of patients were identified in an unsupervised manner. The \"Cluster Severe\" included the most severely ill patients, the \"Cluster Resp\" patients presented with predominantly respiratory failure, the \"Cluster Old\" included elderly patients with multiple comorbidities, the \"Cluster Fit\" patients were young, healthy with low severity indices and \"Cluster Liver\" included patients with predominant liver failure. B1 treatment was associated with different outcomes across the five clusters. It was associated with a lower in-hospital mortality in the \"Cluster Severe\" and \"Cluster Resp\". On the other hand, the combination of thiamine and ascorbic acid was not associated with reduced mortality in any cluster but an increased mortality in\"Cluster Old\". CONCLUSIONS: These results reinforce the lack of efficacy of the combination of AA + B1 reported in recent trials and even raise concerns about potential harm in older patients with comorbidities. On the contrary, we reported improved ICU survival associated with B1 supplementation in the most severe patients and those with predominant respiratory failure, supporting the need for further trials in this specific population.",

Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a symptom that is reported by a subset of OSA patients, persisting even after treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). It is recognized as a clinical subtype underlying OSA carrying alarming heightened cardiovascular risk. Thus, conceptualizing EDS as an exposure variable, we sought to investigate EDS's influence on genetic variation linked to apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), a diagnostic measure of OSA severity. This study serves as the first large-scale genome-wide gene x environment interaction analysis for AHI, investigating the interplay between its genetic markers and EDS across and within specific sex. Our work pools together whole genome sequencing data from seven cohorts, enabling a diverse dataset (four population backgrounds) of over 11,500 samples. Among the total 16 discovered genetic targets with interaction evidence with EDS, eight are previously unreported for OSA, including CCDC3, MARCHF1, and MED31 identified in all sexes; TMEM26, CPSF4L, and PI4K2B identified in males; and RAP1GAP and YY1 identified in females. We discuss connections to insulin resistance, thiamine deficiency, and resveratrol use that may be worthy of therapeutic consideration for excessively sleepy OSA patients."

      "abstract": "In several plant species, thiamin foliar application primes plant immunity and can be effective in controlling various diseases. However, the effectiveness of thiamin against potato pathogens has seldom been investigated. Additionally, the transcriptomics and metabolomics of immune priming by thiamin have not previously been investigated. Here, we tested the effect of thiamin application against Alternaria solani, the causal agent of early blight in potato, and identified associated changes in gene expression and metabolite content. Thiamin applied on foliage at an optimal concentration of 10 mM reduced lesion size by ∼33%. However, prevention of lesion growth was temporally limited, as a reduction of lesion size occurred when leaves were inoculated 4 h, but not 24 h, following thiamin treatment. Additionally, the effect of thiamin on lesion size was restricted to the application site and was not systemic. RNA-seq analysis showed that thiamin affected the expression of 308 genes involved in the synthesis of salicylic acid, secondary metabolites, fatty acid, chitin, primary metabolism, and photosynthesis. Genes in these pathways were also amongst the thousands of genes differentially regulated in the response to the pathogen alone, though they were often more differentially expressed and enriched when thiamin and the pathogen were combined. Thiamin also delayed the downregulation of photosynthesis-associated genes in plants inoculated with A. solani. Metabolite analyses revealed that thiamin treatment in the absence of a pathogen decreased the amounts of several organic compounds involved in the citric acid cycle. We hypothesize that thiamin primes plant defenses through perturbation of primary metabolism.",

Some studies suggest that lifestyle, particularly diet, could represent a risk factor for obesity and its metabolic complications in these patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate diet quality and eating habits in individuals with TRS. Seventeen participants (13M/4F aged 37.8±13 years) were recruited to assess dietary composition and food groups consumption by a 7days food record to assess. In addition, demographic and clinical data were collected. RESULTS: Most of the participants were overweight/obese (82%) and only 35% performed physical activity. As compared to nutritional recommendations, participants presented an insufficient intake of fiber (15.9±3.2 g/day), vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, vitamin A, D, and E), minerals (calcium, magnesium, selenium, and iron), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (2.11±0.8%), likely triggered by the low consumption plant-based foods (legumes, fruit, vegetables, and nuts) and fish. Participants exceeded the intake of saturated fatty acids (11.6±3.4%) and cholesterol (242±124 mg/day), and simple sugars (15.2±3.9%) which were mainly related to greater consumption of red meat and processed meat, and sweet foods, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with TRS presented low diet quality and did not comply with the nutritional recommendations. These results support the importance of including nutritional assessment in the management of individuals with TRS."

This systematic review assessed whether, in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, any drug therapy, compared to placebo or usual care, improves outcomes. METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and The International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for randomized controlled trials of drug therapy in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest (last searched 20th October 2024). The primary outcome was mortality at 30 days/hospital discharge. Other outcomes reflected those of the Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane Risk-Of-Bias Version 1. Studies of steroids, coenzyme Q10 and thiamine were meta-analysed. RESULTS: From 2562 records, 207 full texts were screened and 45 studies (5800 patients) investigating 30 therapies were included. Studies were grouped thematically as supportive drug therapies (n = 10), neuroprotective agents (n = 19), and anti-inflammatory/antioxidants (n = 16). Four studies reported reduced mortality at 30 days/hospital discharge: one of the anticholinergic penehyclidine hydrochloride, two of intra-arrest vasopressin and methylprednisolone plus hydrocortisone for post resuscitation shock, and one of the traditional Chinese medicine, shenfu. Studies of steroids, coenzyme Q10 and thiamine were meta-analysed. We could not detect an effect on mortality with steroids (n = 739, risk ratio (RR), 0.93; 95 % CI 0.83-1.04, p = 0.21; I2 = 60 %, low certainty), coenzyme Q10 (n = 107, RR, 0.91; 95 % CI 0.61-1.37, p = 0.65; I2 = 0 %, low certainty), or thiamine (n = 149, RR, 1.11; 95 % CI 0.88-1.40, p = 0.39; I2 = 0 %, very low certainty). CONCLUSION: In comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, the majority of trials of drug therapy reported no effect on mortality. Meta-analyses of steroids, coenzyme Q10 and thiamine demonstrated no evidence of an effect on mortality. However, the low certainty of evidence warrants further research.",

      "abstract": "The risk of developing diabetes and cardiometabolic disorders is associated with increased levels of alpha-aminoadipic acid and disturbances in the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids. The side effects of the widely used antidiabetic drug metformin include impaired degradation of branched-chain amino acids and inhibition of intracellular thiamin transport. These effects may be interconnected, as thiamine deficiency impairs the functioning of thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent dehydrogenases of 2-oxo acids involved in amino acids degradation, while diabetes is often associated with perturbed thiamine status. In this work, we investigate the action of metformin in rats with impaired thiamine availability. The reduction in the thiamine influx is induced by simultaneous administration of the thiamine transporters inhibitors metformin and amprolium. After 24 days of combined metformin/amprolium administration, no significant changes in the total brain levels of ThDP or activities of ThDP-dependent enzymes of central metabolism are observed, but the affinities of transketolase and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase to ThDP increase. The treatment also significantly elevates the brain levels of free amino acids and ammonia, reduces the antioxidant defense, and alters the sympathetic/parasympathetic regulation, which is evident from changes in the ECG and behavioral parameters. Strong positive correlations between brain ThDP levels and contents of ammonia, glutathione disulfide, alpha-aminoadipate, glycine, citrulline, and ethanolamine are observed in the metformin/amprolium-treated rats, but not in the control animals. Analysis of the obtained data points to a switch in the metabolic impact of ThDP from the antioxidant and nitrogen-sparing in the control rats to the pro-oxidant and hyperammonemic in the metformin/amprolium-treated rats. As a result, metformin administration along with the amprolium-reduced thiamine supply significantly perturb the metabolism of amino acids in the rat brain, altering behavioral and ECG parameters.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is one of the common malignant tumors in clinical practice, and traditional Chinese medicine, as an important adjuvant treatment method, plays important roles in the treatment of malignant tumors. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the mechanism of action of the Qizhu anti-cancer recipe on colorectal cancer through transcriptome sequencing. METHODS: The control group and Qizhu anti-cancer recipe group were established separately, and sequencing of the cells of the two groups was performed using the Illumina sequencing platform. Two sets of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were screened using the DESeq2 algorithm, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Reactome, Disease Ontology (DO), and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) were used to comprehensively analyze the molecular functions and signaling pathways enriched by DEGs. RESULT: A total of 122 DEGs were identified through differential analysis, including 24 upregulated genes and 98 downregulated genes. GO analysis showed that DEGs were mainly enriched in functions such as alkaline phase activity, ion transport, cell differentiation, etc.; KEGG analysis showed that DEGs were mainly enriched in pathways such as Thiamine metabolism, apoptosis, signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells, cellular senescence and so on. Reactom analysis showed that DEGs were mainly enriched in response pathways such as EGR1,2,3 bind to the NAB2 promoter, EGR binds ARC gene, EGR-dependent NAB2 gene expression, etc.; DO analysis showed that differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in diseases such as disease of cellular proliferation, disease of anatomical entity, organ system cancer, etc.; PPI analysis identified key differentially expressed genes, including DDIT3, CHAC1, TRIB3, and ASNS. CONCLUSION: Based on transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, it was found that the Qizhu anti-cancer recipe may involve DEGs and signaling pathways in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Our study may provide potential drug targets for developing new treatment strategies for colorectal cancer."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a potentially life-threatening disorder associated with severe alterations in metabolism and acid-base status. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with diabetes and its complications. Thiamine and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) are important factors in aerobic metabolism. In this study, we measured cellular oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) and the effects of in vitro administration of thiamine and CoQ10 on OCRs in patients with DKA versus healthy controls. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from a prospective cohort of patients with DKA and from controls. Cellular OCRs were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) without treatment and after treatment with thiamine, CoQ10, or both. The mitochondrial profile was measured using an XFe96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer and XF Cell Mito Stress Test Kit (Seahorse Bioscience). A linear quantile mixed model was used to compare OCRs and estimate treatment effects. RESULTS: A total of 62 patients with DKA and 48 controls were included in the study. The median basal and maximal OCRs were lower in the DKA group than in the control group (basal: 4.7 [IQR: 3.3, 7.9] vs. 7.9 [5.0, 9.5], p = 0.036; maximal: 16.4 [9.5, 28.1] vs. 31.5 [20.6, 46.0] pmol/min/µg protein, p < 0.001). In DKA samples, basal and maximal OCRs were significantly increased when treated with thiamine, CoQ10, or both. In controls, basal and maximal OCR were significantly increased only with thiamine treatment. CONCLUSION: Mitochondrial metabolic profiles of patients with DKA demonstrated lower cellular oxygen consumption when compared to healthy controls. Oxygen consumption increased significantly in cells of patients with DKA treated with thiamine or CoQ10. These results suggest that thiamine and CoQ10 could potentially have therapeutic benefits in DKA via their metabolic effects on mitochondrial cellular respiration."

      "abstract": "Artemisia abyssinica and Artemisia arborescens are unique plants that show significant bioactive properties and are used for the treatment of a variety of diseases. This study assessed the nutritional values, functional properties, chemical composition, and bioactive attributes of these plants as functional nutritional supplements. Compared to A. arborescens, A. abyssinica had higher fat (4.76%), fiber (16.07%), total carbohydrates (55.87%), and energy (302.15 kcal/100 g DW), along with superior functional properties, including higher water and oil absorption capacities (638.81% and 425.85%, respectively) and foaming capacity and stability (25.67% and 58.48%). The investigation of volatile compounds found that A. abyssinica had higher amounts of hotrienol (4.53%), yomogi alcohol (3.92%), caryophyllene (3.67%), and carvotanacetone (3.64%), which possess anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties. Artemisia abyssinica contributed over 30% of the recommended dietary intake (RDI) of amino acids. It displayed superior levels of sodium (31.46 mg/100 g DW) and calcium (238.07 mg/100 g DW). It also exhibited higher levels of organic acids, particularly malic acid, butyric acid, and succinic acid, compared to A. arborescens. Fatty acid analysis revealed palmitic and linoleic acids as primary components in both plants, with A. abyssinica having a higher palmitic acid content. Artemisia abyssinica also had higher vitamin C and thiamine levels. Although A. arborescens showed the highest total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant activity, and capacity, A. abyssinica demonstrated acceptable efficiency in TPC and antioxidant content. These findings highlight the potential of both Artemisia species, particularly A. abyssinica, as valuable sources of nutrients and bioactive compounds for various applications."

      "abstract": "Thiamine is metabolized into thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), an essential enzyme cofactor. Previous work has shown that oxythiamine, a thiamine analog, is metabolized by thiamine pyrophosphokinase (TPK) into oxythiamine pyrophosphate within the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and then inhibits TPP-dependent enzymes, killing the parasite in vitro and in vivo. To identify a more potent antiplasmodial thiamine analog, 11 commercially available compounds were tested against P. falciparum and P. knowlesi. Five active compounds were identified, but only N3-pyridyl thiamine (N3PT), a potent transketolase inhibitor and candidate anticancer lead compound, was found to suppress P. falciparum proliferation with an IC50 value 10-fold lower than that of oxythiamine. N3PT was active against P. knowlesi and was >17 times less toxic to human fibroblasts, as compared to oxythiamine. Increasing the extracellular thiamine concentration reduced the antiplasmodial activity of N3PT, consistent with N3PT competing with thiamine/TPP. A transgenic P. falciparum line overexpressing TPK was found to be hypersensitized to N3PT. Docking studies showed an almost identical binding mode in TPK between thiamine and N3PT. Furthermore, we show that [3H]thiamine accumulation, resulting from a combination of transport and metabolism, in isolated parasites is reduced by N3PT. Treatment of P. berghei-infected mice with 200 mg/kg/day N3PT reduced their parasitemia, prolonged their time to malaria symptoms, and appeared to be non-toxic to mice. Collectively, our studies are consistent with N3PT competing with thiamine for TPK binding and inhibiting parasite proliferation by reducing TPP production, and/or being converted into a TPP antimetabolite that inhibits TPP-dependent enzymes.",
