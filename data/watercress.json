      "abstract": "Plant-derived compounds are renowned for their remarkable pharmacological properties, holding immense promise for therapeutic interventions in human health. In this study, we aimed to assess the antimicrobial, anti-hemolytic, antioxidant, and wound healing attributes of watercress oil incorporated into Vaseline gel (OLG) compared to watercress oil alone. OLG was formulated through a meticulous process involving the addition of Vaseline gel to the oil under agitation conditions. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of watercress oil unveiled a rich array of phenolic compounds, including gallic acid (10.18 μg/mL), daidzein (3.46 μg/mL), and hesperetin (3.28 μg/mL). The inhibitory zones caused by watercress oil alone against a spectrum of pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans, were measured at 25 ± 0.3, 26 ± 0.1, 22 ± 0.2, 25 ± 0.2, and 24 ± 0.1 mm, respectively. Notably, OLG exhibited slightly larger zones of inhibition (27 ± 0.2, 30 ± 0.2, 24 ± 0.1, 28 ± 0.1, and 25 ± 0.3 mm) against the same microbial strains. Furthermore, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of OLG against E. coli and E. faecalis was lower compared to watercress oil alone, indicating enhanced efficacy. Similarly, the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of OLG was notably lower across all tested bacteria compared to watercress oil alone. Inhibition of bacterial hemolysis, particularly K. pneumoniae, was significantly enhanced with OLG treatment, showcasing reductions of 19.4%, 11.6%, and 6.8% at 25%, 50%, and 75% MIC concentrations, respectively, compared to watercress oil alone. The antioxidant activity of both oil and OLG was quantified with IC50 values of 2.56 and 3.02 μg/mL, respectively. Moreover, OLG demonstrated remarkable efficacy in wound healing assays, with notable enhancements in migration rate, wound closure, and area difference compared to control cells. In light of the observed antibacterial, antifungal, anti-hemolytic, and wound healing properties of OLG, this formulation holds therapeutic potential in treating microbial infections and promoting wound healing."

Although these genes have been shown to respond to heat and drought stresses, their role in flavonoid synthesis remains unclear. In this study, NoMYB60 was cloned from watercress and its structure and function were analyzed. Sequence structure analysis showed that NoMYB60 had a highly conserved R2R3 DNA-binding region at the N-terminus. Under the treatment of ABA, SA or MeJA, the expression level of NoMYB60 first significantly increased and then decreased, indicating that ABA, SA and MeJA positively regulated NoMYB60. The subcellular localization of NoMYB60-GFP indicated that NoMYB60 was localized in the nuclear region, which is consistent with the molecular characterization of the transcription factor. Gene silencing experiments were also performed to further test the function of NoMYB60. The result showed that virus-induced silencing of NoMYB60 affected the expression of enzyme genes in flavonoid synthesis pathways and promoted the synthesis of flavonoids. Moreover, we discovered that NoMYB60 interacts with NoBEH1/2. In this study, provides a reference for research on the regulation mechanism of flavonoid synthesis in Cruciferae and other crops.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Hair loss and greying affect men and women of all ages, often causing psychosocial difficulties. Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), a major hair loss factor secreted from dermal papilla (DP) cells in response to the secretion of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), has been reported to induce and accelerate androgenetic alopecia (AGA). In addition, DKK1 acts as a potent suppressor of melanogenesis and is closely related to hair colour. R-spondin 1 (RSPO1) is a secretory agonist of Wnt signalling known to antagonize the effects of DKK1, including DKK1-mediated hair follicle suppression. In this study, we investigated the effect of watercress extract (WCE) on the secretion of RSPO1 and DKK1 from DP cells as well as its anti-hair loss effect in human hair follicles and patients. METHODS: The in vitro secretion of RSPO1 and DKK1 was measured by ELISA. Human hair follicles were collected from the scalp of a female donor and used for ex vivo organ culture to investigate the effects of WCE on human hair loss. Finally, a 6-month human clinical trial was conducted to examine the effect of WCE-containing lotion on hair growth in a male panel. RESULTS: WCE significantly upregulated RSPO1 secretion and suppressed DKK1 secretion in a dose-dependent manner, even in the presence of DHT. WCE-treated hair follicles elongated 1.6-fold compared with the control, and the level of RSPO1 production in DP as well as RSPO1 bound to the outer root sheath (ORS) increased. In the clinical trial, the hair lotion containing 2% WCE increased hair thickness and density to improve against hair loss symptoms. CONCLUSION: WCE exhibited a strong anti-androgenic effect through its ability to suppress DKK1 secretion and antagonize DKK1 via RSPO1. These findings highlighted the potential use of WCE for the treatment of hair loss.",

      "abstract": "Watercress (Nasturtium officinale R. Br.) is an important aquatic herb species belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It has various medicinal properties and has been utilized for the treatment of cancer and other diseases; however, currently available genomic information regarding this species is limited. Here, we performed the first comprehensive analysis of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway (CBP) genes of N. officinale, which were identified from next-generation sequencing data. We identified and characterized 11 putative carotenoid pathway genes; among these, nine full and two partial open reading frames were determined. These genes were closely related to CBP genes of the other higher plants in the phylogenetic tree. Three-dimensional structure analysis and multiple alignments revealed several distinct conserved motifs, including aspartate or glutamate residues, carotene-binding motifs, and dinucleotide-binding motifs. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results showed that the CBP was expressed in a tissue-specific manner: expression levels of NoPSY, NoPDS, NoZDS-p, NoCrtISO, NoLCYE, NoCHXE-p, and NoCCD were highest in the flower, whereas NoLCYB, NoCHXB, NoZEP, and NoNCED were highest in the leaves. Stems, roots, and seeds did not show a significant change in the expression compared to the leaves and flowers. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the same organs showed the presence of seven distinct carotenoid compounds. The total carotenoid content was highest in the leaves followed by flowers, seeds, stems, and roots. Among the seven individual carotenoids, the levels of six carotenoids (i.e., 13-Z-β-carotene, 9-Z-β-carotene, E-β-carotene, lutein, violaxanthin, and β-cryptoxanthin) were highest in the leaves. The highest content was observed for lutein, followed by E-β-carotene, and 9-Z-β-carotene; these carotenoids were much higher in the leaves compared to the other organs. The results will be useful references for further molecular genetics and functional studies involving this species and other closely related species."

      "abstract": "The study has proved the stimulating effects of different strategies of treatments with elicitors on the production of glucosinolates (GSLs), flavonoids, polyphenols, saccharides, and photosynthetic pigments in watercress (Nasturtium officinale) microshoot cultures. The study also assessed antioxidant and anti-melanin activities. The following elicitors were tested: ethephon (ETH), methyl jasmonate (MeJA), sodium salicylate (NaSA), and yeast extract (YeE) and were added on day 10 of the growth period. Cultures not treated with the elicitor were used as control. The total GSL content estimations and UHPLC-DAD-MS/MS analyses showed that elicitation influenced the qualitative and quantitative profiles of GSLs. MeJA stimulated the production of gluconasturtiin (68.34 mg/100 g dried weight (DW)) and glucobrassicin (65.95 mg/100 g DW). The elicitation also increased flavonoid accumulation (max. 1131.33 mg/100 g DW, for 100 μM NaSA, collection after 24 h). The elicitors did not boost the total polyphenol content. NaSA at 100 μM increased the production of total chlorophyll a and b (5.7 times after 24 h of treatment), and 50 μM NaSA caused a 6.5 times higher production of carotenoids after 8 days of treatment. The antioxidant potential (assessed with the CUPRAC FRAP and DPPH assays) increased most after 24 h of treatment with 100 μM MeJA. The assessment of anti-melanin activities showed that the microshoot extracts were able to cause inhibition of tyrosinase (max. 27.84% for 1250 µg/mL). KEY POINTS: • Elicitation stimulated of the metabolite production in N. officinale microshoots. • High production of pro-health glucosinolates and polyphenols was obtained. • N. officinale microshoots have got tyrosinase inhibition potential. • The antioxidant potential of N. officinale microshoots was evaluated.",

      "abstract": "The vegetable watercress (Nasturtium officinale R.Br.) is, besides being a generally nutritious food, a rich source of glucosinolates. Gluconasturtiin, the predominant glucosinolate in watercress, has been shown to have several health beneficial properties through its bioactive breakdown product phenethyl isothiocyanate. Little is known about the immunoregulatory effects of watercress. Moreover, anti-inflammatory effects have mostly been shown in in vitro or in animal models. Hence, we conducted a proof-of-concept study to investigate the effects of watercress on the human immune system. In a cross-over intervention study, 19 healthy subjects (26.5 ± 4.3 years; 14 males, 5 females) were given a single dose (85 g) of fresh self-grown watercress or a control meal. Two hours later, a 30 min high-intensity workout was conducted to promote exercise-induced inflammation. Blood samples were drawn before, 5 min after, and 3 h after the exercise unit. Inflammatory blood markers (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, MCP-1, MMP-9) were analyzed in whole blood cultures after ex vivo immune cell stimulation via lipopolysaccharides. A mild pro-inflammatory reaction was observed after watercress consumption indicated by an increase in IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, whereas the immune response was more pronounced for both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α) after the exercise unit compared to the control meal. During the recovery phase, watercress consumption led to a stronger anti-inflammatory downregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α. In conclusion, we propose that watercress causes a stronger pro-inflammatory response and anti-inflammatory counter-regulation during and after exercise. The clinical relevance of these changes should be verified in future studies."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disorder is a main public health concern. Inflammatory processes and oxidative stress are common in end-stage renal disease patients. We aimed to evaluate the effect of the hydroalcoholic extract of watercress (WC) on the inflammatory cytokines and protein carbonyl (PCO) contents in chronic hemodialysis patients. METHODS: This was a double-blind randomized clinical trial performed on 46 hemodialysis patients. The participants were randomly divided into two groups: intervention group (500 mg hydroalcoholic extract of WC every day for 4 weeks) and control group (500 mg of white flour every night for 4 weeks). The blood samples were taken to determine the levels of vitamin E, PCO, and inflammatory cytokines at baseline and the end of treatment. RESULTS: Forty-five patients completed the study (22 patients in the intervention group and 23 patients in the control group). There was a significant reduction in the PCO level (20.33 ± 4.40 vs. 15.06 ± 6.41, P=0.001) in the intervention group; also, this change was statistically significant relative to the control group. Furthermore, there were significant reductions in hs-CRP (8953.30 ± 5588.06 vs. 7249.86 ± 5091.62, P=0.007) and IL-6 (60.10 (55.99, 73.10) vs. 55.21 (53.39, 60.48), P=0.050) in the intervention group, but these changes were not significant in comparison with the control group. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the hydroalcoholic extract of WC reduced the PCO content in hemodialysis patients via inhibition of protein oxidation. Although WC administration had caused a significant reduction in IL-6 and CRP levels, these differences were not statistically significant relative to the control group. Further research is needed to identify the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of WC in hemodialysis patients."

      "abstract": "Watercress (WC) is an aquatic vegetable that belongs to the Brassicaceae family, and it often grows near water. In traditional medicine, WC is a known remedy for hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, arthritis, bronchitis, diuresis, odontalgia, and scurvy. It also acts as an antiestrogenic and can be used as a nutritional supplement. It has been reported that these therapeutic effects are due to primary metabolites such as isothiocyanates, glucosinolates, polyphenols (flavonoids, phenolic acids, and proanthocyanidins), vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B6, E, and C), terpenes (including carotenoids), and bioelements which exist in this plant. Many pharmacological studies confirm the antioxidant, antibacterial, anticancer, antipsoriatic, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, renoprotective, hepatoprotective, and antigenotoxicity effects of WC. The consumption of WC extract can be useful in reducing the complications of hypercholesterolemia and hyperglycemia. Furthermore, the extract of WC could markedly augment the antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase activity. Interestingly, consumption of food rich in polyphenols such as WC extract can help reduce oxidative stress, DNA damage, and cancer susceptibility. Several studies also showed that WC extract significantly reduced liver injury as a result of cholestatic hepatic injury, gamma radiation, arsenic, and acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity. In this review, the researchers focus on the phytochemical and biochemical characterizations of WC and its therapeutic effects in the treatment of human diseases."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic disease of the lungs caused by inflammation, species of reactive oxygen, and immune defects. Antioxidant properties of Nasturtium officinale has been reported in some studies. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to evaluate the effect of ethanolic extract of Nasturtium officinale (EENO) on bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis in rats. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Forty adult male Wistar rats (180-220 g) were randomly divided into 5 experimental groups. Normal control, BLM control received a single dose of BLM (6 IU/kg) intratracheally only on the first day, EENO + BLM group received EENO (500 mg/kg) one week before intratracheal BLM instillation and two weeks afterward, BLM + EENO group and BML + vitamin E group received EENO (500 mg/kg) and vitamin E (500 mg/kg) half-hour after BLM installation, respectively. The animals were sacrificed on day 22. Change in body weight, lung index, serum level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) metabolite, lung tissue hydroxyproline content and lung pathology were assessed. FINDINGS/RESULTS: Pre- or post-treatment with EENO attenuated pulmonary fibrosis as evidenced by normalized lung index, improved histological changes and inhibited collagen deposition (hydroxyproline) in the animal lung. EENO also decreased MDA and NO metabolite release in comparison to the BLM control. vitamin E (500 mg/ kg) also significantly inhibited the BLM-induced lung toxicity. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: EENO can prevent BLM-induced lung fibrosis in rats via antioxidant activities. However, more studies are needed to elicit the exact mechanism of this effect."

      "abstract": "Cholestatic liver disease is recognized by extreme collagen formation and deposition, which is mediated by free radicals. The aim of the current study was to investigate the probable hepatoprotective effects of hydroalcoholic extract of watercress (WC) against oxidative stress and liver injury in bile duct ligation (BDL)- induced cholestatic rats. A total of 32 male Wistar rats were divided into four groups; sham control (SC), BDL, SC + hydroalcoholic extract of WC and BDL + hydroalcoholic extract of WC. WC-treated rats received daily WC 500 mg/kg/day for 10 days. Biochemical tests, hepatic oxidative stress markers, and antioxidant enzymes activity were estimated. Further, liver hydroxyproline content was assayed and histological analysis was made. The BDL model markedly elevated the protein carbonyl (PCO) and hydroxyproline contents and decreased the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. Hydroalcoholic extract of WC significantly decreased the surge in liver PCO and hydroxyproline levels and increased the reduced GPx enzyme activity contents in the hepatic tissue. As determined by hematoxylin and eosin staining, BDL considerably induced hepatocyte necrosis. Moreover, these changes were significantly attenuated by the hydroalcoholic extract of WC treatment. Our data indicate that the hydroalcoholic extract of WC extract attenuated liver damage in BDL rats by decreasing the hydroxyproline content and histopathological indexes. Also, it reduced oxidative stress by preventing the hepatic protein oxidation and enhancing the activity of the GPx enzyme via antioxidative effect and free-radical scavenging. Our findings suggest that hydroalcoholic extract of WC could be a beneficial new curative agent for cholestatic liver damage.",

In watercress, the irradiation treatment of up to 5 kGy reduced the loss of total folates caused by 7 days of storage. In turn, the 12-day storage period did not affect the total folate content of buckler sorrel (while the 2 kGy dose decreased the initial levels), evidencing that packaging and refrigeration are enough for preservation.

The lowering of total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol should reduce the incidence of coronary disease. The aim of the present study was to examine the antihyperlipidemic and antidiabetic effects of the hydroalcoholic extract of watercress (Nasturtium officinale) leaves in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. METHODS: Female Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: control, diabetic and diabetic rats treated with the extract of watercress (Nasturtium officinale) at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg. Diabetic rats received the watercress extract daily in drinking water for 4 weeks since the day after diabetes confirmation. The levels of serum glucose and lipids were spectrophotometrically measured in all groups at weeks 0 (before diabetes induction), 2 and 4. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in serum glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, accompanied by a decrease in high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. The treatment of diabetic rats with hydroalcoholic extract of watercress (Nasturtium officinale) leaves over a 4-week period significantly reduced serum glucose, total cholesterol and LDL- cholesterol in comparison with diabetic untreated rats. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that a 4-week treatment with watercress extract at a dose of 200 mg/kg has hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. This implies that the consumption of watercress leaves can be helpful in reducing the complications of hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia associated with diabetes.",

Br.) and 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate, a natural compound derived gluconasturtiin largely present in watercress tissues, with a standard antibiotic, a synergy study was carried out against 11 isolates of extended-spectrum β-lactamases-Escherichia coli. Aqueous and methanolic watercress extracts and 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate were combined with the antibiotic, and a disc diffusion assay and minimum inhibitory concentration methods were used to assess the in vitro antibacterial activity. The results of this study showed that there is an increase in antibacterial activity of the antibiotic when it was combined with plants extracts and pure compounds. The most interesting result was the combination between 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate and the antibiotic. Synergistic effects of the antibiotic with watercress extracts and 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate suggest the potential of these plants and their natural compounds to improve the performance of the antibiotics and could be an interesting tool for antimicrobial therapy. The results led us to conclude that watercress has important pharmacological substances which can be used for developing new and effective antimicrobial agents. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This in vitro study intends to demonstrate the potential use of watercress extracts and 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate as antimicrobial tools against extended-spectrum β-lactamases-Escherichia coli and to determine their ability to act synergistically with commercial standard antibiotics. We intended to increase the knowledge about different clinical and pharmaceutical approaches to fight against E. coli rather than the traditional use of antibiotics. The results may be useful to those involved in the pharmaceutical, biochemical and microbiology industry and/or academic research in terms of developing alternative control measures and efficient intervention methods.",

      "abstract": "Pharmacological antioxidant vitamins have previously been investigated for a prophylactic effect against exercise-induced oxidative stress. However, large doses are often required and may lead to a state of pro-oxidation and oxidative damage. Watercress contains an array of nutritional compounds such as β-carotene and α-tocopherol which may increase protection against exercise-induced oxidative stress. The present randomised controlled investigation was designed to test the hypothesis that acute (consumption 2 h before exercise) and chronic (8 weeks consumption) watercress supplementation can attenuate exercise-induced oxidative stress. A total of ten apparently healthy male subjects (age 23 (SD 4) years, stature 179 (SD 10) cm and body mass 74 (SD 15) kg) were recruited to complete the 8-week chronic watercress intervention period (and then 8 weeks of control, with no ingestion) of the experiment before crossing over in order to compete the single-dose acute phase (with control, no ingestion). Blood samples were taken at baseline (pre-supplementation), at rest (pre-exercise) and following exercise. Each subject completed an incremental exercise test to volitional exhaustion following chronic and acute watercress supplementation or control. The main findings show an exercise-induced increase in DNA damage and lipid peroxidation over both acute and chronic control supplementation phases (P< 0.05 v. supplementation), while acute and chronic watercress attenuated DNA damage and lipid peroxidation and decreased H₂O₂ accumulation following exhaustive exercise (P< 0.05 v. control). A marked increase in the main lipid-soluble antioxidants (α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol and xanthophyll) was observed following watercress supplementation (P< 0.05 v. control) in both experimental phases. These findings suggest that short- and long-term watercress ingestion has potential antioxidant effects against exercise-induced DNA damage and lipid peroxidation.",

Hematological parameters such as red blood cells (RBC) and white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hb), RBC index like mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) as well as immunological parameters such as peroxidase, lysozyme and complement activities, total protein, albumin and globulin levels were measured after 21 days of watercress extract treatment. The results indicated that oral administration of 1 % watercress extract in fish may enhance some hematological and immunological parameters including Hb and MCHC, lysozyme and complement activities, total protein and globulin levels, compared to the controls after 21 days of experimental period. In conclusion, on the basis of these results, oral administration of watercress extract may be useful to improve fish's immune system."

Oxidative DNA damage seems to play a crucial role in chronic, aging-related diseases and it is considered an important and probably carcinogenic factor. The aim of this work was to determine the impact of watercress extract on cell viability and its potential antigenotoxic properties against induced oxidative damage, using a comet assay and peripheral blood cells as an in vitro model. An aqueous extract of the leaves was prepared using a juice processor, centrifuged, filtered and preserved at -20 °C. Two concentrations of the aqueous extract (13.2 and 26.4 mg/mL) were assayed. No differences were found in cell viability between the control and treated groups at any time. Significant antigenotoxic effects were observed for both concentrations, expressed as the damage index (p = 0.005 at 30 min; p < 0.001 at 60 and 90 min), the percentage reductions in damage being similar between them (67.1-75.2% respectively).

After 14 days, accumulation of lipid peroxidation in stems and leaves and changes in activity of antioxidant enzymes were determined spectrophotometrically. The maximum accumulation was observed in the highest concentration group. In this group, lipid peroxidation levels were three times higher than the control group in the stem and leaves. The highest induction in SOD and GR activities were determined at 200 mg/L Pb group in stem, whereas CAT and AP activities were higher than other groups at the concentration of 250 and 100 mg/L Pb, respectively. The increase in CAT activity was found to be greater than GR, SOD, and AP activities in stems of watercress under Pb treatment. Both lead accumulation and antioxidant enzyme responses were higher in stems than in leaves. The results of the present study suggested that the induction in antioxidant responses could be occurring as an adaptive mechanism to the oxidative potential of lead accumulation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies indicate that consumption of cruciferous vegetables (CV) can reduce the risk of cancer. Supposed mechanisms are partly the inhibition of phase I and the induction of phase II enzymes. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro and in vivo effects of watercress (WC), a member of the CV family, on chemopreventive parameters using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as surrogate cells. We investigated the hypothesis that WC reduces cancer risk by inducing detoxification enzymes in a genotype-dependent manner. METHODS: In vitro gene expression and enzyme activity experiments used PBMC incubated with a crude extract from fresh watercress (WCE, 0.1-10 microL/mL with 8.2 g WC per 1 mL extract) or with one main key compound phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC, 1-10 microM). From an in vivo perspective, gene expression and glutathione S-transferase (GST) polymorphisms were determined in PBMC obtained from a human intervention study in which subjects consumed 85 g WC per day for 8 weeks. The influence of WC consumption on gene expression was determined for detoxification enzymes such as superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1), whilst the SOD and GPX activities in red blood cells were also analysed with respect to GST genotypes. RESULTS: In vitro exposure of PBMC to WCE or PEITC (24 h) increased gene expression for both detoxification enzymes GPX1 (5.5-fold, 1 microL/mL WCE, 3.7-fold 1 microM PEITC) and SOD2 (12.1-fold, 10 microL/mL WCE, 7.3-fold, 10 microM PEITC), and increased SOD2 activity (1.9-fold, 10 microL/mL WCE). The WC intervention had no significant effect on in vivo PBMC gene expression, as high individual variations were observed. However, a small but significant increase in GPX (p = 0.025) and SOD enzyme activity (p = 0.054) in red blood cells was observed in GSTM1*0, but not in GSTM1*1 individuals, whilst the GSTT1 genotype had no impact. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that WC is able to modulate the enzymes SOD and GPX in blood cells in vitro and in vivo, and suggest that the capacity of moderate intake of CV to induce detoxification is dependent in part on the GSTM1 genotype.",

Internodes of ca. 1 cm excised from in vitro stock shoot culture were placed on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 3 muM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid as a pre-treatment. Laser scanning microscopy indicated clearly that the first sign of meristematic cell division could be seen after 1-2 days of pre-culture, and meristematic tissues multiplied along the vascular cambium of the internode segment during 7 days of culture. Multiple shoots could be obtained from more than 90% of the pre-treated explants when they were subsequently transferred to MS medium supplemented with 1 muM thidiazuron for 3 weeks. These findings indicate that pre-treatment of the internodes for 7 days promoted their capacity for organogenesis.

      "abstract": "Watercress (Nasturtium officinale R. Br.) is a perennial herb rich in the secondary metabolites of glucosinolates and carotenoids. 2-phenethyl isothiocyanate, the predominate isothiocyanate hydrolysis product in watercress, can reduce carcinogen activation through inhibition of phase I enzymes and induction of phase II enzymes. Sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) have been shown to influence concentrations of both glucosinolates and carotenoids in a variety of vegetable crops. Our research objectives were to determine how several levels of N and S fertility interact to affect watercress plant tissue biomass production, tissue C/N ratios, concentrations of plant pigments, and glucosinolate concentrations. Watercress was grown using nutrient solution culture under a three by three factorial arrangement, with three S (8, 16, and 32 mg/L) and three N (6, 56, and 106 mg/L) fertility concentrations. Watercress shoot tissue biomass, tissue %N, and tissue C/N ratios were influenced by N but were unaffected by changes in S concentrations or by the interaction of NxS. Tissue pigment concentrations of beta-carotene, lutein, 5,6-epoxylutein, neoxanthin, zeaxanthin, and the chlorophyll pigments responded to changes in N treatment concentrations but were unaffected by S concentrations or through N x S interactions. Watercress tissue concentrations of aromatic, indole, and total glucosinolate concentrations responded to changes in N treatments; whereas aliphatic, aromatic, and total glucosinolates responded to changes in S treatment concentrations. Individual glucosinolates of glucobrassicin, 4-methoxyglucobrassicin, and gluconasturriin responded to N fertility treatments, while gluconapin, glucobrassicin, and gluconasturiin responded to changes in S fertility concentrations. Increases in carotenoid and glucosinolate concentrations through fertility management would be expected to influence the nutritional value of watercress in human diets.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cruciferous vegetable (CV) consumption is associated with a reduced risk of several cancers in epidemiologic studies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of watercress (a CV) supplementation on biomarkers related to cancer risk in healthy adults. DESIGN: A single-blind, randomized, crossover study was conducted in 30 men and 30 women (30 smokers and 30 nonsmokers) with a mean age of 33 y (range: 19-55 y). The subjects were fed 85 g raw watercress daily for 8 wk in addition to their habitual diet. The effect of supplementation was measured on a range of endpoints, including DNA damage in lymphocytes (with the comet assay), activity of detoxifying enzymes (glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) in erythrocytes, plasma antioxidants (retinol, ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol, lutein, and beta-carotene), plasma total antioxidant status with the use of the ferric reducing ability of plasma assay, and plasma lipid profile. RESULTS: Watercress supplementation (active compared with control phase) was associated with reductions in basal DNA damage (by 17%; P = 0.03), in basal plus oxidative purine DNA damage (by 23.9%; P = 0.002), and in basal DNA damage in response to ex vivo hydrogen peroxide challenge (by 9.4%; P = 0.07). Beneficial changes seen after watercress intervention were greater and more significant in smokers than in nonsmokers. Plasma lutein and beta-carotene increased significantly by 100% and 33% (P < 0.001), respectively, after watercress supplementation. CONCLUSION: The results support the theory that consumption of watercress can be linked to a reduced risk of cancer via decreased damage to DNA and possible modulation of antioxidant status by increasing carotenoid concentrations.",

A third chlorzoxazone pharmacokinetic study was performed after a 1-week treatment with isoniazid (300 mg/day), a well-known CYP2E1 inhibitor. Ingestion of watercress or isoniazid did not affect the oral absorption of chlorzoxazone. The area under the chlorzoxazone plasma concentration-time curve was significantly increased by 56% (p < 0.05) after watercress ingestion and by 135% (p < 0.001) with isoniazid treatment. Similarly, chlorzoxazone elimination half-life was prolonged after watercress (53%; p < 0.05) and isoniazid (104%; p < 0.01) administration. These results show that a single ingestion of watercress inhibits the hydroxylation of chlorzoxazone, an in vivo probe for CYP2E1.",

      "abstract": "To investigate the effect of the consumption of watercress (Nasturtium officinale R. Br.), a cruciferous vegetable, on acetaminophen metabolism, the pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen and its metabolites were studied in a crossover trial of human volunteers. A single oral dose of acetaminophen (1 gm) was given 10 hours after ingestion of watercress homogenates (50 gm). In comparison with acetaminophen only, the ingestion of watercress resulted in a significant reduction in the area under the plasma cysteine acetaminophen (Cys-acetaminophen) concentration-time curve and in the peak plasma Cys-acetaminophen concentration by 28% +/- 3% and by 21% +/- 4% (mean +/- SE; n = 7; p < 0.005), respectively. Correspondingly, the Cys-acetaminophen formation rate constant and Cys-acetaminophen formation fraction were decreased by 55% +/- 9% and 52% +/- 7% (p < 0.01), respectively. Consistent with the results obtained from the plasma, the total urinary excretion of Cys-acetaminophen in 24 hours was also reduced. A decrease of mercapturate acetaminophen, a Cys-acetaminophen metabolite, was also shown in the plasma and urine samples. However, the plasma pharmacokinetic processes and the urinary excretions of acetaminophen, acetaminophen glucuronide, and acetaminophen sulfate were not altered significantly by the watercress treatment. These results suggest that the consumption of watercress causes a decrease in the levels of oxidative metabolites of acetaminophen, probably due to inhibition of oxidative metabolism of this drug.",
