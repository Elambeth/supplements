      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Periodontitis and dental caries are among the most prevalent oral diseases, with chronic periodontitis being a multifactorial, infectious condition that leads to inflammation in the supporting structures of the teeth, progressive attachment loss, and bone resorption. Chronic periodontitis is driven by a consortium of pathogenic microorganisms. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of virgin coconut oil (VCO) pulling in reducing the microbial load and inflammatory mediators responsible for chronic periodontitis, in comparison to chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash and distilled water. METHODS: Thirty patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis were randomly allocated into three groups. Group A served as the control and used distilled water for oral rinsing, Group B used chlorhexidine mouthwash, and Group C performed oil pulling with virgin coconut oil. Pre-operative subgingival plaque samples were collected from all participants, followed by complete scaling and root planing. Post-operative samples were collected after four weeks. Both pre- and post-treatment samples were subjected to real-time PCR (rtPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to quantify viral and bacterial loads, as well as levels of key inflammatory mediators. RESULTS: A significant reduction in viral load, bacterial load, and inflammatory mediators was observed in both the VCO and CHX groups compared to the distilled water group. The reductions in the VCO and CHX groups were statistically significant, with comparable efficacy between the two interventions. CONCLUSION: Virgin coconut oil pulling demonstrated a significant reduction in microbial and inflammatory markers in patients with chronic periodontitis, showing similar efficacy to chlorhexidine mouthwash. Given its comparable therapeutic effects and reduced side effect profile, VCO presents a viable alternative to chlorhexidine for managing chronic periodontitis."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of sesame oil pulling in periodontitis with/without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), compared to chlorhexidine, for its oral and systemic health benefits. METHOD AND MATERIALS: A total of 120 periodontitis patients, without (Group A; 60)/with (Group B; 60) T2DM, underwent control (chlorhexidine 0.12%; Group A1 and B1) and test (sesame oil pulling; Group A2 and B2) interventions. Plaque index, pocket depth, salivary total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay (ELISA), subgingival plaque BANA test, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated at baseline and 30 days post-intervention using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a significant P value set at .05. Group B serum samples were also analyzed for fructosamine and lipid profile. RESULTS: Both treatment regimens were equivalent in reduction of plaque, pocket depth, and red complex periodontopathogens in Group A and B. Significant increase in salivary T-AOC post-intervention was observed in Group B with both interventions (P .01). Sesame oil pulling significantly decreased systemic CRP and triglyceride levels, with no difference observed with chlorhexidine in Group B. CONCLUSION: Sesame oil pulling is equivalent to chlorhexidine for anti-plaque, antibacterial, and antioxidant effects in periodontitis patients with/without T2DM. Systemic anti-inflammatory, cardio-protective benefits (reduction of CRP and triglycerides) make it a better adjunct to scaling and root planing than chlorhexidine in periodontitis with T2DM.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To compare the plaque reducing efficacy of oil pulling with sesame oil compared to distilled water in a randomized, controlled, examiner-blinded parallel group study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty probands without advanced periodontal disease of the University Hospital for Restorative Dentistry and Periodontology, Medical University of Innsbruck (Austria) were randomized allocated to test- (sesame oil) or control group (distilled water) and asked to pull daily in the morning for eight weeks with their allotted fluid for 15 min. Rustogi Modified Navy Plaque Index (RMNPI) and gingival bleeding index were assessed at baseline and after four and eight weeks. Plaque samples underwent microbiological analysis. RESULTS: Pulling with sesame oil was significantly more effective in reducing full mouth RMNPI compared to distilled water after eight weeks (median reduction 18.98% versus 10.49%; p = 0.023), and was most pronounced in anterior, buccal, and lingual subscales. On approximal surfaces, significantly higher plaque reduction was found in the test group after four (24.07% versus 14.29%) and eight weeks (16.00% versus 5.36%) of intervention (p < 0.05). No significant changes in gingival index and mirobiological analysis could be detected. CONCLUSION: Plaque reduction was statistically significantly higher with oil pulling than with distilled water, however, a study bias cannot be ruled out. Further high-quality trials are needed to understand the mechanisms and effectiveness of oil pulling, to finally clarify the evidence. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Oil pulling may be recommended as an adjuvant to mechanical dental cleaning. Individuals with keratosis may experience adverse effects.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fixed orthodontic appliances create areas of plaque stagnation leading to an increase in the volume, structure, and composition of plaque. This increases the chances of decalcification and white spot lesions. Oil pulling, an ancient practice involving swishing oil in the mouth, has demonstrated a significant reduction in plaque scores after 45 days, and a reduction in salivary Streptococcus mutans concentration in few studies done in nonorthodontic subjects. The aim was to compare the concentration of S. mutans in plaque around orthodontic brackets in patients using oil pulling with sesame oil and those on routine oral hygiene. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty subjects requiring fixed orthodontic treatment were divided into two equal groups: Group A-Oil pulling and Group B-Control. All subjects were instructed to follow common oral hygiene methods and in addition, Group A was instructed to perform oil pulling for 30 days starting 1 month after placement of fixed appliances. Plaque specimens were collected from labial surfaces of maxillary lateral incisors and quantification of S. mutans was done using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Mean and standard deviations for descriptive statistics, paired, and unpaired sample t-tests were analyzed. RESULTS: Comparison of S. mutans concentration between T1 and T2 demonstrated a significant difference in both control and study groups. The experimental group showed significantly lesser S. mutans concentration compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Oil-pulling therapy with sesame oil resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the concentration of S. mutans in the plaque around orthodontic brackets.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: A meta-analytic review was performed to critically synthesize the evidence of oil pulling on improving the parameters of gingival health, plaque control and bacteria counts against chlorhexidine and other mouthwash or oral hygiene practices. METHODS: Databases including Medline, Embase and bibliographies were searched from inception to 1 April 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 7 days or longer duration of oil pulling with edible oils in comparison to chlorhexidine or other mouthwashes or oral hygiene practice concerning the parameters of plaque index scores (PI), gingival index scores (GI), modified gingival index scores (MGI) and bacteria counts were included. Cochrane's Risk of Bias (ROB) tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework were employed to determine the quality of evidence. Two authors independently conducted study selection and data extraction. Meta-analyses of the effect of oil pulling on the parameters were conducted using an inverse-variance random-effects model. RESULTS: Twenty-five trials involving 1184 participants were included. Twenty-one trials comparing oil pulling (n = 535) to chlorhexidine (n = 286) and non-chlorhexidine intervention (n = 205) were pooled for meta-analysis. More than half of the trials (n = 17) involved participants with no reported oral health issues. The duration of intervention ranged from 7 to 45 days, with half of the trials using sesame oil. When compared to non-chlorhexidine mouthwash interventions, oil pulling clinically and significantly improved MGI scores (Standardized mean difference, SMD = -1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.31, -0.97). Chlorhexidine was more effective in reducing the PI scores compared to oil pulling, with an SMD of 0.33 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.49). The overall quality of the body of evidence was very low. CONCLUSIONS: There was a probable benefit of oil pulling in improving gingival health. Chlorhexidine remained superior in reducing the amount of plaque, compared to oil pulling. However, there was very low certainty in the evidence albeit the clinically beneficial effect of oil pulling intervention.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of extra virgin olive (EVO) oil and fruity oil for the treatment of gingivitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample of 75 patients over 18 years of age with gingivitis induced by plaque bacteria was divided into three groups: study group A, with extra virgin olive oil; study group B, with fruity oil; and control group C. In the two study groups, EVO oil was administered as a mouthwash to patients with gingival inflammation. The protocol included a daily application of the product for 30 days, with three recalls 15 days apart. Clinical parameters of plaque formation and gingivitis, including plaque index (PI) and bleeding index (BI), were assessed at each recall and scored on a specific periodontal chart. The control group received no mouthwash treatment in addition to normal daily oral hygiene procedures, and the same clinical parameters as the study group were evaluated. Data were evaluated using SPSS 27.0 software for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Then, the pre- and post-treatment values of the groups were compared using Student's t-test, setting p < 0.05 as the significance level. RESULTS: Comparison of the three groups showed that extra-virgin olive oil was an adjuvant in the treatment of gingival inflammation, improving PI and BI. In group A, the mean plaque index showed a 48% reduction, and the bleeding index showed a 64% reduction after 30 days. In group B, the mean plaque index showed a 35% reduction and a bleeding index reduction of 43% after 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: The collected data showed significant improvements in the formation of bacterial plaque and gingivitis. The exact mechanism of such treatment is still to be elucidated. As a result of this, further studies with a different sample of patients than those used and a comparison with other products need to be addressed to verify and demonstrate the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects of the components of this natural product."

METHODS: This clinical observer-masked, randomized, crossover designed study involved 24 participants. The participants received professional prophylaxis in the preparatory period and after that subjects started to use the allocated mouthrinse (coconut oil or sesame oil). On day 5, periodontal clinical parameters including plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), stain index (SI) and bleeding on probing (BOP) were recorded. Subjects underwent a 14-day wash out period and then used the other mouthrinse for 4 days. RESULTS: Oil pulling therapy with coconut oil or sesame oil exhibited similar plaque regrowth inhibition (PI = 1.60 ± 0.28 and 1.49 ± 0.22, for oil pulling with coconut oil and sesame oil, respectively) and tooth staining (SI = 0.20 ± 0.11 and 0.21 ± 0.09, for oil pulling with coconut oil and sesame oil, respectively.)

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Coconut oil is a cheap and accessible oil for many people around the world. There are numerous advocates for the practice of oil pulling to prevent common oral diseases. Therefore determining the effectiveness of oil pulling with coconut oil could potentially have monumental benefits. This review aimed to assess the effect of oil pulling with coconut oil in improving oral health and dental hygiene. DATA: We included randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of oil pulling with coconut oil on improving oral health and dental hygiene.No meta-analysis was performed due to the clinical heterogeneity and differences in the reporting of data among the included studies. SOURCES: Six electronic databases were screened: PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, AMED, CENTRAL and CINAHL. STUDY SELECTION: Electronic searches yielded 42 eligible studies, of which four RCTs including 182 participants were included. The studies lasted between 7 and 14 days. Significant differences were demonstrated for a reduction in salivary bacterial colony count (p = 0.03) and plaque index score (p=<0.001). One study also demonstrated a significant difference in staining compared to using Chlorhexidine (p = 0.0002). However, data was insufficient for conclusive findings, the quality of studies was mixed and risk of bias was high. CONCLUSION: The limited evidence suggests that oil pulling with coconut oil may have a beneficial effect on improving oral health and dental hygiene. Future clinical trials are of merit considering the universal availability of the intervention. Prospective research should have a robust design with rigorous execution to provide a higher quality of evidence. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Oil pulling with coconut oil could be used as a adjunct to normal preventative regimes to improve oral health and dental hygiene although further studies are needed to determine the level of effectiveness."

AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of a probiotic mouthwash, sesame oil pulling therapy, and chlorhexidine-based mouth-wash on plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation in schoolchildren aged 10 to 12 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The randomized controlled trial included 45 healthy schoolchildren aged 10 to 12 years and studying in Government High School, Tiruchengode, Tamil Nadu, India. The participants were randomly divided into three groups, I, II, and III, with 15 children in each group as follows: group I: probiotic mouthwash; group II: chlorhexidine mouthwash; and group III: sesame oil. Baseline scores of plaque index (PI) and modified gingival index (GI) were recorded followed by a full mouth oral prophylaxis. The designated mouth rinses were distributed to the respective groups and they were instructed to rinse once daily. Their parents supervised the children during the use of mouthwash. On the 15th and 30th day, the children were subjected to the same clinical measurements. Children's acceptance of their plaque control method was assessed using a modified facial image scale. RESULTS: Intragroup comparisons for both the GI and PI scores were statistically significant (p ≤ 0.001) in all the three groups. Difference in the GI scores between the 15th and 30th day was statistically significant for chlorhexidine group alone (p = 0.024). Intergroup comparisons between the three groups were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Probiotic mouthwash, chlorhexidine mouthwash, and sesame oil were equally effective in reducing plaque and in improving the gingival status of children. The difference between the gingival scores on the 15th and 30th day was statistically significant in the chlorhexidine group.How to cite this article: Kandaswamy SK, Sharath A, Priya PRG.

      "abstract": "Dental diseases have detrimental effects on the functionality and quality of life of individuals. In addition, a strong relationship has been established between various oral and systemic diseases. In fact, the prevention and treatment of dental caries and periodontal disease have been shown to reduce the risk of diabetes and heart disease significantly. This goes beyond the role of oral health as a means to identify early manifestations of systemic diseases in the oral cavity. It highlights the necessity of maintaining an optimal oral hygiene to significantly modify the risk factors for serious systemic diseases. The use of oil pulling can be frequently found in ancient medical text and is supported by recent studies for its efficacy and long-term use for maintaining and improving oral health. This article provides an overview on the concept of oil pulling or oil swishing, its mechanism of action and a summary of the evidence available, which highlights the role of oil pulling in specific oral diseases. The goal of this review is to highlight the ancient procedure that has the potential to be used as an adjunct to conventional chemical means of dental plaque control, such as mouth rinses. Incorporating oil swishing as a component of daily oral hygiene can significantly improve oral and general health, specifically in lower socioeconomic groups and rural communities that may have interrupted access to health-care services and dental products such as dentifrices and mouth washes due to various factors; availability and affordability being the most important."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Rice bran oil, owing to its potential antioxidant benefits, could be an effective and novel alternative to sesame oil for oil pulling. As it is safe and a growingly popular edible oil, it may be acceptable during pregnancy, especially in the Indian context where women may be hesitant to use chemical plaque control methods for preventing halitosis. AIMS: The present study was conducted to compare the effects of oil pulling with rice bran oil, oil pulling with sesame oil, and oil pulling with chlorhexidine mouth rinsing on reducing halitosis among pregnant women. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Thirty pregnant women who attended the Gynecology Outpatient Department (OPD) of Muslim Medical Hospital, Haran Khana Road, Pani Gate, Vadodara, Gujarat, India, were recruited in the present randomized double-blind interventional study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eligible pregnant women individuals who gave consent for the study were randomly allocated to receive the interventions under investigation. Halitosis was measured at baseline and after 14 days of intervention using TANITA breath checker HC-212M-BL. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data entry was done in Microsoft Excel 2007, and statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 17. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to interpret the differences in baseline and postintervention halitosis levels. One-way ANOVA was done to compare the mean reduction in halitosis scores of the three intervention groups. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant reduction in the grades of halitosis at baseline and 14 days after intervention for all the three groups. There was no statistically significant difference between chlorhexidine mouth rinsing, oil pulling with sesame oil, and oil pulling with rice bran oil in halitosis reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Rice bran oil when used in oil pulling was effective in reducing halitosis. It performed comparably and marginally superior to other agents tested in the study when change in halitosis postintervention was considered.",

      "abstract": "AIM: To critically appraise and evaluate the evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining the effectiveness of oil pulling on oro dental hygiene. METHODS: We conducted electronic searches in Medline, Embase, Amed, The Cochrane Library and Cinahl databases from inception to February 2015, and assessed reporting quality using the Cochrane risk of bias criteria. We included RCTs that compared oil pulling using conventional cooking oils with a control intervention. Our primary outcomes were measures of oro dental hygiene using validated scales. RESULTS: Electronic searches yielded 26 eligible studies, of which five RCTs comprising a total of 160 participants were included. The studies varied in reporting quality, lasted between 10 and 45 days, and compared oil pulling with chlorhexidine, placebo or routine dental hygiene practice. Three studies reported no significant differences in post intervention plaque index scores between oil pulling and control groups (Chlorhexidine mouthwash +/- Placebo): p=0.28, 0.94, and 0.38, respectively. Two studies reported no significant difference in post-intervention modified gingival index score between oil pulling and Chlorhexidine mouthwash groups (p=0.32 and 0.64). CONCLUSION: The limited evidence to date from clinical trials suggests that oil pulling may have beneficial effects on oro dental hygiene as seen for the short period of time investigated. Given that this is a potentially cost-effective intervention, this practice might be of particular benefit. Future clinical trials should be more rigorous and better reported.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Oil pulling is an age-old practice that has gained modern popularity in promoting oral and systemic health. The scientific verification for this practice is insufficient. Thus, this study evaluated the effect of coconut oil pulling on the count of Streptococcus mutans in saliva and to compare its efficacy with that of Chlorhexidine mouthwash: in vivo. The null hypothesis was that coconut oil pulling has no effect on the bacterial count in saliva. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled study was planned and 60 subjects were selected. The subjects were divided into three groups, Group A: STUDY GROUP: Oil pulling, Group B: STUDY GROUP: Chlorhexidine, and Group C: CONTROL GROUP: Distilled water. Group A subjects rinsed mouth with 10 ml of coconut oil for 10 minutes. Group B subjects rinsed mouth with 5 ml Chlorhexidine mouthwash for 1 minute and Group C with 5 ml distilled water for 1 minute in the morning before brushing. Saliva samples were collected and cultured on 1st day and after 2 weeks from all subjects. Colonies were counted to compare the efficacy of coconut oil and Chlorhexidine with distilled water. RESULTS: Statistically significant reduction in S. mutans count was seen in both the coconut oil pulling and Chlorhexidine group. CONCLUSION: Oil pulling can be explored as a safe and effective alternative to Chlorhexidine. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Edible oil-pulling therapy is natural, safe and has no side effects. Hence, it can be considered as a preventive therapy at home to maintain oral hygiene.",

AIMS: To compare the efficacy of oil pulling and chlorhexidine in reducing oral malodor and microbes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three week randomized controlled trial was conducted among 60 students of three hostels of Maharani College of science and arts and commerce and Smt V.H.D.College of Home Science. The hostels were randomized into two intervention groups namely chlorhexidine group, sesame oil and one control (placebo) group. Twenty girls were selected from each hostel based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Informed consent was obtained. The parameters recorded at the baseline (day 0) and post intervention on day 22 were plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), objective (ORG1) and subjective (ORG2) organoleptic scores and anaerobic bacterial colony (ABC) count. Intra and inter group comparisons were made using Kruskal Wallis test, Wilcoxan sign rank test, ANOVA and student t-test. RESULTS: There was significant reduction (p<0.05) in the mean scores of all the parameters within sesame oil and chlorhexidine group. Among the groups significant difference was observed in objective and subjective organoleptic scores. Post hoc test showed significant difference (p<0.000) in mean organoleptic scores of sesame oil and placebo and chlorhexidine and placebo group. No significant difference (p<0.05) was observed between sesame oil and chlorhexidine group. CONCLUSION: Oil pulling with sesame oil is equally efficacious as chlorhexidine in reducing oral malodor and microbes causing it. It should be promoted as a preventive home care therapy."

AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of sesame oil and lignans isolated from sesame oil on oral microorganisms and to check whether saponification or emulsification occurs during oil-pulling therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in vitro study was carried out in three different phases: (1) Antibacterial activity of the lignans and sesame oil were tested by minimum inhibitory concentration assay by agar dilution method and agar well diffusion method, respectively. (2) Increase in free fatty acid level of oil and the quantity of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) used up in the titration are good indicators of saponification process. This was assessed using analytical tests for vegetable oils. (3) Swished oil was observed under light microscope to assess the status of the oil, presence of microorganisms, oral debris and foreign bodies. RESULTS: Sesamin and sesamolin isolated from sesame oil did not have any antibacterial effect against oral microorganisms like Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus viridans. Emulsification of sesame oil occurs during oil-pulling therapy. Increased consumption of NaOH in titration is a definite indication of a possible saponification process. CONCLUSION: The myth that the effect of oil-pulling therapy on oral health was just a placebo effect has been broken and there are clear indications of possible saponification and emulsification process, which enhances its mechanical cleaning action.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 20 age-matched adolescent boys with plaque-induced gingivitis were selected for this study. They were divided randomly into the study or oil pulling group (Group I) and the control or chlorhexidine group (Group II) with 10 subjects in each group. Plaque index and modified gingival index scores were recorded for the 20 subjects and baseline plaque samples were also collected. The plaque samples were used to identify the microorganisms and to measure the total colony count of the aerobic microorganisms present. The study group was subjected to oil pulling with sesame oil and the control group was given chlorhexidine mouthwash everyday in the morning before brushing. Reassessment of the index scores and collection of plaque for measuring the colony count of the aerobic microorganisms was done after 10 days. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant reduction of the pre- and post-values of the plaque and modified gingival index scores in both the study and control groups (P < 0.001 in both). There was a considerable reduction in the total colony count of aerobic microorganisms present in both the groups. CONCLUSION: The oil pulling therapy showed a reduction in the plaque index, modified gingival scores, and total colony count of aerobic microorganisms in the plaque of adolescents with plaque-induced gingivitis.",
