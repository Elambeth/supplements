      "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is a key factor in age-related cognitive decline and memory impairment. UAS03, a potent synthetic analogue of Urolithin-A, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This investigation examined the neuroprotective effect of UAS03 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced neuroinflammation, and its associated cognitive impairments, memory deficits, and depression-like behaviors. Intracerebroventricular administration of LPS (12 μg/kg) was performed to induce neuroinflammation in mice, followed by a 7 day treatment with UAS03 at 10 and 30 mg/kg doses. Mice were evaluated for depressive and anxiety-like behavior, spatial memory, and learning functions using a series of neurobehavioral test paradigms. Histopathological and molecular analyses were conducted using hematoxylin-eosin and cresyl violet staining, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and Western blotting techniques. We have found that, UAS03 significantly enhanced cognitive and memory functions impaired by LPS while concurrently reducing depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the compound attenuated neuronal damage and decreased the expression of IBA-1 and GFAP in hippocampal region. Through the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway, UAS03 effectively mitigated markers of oxidative stress and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory factors, including IL-1β, TNF-α, and COX-2. Cumulatively, this study provides compelling evidence that UAS03 exerts neuroprotective effects by regulating essential pathways involved in anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective mechanisms, suggesting its potential as a preventative measure against age-related cognitive decline and memory impairments associated with neuroinflammation."

      "abstract": "Urolithin A (UA), a metabolite of natural polyphenols produced by the gut microbiota, alleviates the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by inhibiting the inflammatory response. UA alleviates the clinical symptoms of RA by inhibiting the occurrence of an inflammatory response, but the specific regulatory mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we established a CIA model in 8-week-old DBA mice and chose LPS-stimulated NIH/3 T3 cells to explore the effects of UA and attempted to elucidate its potential mechanisms. Our results showed UA significantly reduced arthritis scores, and inhibited inflammation, pannus formation, and cartilage and bone destruction of inflamed joints in CIA mice. In vitro, UA inhibited LPS-induced migration and proliferation, and alleviated NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis, significantly inhibiting the protein expression levels of NLRP3, N-terminal gasdermin D, interleukin-1β, caspase-1, and ASC in NIH/3T3 cells. A mechanistic investigation revealed that LPS enhanced phosphorylation of NF-κB and downregulated that of AMPK, which were categorically counteracted by UA treatment. Therefore, UA represents a new class of promising RA treatments targeting fibroblasts, widening the therapeutic options for RA.",

      "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB), resulting from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide. Host-directed therapy (HDT) is a novel approach for treating TB, particularly those with drug resistance. Urolithin A (UroA) produced through bioconversion of plant-derived ellagic acid by gut microbes has been proven to have multiple beneficial effects in a variety of diseases without showing undesired adverse reactions. However, whether UroA has antimycobacterial effect and the underlying mechanism has not yet been reported. Here, we found that UroA significantly inhibited Mtb growth within both macrophages and mice. Moreover, UroA promoted the activation of autophagy in Mtb-infected macrophages via the protein kinase B-Forkhead box protein O1 signaling pathway, which contributed to the antimycobacterial effect of UroA. Additionally, UroA suppressed the survival of clinically isoniazid (INH)-resistant Mtb (C2) within macrophages, and the combination of UroA and INH synergistically enhanced host elimination of Mtb H37Rv. Therefore, UroA may be utilized as a potential candidate for HDT and as an adjunctive therapy with first-line anti-TB drugs.IMPORTANCEHost-directed therapy (HDT) is a novel approach for treating tuberculosis (TB), particularly those with drug resistance.

      "abstract": "Ellagic acid (EA) exhibits protective effects on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the ability to produce urolithins and the health benefits associated with EA consumption differ considerably among individuals. Therefore, the different effects of EA on high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD)-induced NAFLD, considering variability in urolithin-producing ability, were explored. Our results showed that EA could effectively reduce body weight, lipid accumulation and insulin resistance, and improve oxidative stress and inflammation in NAFLD mice. The metabolomics analysis indicated that liver metabolism disorder induced by HFFD was obviously improved by EA mainly through the regulation of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and amino acid metabolism. In particular, the improvement effect of EA on NAFLD in mice with high urolithin A production was better than that in their low counterparts. Moreover, EA treatment reshaped the gut microbiota imbalance caused by HFFD. Specifically, compared to the model group, the lower abundances of Faecalibaculum (by 95.11%), Ruminococcus_torques_group (by 208.14%), Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 (by 449.37%), and Ileibacterium (by 172.64%), while higher abundances of Verrucomicrobia and Akkermansia (by 425.0%) were observed in the high-UroA-producing group (p < 0.05). This study provided new insights into EA's anti-NAFLD effectiveness and suggested that the response capacity of the gut microbiota to EA greatly determined the performance of EA in alleviating the development of NAFLD.",

      "abstract": "Constant tumor antigen exposure disrupts chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell metabolism, limiting their persistence and anti-tumor efficacy. To address this, we develop metabolically reprogrammed CAR (MCAR) T cells with enhanced autophagy and mitophagy. A compound screening identifies a synergy between GLP-1R agonist (semaglutide [SG]) and Urolithin A (UrA), which activate autophagy through mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibition and mitophagy via Atg4b activation, maintaining mitochondrial metabolism in CAR T cells (MCAR T-1). These changes increase CD8+ T memory cells (Tm), enhancing persistence and anti-tumor activity in vitro and in xenograft models. GLP-1R knockdown in CAR T cells diminishes autophagy/mitophagy induction, confirming its critical role. We further engineer GLP-1-secreting cells (MCAR T-2), which exhibited sustained memory, stemness, and long-term persistence, even under tumor re-challenge. MCAR T-2 cells also reduce cytokine release syndrome (CRS) risks while demonstrating potent anti-tumor effects. This strategy highlights the potential of metabolic reprogramming via targeting autophagy/mitophagy pathways to improve CAR T cell therapy outcomes, ensuring durability and efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the primary cause of global mortality. Nutritional interventions hold promise to reduce CVD risks in an increasingly aging population. However, few nutritional interventions are proven to support heart health and act mostly on blood lipid homeostasis rather than at cardiac cell level. Here, we show that mitochondrial quality dysfunctions are common hallmarks in human cardiomyocytes upon heart aging and in chronic conditions. Preclinically, the post-biotic and mitophagy activator, urolithin A (UA), reduced both systolic and diastolic cardiac dysfunction in models of natural aging and heart failure. At a cellular level, this was associated with a recovery of mitochondrial ultrastructural defects and mitophagy. In humans, UA supplementation for 4 months in healthy older adults significantly reduced plasma ceramides clinically validated to predict CVD risks. These findings extend and translate UA's benefits to heart health, making UA a promising nutritional intervention to support cardiovascular function as we age."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota-derived urolithins may influence multiple myeloma (MM) disease progression and treatment. We analyzed urolithins and their associated microbiota in a retrospective cohort of 45 patients with active MM or premalignant disease using mass spectrometry and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: Patients with detectable levels of urolithin in serum and stool and a higher abundance of urolithin-related microbiota had a better outcome. Analysis of the effects of urolithin A (UroA) treatment ex vivo, in vitro, and in vivo revealed that UroA is cytotoxic against MM cell lines and modulates the cell cycle and mitochondrial activity. Notably, UroA inhibits the proliferation of primary MM cells in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model, improving overall survival. Finally, combination therapy with UroA and bortezomib has a synergistic effect in vitro, even in the presence of bortezomib resistance, and modulates signaling pathways involved in MM development. CONCLUSIONS: UroA might be a potential therapeutic agent to halt MM disease progression or to overcome resistance when used in combination. Video Abstract.",

      "abstract": "The management of cognitive impairments in schizophrenia presents a considerable challenge, with a strong association between neuroinflammation and its progression. Urolithin A (UA) demonstrates important anti-inflammatory properties in multiple neurological disease models, contributing to the enhancement of cognitive deficits. However, it remains uncertain if UA can produce comparable neuroregulatory effects in female rat models of schizophrenia. Eight-week-old female Sprague Dawley rats received either 0.1 mg/kg of MK801 or volume-matched saline via intraperitoneal injection for 5 consecutive days. Furthermore, they were administered 150 mg/kg of UA through oral gavage for 4 weeks. Behavioral assessments were performed to evaluate cognitive function and behavior after UA treatment. Immunofluorescence staining was employed to assess microglial activity in the hippocampus, while Western blot analysis was conducted to investigate the expression of neuroinflammation-associated proteins. Prolonged exposure to MK801 induces schizophrenia-like behaviors and cognitive deficits in female rats. It also elevates the expression of NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18 proteins in the hippocampus, accompanied by the activation of microglial cells. However, UA treatment can reverse the expression of these inflammatory proteins and the activation of microglial cells induced by MK801. This is the first study to evaluate the effects of UA on behavior and cognition in a female rat model of schizophrenia. The findings indicate that UA mitigates MK-801-induced cognitive deficits in female rats by inhibiting neuroinflammation and microglial activation via modulation of the NLRP3 signaling pathway. These findings offer preclinical data endorsing the possible application of UA as a dietary supplement to prevent cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",

Urolithin A (UA), a gut-derived metabolite of ellagitannins, has shown promise for improving muscle function and metabolic health in rodent models. This study aimed to explore the impact of UA on insulin and anabolic sensitivity in human skeletal muscle cells. METHODS: Primary human myogenic cultures were derived from skeletal muscle biopsies of eight healthy adults. After differentiation, myotubes were treated with 0.002, 1 and 50 µM UA or vehicle for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed using a resazurin assay. Basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was measured using tritiated deoxy-D-glucose, whilst amino acid-stimulated protein synthesis was estimated using the surface sensing of translation (SuNSET) technique. Expression of myostatin and glucose transporters was quantified via real-time PCR. RESULTS: UA treatment at ≤ 50 µM did not compromise cell viability. Treatment with 50 µM UA enhanced both basal- and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by 21% (P < 0.05) and 24% (P < 0.01), respectively, compared to vehicle and was accompanied by a 1.8-fold upregulation of GLUT4 expression (P < 0.01). 50 µM UA reduced myostatin (MSTN) expression by 14% (P < 0.01) but did not alter amino acid-stimulated global cell protein synthesis. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of UA's metabolic benefits in primary human myotubes, notably improving basal- and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and supressing MSTN expression. These findings suggest UA could be an effective nutraceutical for mitigating insulin resistance and warrants further investigation."

      "abstract": "In the past decade, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has become pivotal in clinical diagnosis, drug discovery, and bioanalytical science due to its high sensitivity and rapid analysis. We have developed an ultrasensitive and robust LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous detection and quantification of cyclosporine A (CsA) and urolithin A (UA) employing ascomycin (ASC) and naringenin (NAR) as internal standards (ISTDs). The method was validated for clinical use, revealing interspecies differences between human plasma and other mammals (e.g., mouse, rat, feline, canine, and bovine serum). Validation parameters, including accuracy, precision, limits of quantification, specificity, selectivity, carryover, linearity, stability, and recovery, met acceptable ICH standards. Linear regression across the full calibration range (1-250 ng/mL for CsA and 0.5-125 ng/mL for UA) yielded an average R2 ≥ 0.999 in all mammal models. The method achieved a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1-2.5 ng/mL across all model plasma samples with negligible carryover and demonstrated sample stability up to 96 h intra- and interday and 48 h for bovine serum. The method was successfully applied to quantify CsA and UA in canine samples following oral administration from a previous study. With a rapid run time of 6 min, this method offers high selectivity and precision, making it ideal for analyzing limited sample sizes and addressing regulatory challenges. The ability to simultaneously quantify CsA and UA has significant clinical potential for managing complex immuno-inflammatory diseases, enabling precise dose adjustments, and optimizing treatment outcomes."

      "abstract": "Urolithin A (URA), a product of the gut microflora from foods rich in ellagitannins found in berries and nuts, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antioxidative stress properties in various disease models. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death, is considered a pathogenic cause of tendinopathy. However, the effects of URA on hyperlipidemic tenocytes and the related molecular mechanisms for the treatment of tendinopathy have not been elucidated. The expression of various proteins in human primary tenocytes was assessed via Western blot analysis. Tenocyte reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected via DCFDA staining. Apoptotic tenocytes were visualized via TUNEL staining. The activities of antioxidant enzymes and caspase 3 were measured via activity assays. Cell viability was examined via the MTT assay. In this study, we found that URA treatment blocked ferroptosis and apoptosis and improved oxidative stress in palmitate-treated tenocytes. Moreover, URA treatment reversed the changes in the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) markers and impaired cell migration. siRNA targeting PPARδ or ALDH2 abrogated the effects of URA on tenocytes treated with palmitate. Additionally, treatment of tenocytes with URA increased SOD and catalase activities. These results suggest that URA ameliorates tenocyte ferroptosis and apoptosis through PPARδ/ALDH2 signaling-mediated suppression of oxidative stress. By utilizing natural bioactive compounds derived from renewable dietary sources, this study highlights a potential therapeutic avenue for treating obesity-related tendinopathy while emphasizing the importance of sustainable, health-promoting interventions.",

      "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a potentially fatal condition that often results in loss of motor and sensory functions, thereby significantly burdening global health initiatives. Urolithin A (UA), an intestinal microbial metabolite of ellagic acid, is known for its potent anti-inflammatory properties in chronic inflammation contexts. UA treatment in humans induces a molecular signature of improved mitochondrial and cellular health. Yet, its effects on acute inflammation following SCI remain unclear. In this study, we developed an impact-induced mouse model for SCI and treated the injured mice with UA (50 mg/kg/d, till 8 weeks) via intragastric administration. Furthermore, we subjected BV2 cells to lipopolysaccharide and adenosine 5'-triphosphate to simulate the post-injury inflammatory response. Our results demonstrated that pre-treatment with UA (10 μM) effectively inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in LPS-primed BV2 cells. This inhibition was evidenced by reduced cleaved Caspase-1 and mature IL-1β release, diminished ASC speck formation, and decreased gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis. Additionally, UA treatment restored mitochondrial activity and ROS production attenuated by NLRP3 activation, increased LC3-II expression, and enhanced LC3 co-localization with mitochondria. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA), an autophagy inhibitor, can partially reverse the stimulatory effect of UA on mitophagy, as well as the inhibitory effect of UA on pyroptosis. This study highlighted the protective role of UA against SCI through its promotion of mitophagy, which in turn inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis.",

      "abstract": "Doxorubicin (Dox) is a widely used antineoplastics although its clinical usage is greatly limited by its cardiotoxicity. Several studies have depicted an essential role for dampened mitophagy and mitochondrial injury in Dox cardiotoxicity. However, preventative measure to alleviate Dox-evoked cardiotoxicity via targeting mitophagy and mitochondrial integrity remains elusive. Urolithin A (UA) is a newly identified mitophagy inducer with antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties although its effect on Dox-induced cardiotoxicity is unknown. This study was designed to explore the effect of UA on Dox cardiotoxicity and mechanisms involved. Our results indicated that UA alleviated Dox-induced cardiac dysfunction exhibited by echocardiographic parameters and histological analyses, and partially relieved Dox-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, and mitochondrial dysfunction including ΔΨm dissipation and ROS production in vitro. The ability of UA to facilitate restoration of mitophagy in mice and H9C2s underscored its advantageous effects, manifested as upregulation of mitophagy-related proteins, including p62, LC3, PINK1 and Parkin, as well as the co-location between LC3 and mitochondria. Incubation with 3 -MA nearly reversed the UA-evoked rise of mitophagy-related proteins, and inhibition of apoptosis. Given that knockdown of Ambra1 almost abolished UA-induced protective effect, the enhanced expression of Ambra1 owing to UA increased PINK1 levels by inhibiting its degradation via LONP1. Collectively, our results suggest that the cardioprotective properties of UA depend on the stimulation of PINK1-dependent mitophagy through promoting Ambra1 expression to inhibit PINK1 degradation by LONP1. This highlights UA's potential as a valuable treatment option and its importance in cardioprotective strategies against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "Efficient signal transduction that mediates mitochondrial turnover is a strong determinant of metabolic health in skeletal muscle. Of these pathways, our focus was aimed towards the enhancement of antioxidant capacity, mitophagy, and mitochondrial biogenesis. While physical activity is an excellent inducer of mitochondrial turnover, its ability to ubiquitously activate and enhance mitochondrial turnover prevents definitive differentiation of the contribution made by each pathway. Therefore, we employed three agents, Sulforaphane (SFN), Urolithin A (UroA), and ZLN005 (ZLN), which are activators of important biological markers involved in antioxidant signaling, mitophagy, and biogenesis, respectively. We investigated the time-dependent changes in proteins related to each mechanism in C2C12 myotubes. SFN treatment resulted in increased nuclear localization of the transcription factor Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf-2) after 4 ​hour (h), with subsequent 2-fold increases in the antioxidant enzymes Nicotinamide Quinone Oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and Heme-Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) by 24 ​h and 48 ​h. Mitochondrial respiration and ATP production were significantly increased by both 24 h and 48 ​h. UroA showed a 2-fold increase in AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) after 4 ​h, which led to a modest 30% increase in whole cell mitophagy markers p62 and LC3, after 48 ​h. This was accompanied by a reduction in cellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), detected with the CellROX Green reagent. Mitophagy flux measurements showed mitophagy activation as both LC3-II and p62 flux increased with UroA at 24-h and 48-h time points, respectively. Finally, AMPK activation was observed by 4 ​h, in addition to a 2-fold increase in Mitochondrial Transcription Factor A (TFAM) promoter activity by 24 ​h of ZLN treatment following transient transfection of a TFAM promoter-luciferase construct. Mitochondrial respiration and ATP production were enhanced by 24 ​h. Our results suggest that early time points of treatment increase upstream pathway activity, whereas later time points represent the increased phenotypic expression of related downstream markers. Our findings suggest that the spatiotemporal progression of these mechanisms following drug treatment is another important factor to consider when examining subcellular changes towards mitochondrial turnover in muscle."

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment often involves systemic administration of anti-inflammatory drugs or biologics such as anti-TNF-α antibodies. However, current drug therapies suffer from limited efficacy due to unresponsiveness and adverse side effects. To address these challenges, we developed inflammation-targeting nanoparticles (ITNPs) using biopolymers derived from the gum kondagogu (Cochlospermum gossypium) plant. These ITNPs enable selective drug delivery to inflamed regions, offering improved therapeutic outcomes. We designed ITNPs that specifically bind to inflamed regions in both human and mouse intestines, facilitating more effective, uniform, and prolonged drug delivery within the inflamed tissues. Furthermore, we demonstrated that oral administration of ITNPs loaded with urolithin A (UroA), a microbial metabolite or its synthetic analogue UAS03 significantly attenuated chemical- and immune checkpoint inhibitor- induced colitis in pre-clinical models. In conclusion, ITNPs show great promise for delivering UroA or its analogues while enhancing therapeutic efficacy at lower doses and reduced frequency compared to free drug administration. This targeted approach offers a potential solution to enhance IBD treatment while minimizing systemic side effects.",

Ferroptosis represents a novel form of cell death that is intimately linked to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MIR) injury. Urolithin A (UA), an intestinal metabolite of ellagitannins, has not been fully elucidated for its role in MIR injury. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of UA on ischemia-reperfusion-induced oxidative stress and ferroptosis both in vitro and in vivo, and explored the potential mechanisms of UA action. The results indicated that UA was capable of protecting the heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury and enhancing cardiac function both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, UA also attenuated oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, and ferroptosis during MIR. Mechanistically, UA not only augmented the Nrf2 expression but also promoted Nrf2 entry into the nucleus and activated the downstream antioxidant defense system. Moreover, after the inhibition of Nrf2, the myocardial protective function of UA was lost, and its function of attenuating oxidative stress and ferroptosis was suppressed. In conclusion, we found that UA protected the heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury by attenuating oxidative stress and ferroptosis through the Nrf2 signaling pathway, suggesting that UA might be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of AMI.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) poses major diagnoses. Urolithin A (UA) is a natural compound produced by the gut microbiota through the metabolism of polyphenol ellagitannins (ETs) and ellagic acid (EA), which has been found to inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung cancer cell lines. However, the mechanism of UA function in NSCLC remains elusive. PROPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the potential effectiveness of UA in NSCLC therapeutic and uncovering its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Effects of UA treatment, TMSB10 gene knockdown or overexpression on NSCLC cell phenotype were evaluated by availability, transwell assays. The downstream factors and pathways of UA were investigated by proteomics. TMSB10 expression in NSCLC tissues was detected by bioinformatics analysis as well as immunohistochemistry. Confocal imaging, GST pull-down and western blotting investigated the mechanism of UA induced TMSB10 degradation. RESULTS: In the present study, we demonstrated that UA shows an inhibitory role in NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This inhibition is attributed to the accelerated degradation of TMSB10, a biomarker among various cancers, via the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Additionally, knocked down of TMSB10 showed a similar phenotype with UA treatment. The reduction of TMSB10 protein level following decreased ATP level inhibits the F-actin formation for cell migration, thereby disrupting the equilibrium between G-actin-TMSB10 and G-actin-ATP interactions in A549 cells. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal that UA is potential for NSCLC therapeutics through reducing the protein level of TMSB10 to deformation the F-actin.",

      "abstract": "Increased activity of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) is a key factor mediating kidney impairment in diabetes. Glomerular podocytes, the crucial component of the renal filter, are a direct target of TGF-β action, resulting in irreversible cell loss and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Urolithin A (UA) is a member of the family of polyphenol metabolites produced by gut microbiota from ellagitannins and ellagic acid-rich foods. The broad spectrum of biological activities of UA makes it a promising candidate for the treatment of podocyte disorders. In this in vitro study, we investigated whether UA influences the changes exerted in podocytes by TGF-β and high glucose. Following a 7-day incubation in normal (NG, 5.5 mM) or high (HG, 25 mM) glucose, the cells were treated with UA and/or TGF-β1 for 24 h. HG and TGF-β1, each independent and in concert reduced expression of nephrin, increased podocyte motility, and up-regulated expression of b3 integrin and fibronectin. These typical-for-epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) effects were inhibited by UA in both HG and NG conditions. UA also reduced the typically elevated HG expression of TGF-β receptors and activation of the TGF-β signal transducer Smad2. Our results indicate that in podocytes cultured in conditions mimicking the diabetic milieu, UA inhibits and reverses changes underlying podocytopenia in diabetic kidneys. Hence, UA should be considered as a potential therapeutic agent in podocytopathies."

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of copper (Cu) exposure on progression of ALS and explore the therapeutic effect and mechanism of Urolithin A (UA) on ALS. 0.13 PPM copper chloride drinking water was administrated in SOD1G93A transgenic mice at 6 weeks, UA at a dosage of 50 mg/kg/day was given for 6 weeks after a 7-week Cu exposure. Motor ability was assessed before terminal anesthesia. Muscle atrophy and fibrosis, motor neurons, astrocytes and microglia in the spinal cord were evaluated by H&E, Masson, Sirius Red, Nissl and Immunohistochemistry Staining. Proteomics analysis, Western blotting and ELISA were conducted to detect protein expression. Mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured using an assay kit. Cu-exposure worsened motor function, promoted muscle fibrosis, loss of motor neurons, and astrocyte and microglial activation. It also induced abnormal changes in mitochondria-related biological processes, leading to a significant reduction in ATP levels and an increase in MDA levels. Upregulation of P62 and downregulation of Parkin, PINK1, and LAMP1 were revealed in SOD1G93A mice with Cu exposure. Administration of UA activated mitophagy, modulated mitochondria dysfunction, reduced neuroinflammation, and improved gastrocnemius muscle atrophy and motor dysfunction in SOD1G93A mice with Cu exposure. Mitophagy plays critical role in ALS exacerbated by Cu exposure. UA administration may be a promising treatment strategy for ALS."

Computational toxicology analysis predicted the correlation between protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and genes regarding Cr(VI)-induced intestinal injury. Here, we generated a mouse model with intestinal epithelium-specific knock out of Ppp2r1a (encoding PP2A Aα subunit) to investigate the mechanisms underlying Cr(VI)-induced small intestinal toxicity. Heterozygous (HE) mice and matched WT littermates were administrated with Cr(VI) at 0, 5, 20, and 80 mg/l for 28 successive days. Cr(VI) treatment led to crypt hyperplasia, epithelial cell apoptosis, and intestinal barrier dysfunction, accompanied by the decline of goblet cell counts and Occludin expression in WT mice. Notably, these effects were aggravated in HE mice, indicating that PP2A Aα deficiency conferred mice with susceptibility to Cr(VI)-induced intestinal injury. The combination of data analysis and biological experiments revealed Cr(VI) exposure could decrease YAP1 phosphorylation at Ser127 but increase protein expression and activity, together with elevated transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif protein driving epithelial crypt cells proliferation following damage, suggesting the involvement of Hippo/YAP1 signaling pathway in Cr(VI)-induced intestinal toxicity. Nevertheless, the enhanced phosphorylation of YAP1 in HE mice resulted in proliferation/repair defects in intestinal epithelium, thereby exacerbating Cr(VI)-induced gut barrier dysfunction. Notably, by molecular docking and further studies, we identified urolithin A, a microbial metabolite, attenuated Cr(VI)-induced disruption of intestinal barrier function, partly by modulating YAP1 expression and activity. Our findings reveal the novel molecular pathways participated in Cr(VI)-caused small intestinal injury and urolithin A could potentially protect against environmental hazards-induced intestinal diseases.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies confirmed that pyroptosis is involved in the progression of pulmonary hypertension (PH), which could promote pulmonary artery remodeling. Urolithin A (UA), an intestinal flora metabolite of ellagitannins (ETs) and ellagic acid (EA), has been proven to possess inhibitory effects on pyroptosis under various pathological conditions. However, its role on PH remained undetermined. To investigate the potential of UA in mitigating PH, mice were exposed to hypoxia (10% oxygen, 4 weeks) to induce PH, with or without UA treatment. Moreover, in vitro experiments were carried out to further uncover the underlying mechanisms. The in vivo treatment of UA suppressed the progression of PH via alleviating pulmonary remodeling. Pyroptosis-related genes were markedly upregulated in mice models of PH and reversed after the administration of UA. In accordance with that, UA treatment significantly inhibited hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) pyroptosis via the AMPK/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway. Our results revealed that UA treatment effectively mitigated PH progression through inhibiting PASMC pyroptosis, which represents an innovative therapeutic approach for PH.",

Circadian rhythm dysregulation was reported to induce intestinal microbiota dysbiosis, intestinal barrier disruption, and trigger intestinal inflammation. However, the relationship between intestinal microbiota metabolites and the circadian rhythm of the intestinal barrier was still unclear. Urolithin A (UA), a kind of intestinal microbial metabolite, was selected in this study. Results showed UA influenced on the expression rhythm of the clock genes BMAL1 and PER2 in intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, the study investigated the effects of UA on the expression rhythms of clock genes (BMAL1 and PER2) and tight junctions (OCLN, TJP1, and CLND1), all of which were dysregulated by inflammation. In addition, UA pre-treatment by oral administration to female C57BL/6 mice showed the improvement in the fecal IgA concentrations, tight junction expression (Clnd1 and Clnd4), and clock gene expression (Bmal1 and Per2) in a DSS-induced colitis model induced using DSS treatment. Finally, the Nrf2-SIRT1 signaling pathway was confirmed to be involved in UA's effect on the circadian rhythm of intestinal epithelial cells by antagonist treatment. This study also showed evidence that UA feeding showed an impact on the central clock, which are circadian rhythms in SCN. Therefore, this study highlighted the potential of UA in treating diseases like IBD with sleeping disorders by improving the dysregulated circadian rhythms in both the intestinal barrier and the SCN.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic effects of urolithin A (UA) on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced lung infection in neonatal mice and explore the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Babl/c mice (5-7 days old) were subjected to nasal instillation of RSV and received intraperitoneal injection of saline or 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg UA 2 h after the infection and then once daily for 2 weeks. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was then collected for detection of inflammatory cells and mediators, and lung pathology was evaluated with HE staining. RSV-infected BEAS-2B cells were treated with 2.5, 5 or 10 µmol/ L UA. Inflammatory factors, cell viability, apoptosis and autophagy were analyzed using ELISA, CCK-8 assay, TUNEL staining, flow cytometry, Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. The cellular expressions of miR-136 and Sirt1 mRNAs were detected using qRT-PCR. A dual-luciferase reporter system was used to verify the binding between miR-136 and Sirt1. RESULTS: In neonatal Babl/c mice, RSV infection caused obvious lung pathologies, promoted pulmonary cell apoptosis and LC3-Ⅱ/Ⅰ, Beclin-1 and miR-136 expressions, and increased the total cell number, inflammatory cells and factors in the BALF and decreased p62 and Sirt1 expressions. All these changes were alleviated dose-dependently by UA. In BEAS-2B cells, RSV infection significantly increased cell apoptosis, LC3B-positive cells and miR-136 expression and reduced Sirt1 expression (P<0.01), which were dose-dependently attenuated by UA. Dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed the binding between miR-136 and Sirt1. In RSV-infected BEAS-2B cells with UA treatment, overexpression of miR-136 and Ex527 treatment both significantly increased the inflammatory factors and cell apoptosis but decreased LC3B expression, and these changes were further enhanced by their combined treatment. CONCLUSION: UA ameliorates RSV-induced lung infection in neonatal mice by activating miR-136-mediated Sirt1 signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cirrhotic portal hypertension (CPH) is the leading cause of mortality in patients with cirrhosis. Over 50% of patients with CPH treated with current clinical pharmacotherapy still present variceal bleeding or sometimes death owing to insufficient reduction in portal pressure. Elevated intrahepatic vascular resistance (IHVR) plays a fundamental role in increasing portal pressure. Because of its potent effect in reducing portal pressure and maintaining normal portal inflow to preserve liver function, lowering the IHVR is acknowledged as an optimal anti-CPH strategy but without clinical drugs. We aimed to investigate the protective effect of microbial-derived Urolithin A (UroA) in IHVR and CPH. METHODS: Carbon tetrachloride or bile duct ligation surgery was administered to mice to induce liver fibrosis and CPH. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used for microbial analysis. Transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses were employed to study the host and cell responses. RESULTS: UroA was remarkably deficient in patients with CPH and was negatively correlated with disease severity. UroA deficiency was also confirmed in CPH mice and was associated with a reduced abundance of UroA-producing bacterial strain (Lactobacillus murinus, L. murinus). Glutaminolysis of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) was identified as a previously unrecognized target of UroA. UroA inhibited the activity of glutaminase1 to suppress glutaminolysis, which counteracted fibrogenesis and contraction of HSCs and ameliorated CPH by relieving IHVR. Supplementation with UroA or L. murinus effectively ameliorated CPH in mice. CONCLUSIONS: We for the first time identify the deficiency of gut microbial metabolite UroA as an important cause of CPH. We demonstrate that UroA exerts an excellent anti-CPH effect by suppressing HSC glutaminolysis to lower the IHVR, which highlighted its great potential as a novel therapeutic agent for CPH.",

Urolithin A (Uro A) is a gut microbiota-derived metabolite; however, its effect on mucin production as a physical barrier remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the protective effects of Uro A on mucin production in the colon. In vivo experiments employing wild-type mice, NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-deficient mice, and wild-type mice treated with an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) antagonist were conducted to investigate the physiological role of Uro A. Additionally, in vitro assays using mucin-producing cells (LS174T) were conducted to assess mucus production following Uro A treatment. We found that Uro A thickened murine colonic mucus via enhanced mucin 2 expression facilitated by Nrf2 and AhR signaling without altering tight junctions. Uro A reduced mucosal permeability in fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran experiments and alleviated dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Uro A treatment increased short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria and propionic acid concentration. LS174T cell studies confirmed that Uro A promotes mucus production through the AhR and Nrf2 pathways. In conclusion, the enhanced intestinal mucus secretion induced by Uro A is mediated through the actions of Nrf-2 and AhR, which help maintain intestinal barrier function.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in elderly people in the developed world, and the number of people affected is expected to almost double by 2040. The retina presents one of the highest metabolic demands in our bodies that is partially or fully fulfilled by mitochondria in the neuroretina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), respectively. Together with its post-mitotic status and constant photooxidative damage from incoming light, the retina requires a tightly-regulated housekeeping system that involves autophagy. The natural polyphenol Urolithin A (UA) has shown neuroprotective benefits in several models of aging and age-associated disorders, mostly attributed to its ability to induce mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. Sodium iodate (SI) administration recapitulates the late stages of AMD, including geographic atrophy and photoreceptor cell death. METHODS: A combination of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models were used to test the neuroprotective potential of UA in the SI model. Functional assays (OCT, ERGs), cellular analysis (flow cytometry, qPCR) and fine confocal microscopy (immunohistochemistry, tandem selective autophagy reporters) helped address this question. RESULTS: UA alleviated neurodegeneration and preserved visual function in SI-treated mice. Simultaneously, we observed severe proteostasis defects upon SI damage induction, including autophagosome accumulation, that were resolved in animals that received UA. Treatment with UA restored autophagic flux and triggered PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy, as previously reported in the literature. Autophagy blockage caused by SI was caused by severe lysosomal membrane permeabilization. While UA did not induce lysosomal biogenesis, it did restore upcycling of permeabilized lysosomes through lysophagy. Knockdown of the lysophagy adaptor SQSTM1/p62 abrogated viability rescue by UA in SI-treated cells, exacerbated lysosomal defects and inhibited lysophagy. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data highlight a novel putative application of UA in the treatment of AMD whereby it bypasses lysosomal defects by promoting p62-dependent lysophagy to sustain proteostasis.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is recognized as a global health crisis, contributing to approximately 20% of liver cancer-associated fatalities. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is associated with the development of ALD, with the gut microbial metabolite urolithin A (UA) exhibiting a potential for alleviating liver symptoms. However, the protective efficacy of UA against ALD and its underlying mechanism mediated by microbiota remain elusive. In this study, we provide evidence demonstrating that UA effectively ameliorates alcohol-induced metabolic disorders and hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through a specific gut-microbiota-liver axis mediated by major urinary protein 1 (MUP1). Moreover, UA exhibited the potential to restore alcohol-induced dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota by enriching the abundance of Bacteroides sartorii (B. sartorii), Parabacteroides distasonis (P. distasonis), and Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), along with their derived metabolite propionic acid. Partial attenuation of the hepatoprotective effects exerted by UA was observed upon depletion of gut microbiota using antibiotics. Subsequently, a fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiment was conducted to evaluate the microbiota-dependent effects of UA in ALD. FMT derived from mice treated with UA exhibited comparable efficacy to direct UA treatment, as it effectively attenuated ER stress through modulation of MUP1. It was noteworthy that strong associations were observed among the hepatic MUP1, gut microbiome, and metabolome profiles affected by UA. Intriguingly, oral administration of UA-enriched B. sartorii, P. distasonis, and A. muciniphila can enhance propionic acid production to effectively suppress ER stress via MUP1, mimicking UA treatment. Collectively, these findings elucidate the causal mechanism that UA alleviated ALD through the gut-microbiota-liver axis. This unique mechanism sheds light on developing novel microbiome-targeted therapeutic strategies against ALD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most prevalent malignancy in the world with an alarming rate of mortality. Despite the advancement in treatment strategies and drug developments, the overall survival rate remains poor. Therefore, it is imperative to develop alternative or complimentary anti cancer drugs with minimum off target effects. Urolithin A, a microbial metabolite of ellagic acid and ellagitannins produced endogenously by human gut micro biome is considered to have anti-cancerous activity. However anti tumorigenic effect of urolithin A in OSCC is yet to be elucidated. In this study, we examined whether urolithin A inhibits cell growth and induces both apoptosis and autophagy dependent cell death in OSCC cell lines. PURPOSE: The present study aims to evaluate the potential of urolithin A to inhibit OSCC and its regulatory effect on OSCC proliferation and invasion in vitro and in vivo mouse models. METHODS: We evaluated whether urolithin A could induce cell death in OSCC in vitro and in vivo mouse models. RESULTS: Flow cytometric and immunoblot analysis on Urolithin A treated OSCC cell lines revealed that urolithin A markedly induced cell death of OSCC via the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and subsequent inhibition of AKT and mTOR signaling as evidenced by decreased levels of phosphorylated mTOR and 4EBP1. This further revealed a possible cross talk between apoptotic and autophagic signaling pathways. In vivo study demonstrated that urolithin A treatment reduced tumor size and showed a decrease in mTOR, ERK1/2 and Akt levels along with a decrease in proliferation marker, Ki67. Taken together, in vitro as well as our in vivo data indicates that urolithin A is a potential anticancer agent and the inhibition of AKT/mTOR/ERK signalling is crucial in Urolithin A induced growth suppression in oral cancer. CONCLUSION: Urolithin A exerts its anti tumorigenic activity through the induction of apoptotic and autophagy pathways in OSCC. Our findings suggest that urolithin A markedly induced cell death of oral squamous cell carcinoma via the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and subsequent inhibition of AKT and mTOR signaling as evidenced by decreased levels of phosphorylated mTOR and 4EBP1. Urolithin A remarkably suppressed tumor growth in both in vitro and in vivo mouse models signifying its potential as an anticancer agent in the prevention and treatment of OSCC. Henceforth, our findings provide a new insight into the therapeutic potential of urolithin A in the prevention and treatment of OSCC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anxiety and social withdrawal are highly prevalent among patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the neural circuit mechanisms underlying these symptoms remain elusive, and there is a need for effective prevention strategies. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to elucidate the neural circuitry mechanisms underlying social anxiety in AD. METHODS: We utilized 5xFAD mice and conducted a series of experiments including optogenetic manipulation, Tandem Mass Tag-labeled proteome analysis, behavioral assessments, and immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: In 5xFAD mice, we observed significant amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in the anterior part of basolateral amygdala (aBLA). Behaviorally, 6-month-old 5xFAD mice displayed excessive social avoidance during social interaction. Concurrently, the pathway from aBLA to ventral hippocampal CA1 (vCA1) was significantly activated and exhibited a disorganized firing patterns during social interaction. By optogenetically inhibiting the aBLA-vCA1 pathway, we effectively improved the social ability of 5xFAD mice. In the presence of Aβ accumulation, we identified distinct changes in the protein network within the aBLA. Following one month of administration of Urolithin A (UA), we observed significant restoration of the abnormal protein network within the aBLA. UA treatment also attenuated the disorganized firings of the aBLA-vCA1 pathway, leading to an improvement in social ability. CONCLUSIONS: The aBLA-vCA1 circuit is a vulnerable pathway in response to Aβ accumulation during the progression of AD and plays a crucial role in Aβ-induced social anxiety. Targeting the aBLA-vCA1 circuit and UA administration are both effective strategies for improving the Aβ-impaired social ability.",

      "abstract": "Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), characterized by pancreatic acinar cell death, currently lacks effective targeted therapies. Ellagic acid (EA), rich in pomegranate, shows promising anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in SAP treatment. However, the roles of other forms of EA, such as plant extracellular vesicles (EVs) extracted from pomegranate, and Urolithin A (UA), converted from EA through gut microbiota metabolism in vivo, have not been definitively elucidated. Our research aimed to compare the effects of pomegranate-derived EVs (P-EVs) and UA in the treatment of SAP to screen an effective formulation and to explore its mechanisms in protecting acinar cells in SAP. By comparing the protective effects of P-EVs and UA on injured acinar cells, UA showed superior therapeutic effects than P-EVs. Subsequently, we further discussed the mechanism of UA in alleviating SAP inflammation. In vivo animal experiments found that UA could not only improve the inflammatory environment of pancreatic tissue and peripheral blood circulation in SAP mice but also revealed that the mechanism of UA in improving SAP might be related to mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the results including pancreatic tissue transcriptomics and transmission electron microscopy. Further research found that UA could regulate ER-mitochondrial calcium channels and reduce pancreatic tissue necroptosis. In vitro experiments of mouse pancreatic organoids and acinar cells also confirmed that UA could improve pancreatic inflammation by regulating the ER-mitochondrial calcium channel and necroptosis pathway proteins. This study not only explored the therapeutic effect of plant EVs on SAP but also revealed that UA could alleviate SAP by regulating ER-mitochondrial calcium channel and reducing acinar cell necroptosis, providing insights into the pathogenesis and potential treatment of SAP.",

Urolithin A (UA) is a gut microbial metabolite of ellagic acid that stimulates mitophagy. The effects of UA's long-term treatment of AD and mechanisms of action are unknown. METHODS: We addressed these questions in three mouse models of AD with behavioral, electrophysiological, biochemical, and bioinformatic approaches. RESULTS: Long-term UA treatment significantly improved learning, memory, and olfactory function in different AD transgenic mice. UA also reduced amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathologies and enhanced long-term potentiation. UA induced mitophagy via increasing lysosomal functions. UA improved cellular lysosomal function and normalized lysosomal cathepsins, primarily cathepsin Z, to restore lysosomal function in AD, indicating the critical role of cathepsins in UA-induced therapeutic effects on AD. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the importance of lysosomal dysfunction in AD etiology and points to the high translational potential of UA. HIGHLIGHTS: Long-term urolithin A (UA) treatment improved learning, memory, and olfactory function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. UA restored lysosomal functions in part by regulating cathepsin Z (Ctsz) protein. UA modulates immune responses and AD-specific pathophysiological pathways.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the world's second most common gastrointestinal malignancy. Preventing tumor cell proliferation and dissemination is critical for patient survival. Polyphenols have a variety of health advantages and can help prevent cancer. The current study examined different cellular activities of the gut-microbiota metabolite urolithin A (UA) on several colon cancer cell lines. The results revealed that UA suppressed cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In the current investigation, UA substantially affected cell migration in the wound-healing experiment and greatly decreased the number of colonies generated in each CRC cell culture. UA decreased cellular migration in CRC cells 48 h after treatment, which was significant (p < .001) compared to the migration rate in untreated cells. When compared to untreated cells, UA slowed the process of colony formation by reducing the number of colonies or altering their morphological shape. The western blot analysis investigation revealed that UA inhibits cellular metastasis by lowering the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 2 (MMP1 and MMP2) by more than 43% and 41% (p < .001) in HT29, 28% and 149% (p < .001) in SW480, and 90% and 74% (p < .001) in SW620, respectively, at a 100 µM dosage of UA compared to the control. Surprisingly, at a 100 µM dosage of UA, the expression levels of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1) were elevated in HT29, SW480, and SW620 cells treated with 100 µM of UA by more than 89%, 57%, and 29%, respectively. Our findings imply that UA has anticancer properties and might be used therapeutically to treat CRC. The findings provided the first indication of the influence of UA on cellular migration and metastasis in colon cancer cells. All of these data showed that UA might be used as an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of various forms of CRC.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Urolithin A (UA) is a naturally occurring compound that is converted from ellagitannin-like precursors in pomegranates and nuts by intestinal flora. Previous studies have found that UA exerts tumor-suppressive effects through antitumor cell proliferation and promotion of memory T-cell expansion, but its role in tumor-associated macrophages remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: Our study aims to reveal how UA affects tumor macrophages and tumor cells to inhibit breast cancer progression. METHODS: Observe the effect of UA treatment on breast cancer progression though in vivo and in vitro experiments. Western blot and PCR assays were performed to discover that UA affects tumor macrophage autophagy and inflammation. Co-ip and Molecular docking were used to explore specific molecular mechanisms. RESULTS: We observed that UA treatment could simultaneously inhibit harmful inflammatory factors, especially for InterleuKin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), in both breast cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages, thereby improving the tumor microenvironment and delaying tumor progression. Mechanistically, UA induced the key regulator of autophagy, transcription factor EB (TFEB), into the nucleus in a partially mTOR-dependent manner and inhibited the ubiquitination degradation of TFEB, which facilitated the clearance of damaged mitochondria via the mitophagy-lysosomal pathway in macrophages under tumor supernatant stress, and reduced the deleterious inflammatory factors induced by the release of nucleic acid from damaged mitochondria. Molecular docking and experimental studies suggest that UA block the recognition of TFEB by 1433 and induce TFEB nuclear localization. Notably, UA treatment demonstrated inhibitory effects on tumor progression in multiple breast cancer models. CONCLUSION: Our study elucidated the anti-breast cancer effect of UA from the perspective of tumor-associated macrophages. Specifically, TFEB is a crucial downstream target in macrophages.",

Nevertheless, the potential of UroA on bupivacaine (BUP)-induced neurotoxicity has never been reported. Using SH-SY5Y cells to establish a cell model, it was revealed that BUP stimulated cell viability reduction, LDH release increase, and suppression of SIRT1-activated PI3K/AKT signaling in SH-SY5Y cells, whereas UroA treatment caused an effective abrogation of the effects of BUP. Besides, SIRT1 overexpression caused an enhancement in the activity of PI3K/AKT signaling in BUP and UroA co-treated cells, indicating that SIRT1 mediated the activity of PI3K/AKT signaling. Moreover, UroA inhibited BUP-induced apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses in SH-SY5Y cells. However, the effects of UroA on BUP-induced neurotoxicity were all abated by inhibiting SIRT1 or PI3K/AKT signaling through EX527 or LY294002. In conclusion, UroA protected SH-SY5Y cells against BUP-induced injuries through PI3K/AKT signaling in a SIRT1-dependent manner.",

      "abstract": "Neuroinflammation can be triggered by various stimuli, including viral infections. Viruses can directly invade the brain and infect neuronal cells or indirectly trigger a \"cytokine storm\" in the periphery that eventually leads to microglial activation in the brain. While this initial activation of microglial cells is important for viral clearance, chronic activation leads to excessive inflammation and oxidative stress, which can be neurotoxic. Remarkebly, recent studies have shown that certain viruses such as influenza A virus, coronavirus, herpes virus and Epstein-Barr virus may be involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Therefore, it is important to find therapeutic strategies against chronic neuroinflammation triggered by viral infections. Here, we investigated the effects of urolithin A (UA) on microglial activation in vitro induced by a viral mimetic, poly I:C, in a triple co-culture system of neurons, astrocytes and microglial cells. Immunocytochemistry was used to perform a comprehensive single-cell analysis of the morphological changes of microglia as an indicator of their reactive state. Treatment with UA significantly prevented the poly I:C-induced reactive state of microglia, which was characterized by increased expression of the microglial activation markers CD68 and IBA-1. UA restored the poly I:C-induced morphology by restoring microglial ramification. In addition, UA was able to reduce the release of the pro-inflammatory mediators CCL2, TNF-α, and IL-1β and showed a trend toward attenuation of cellular ROS production in poly I:C-treated cultures. Overall, this study suggests that UA as a component of a healthy diet may help prevent virus-induced neuroinflammation and may have therapeutic potential for future studies to prevent or treat neurodegenerative diseases by targeting the associated neuroinflammatory processes."

However, the therapeutic effect and underlying mechanisms of UroA in GC are unclear. We explored the effects and related mechanisms of UroA on GC both in vivo and in vitro. A Cell Counting Kit-8 was used to determine the influence of UroA on the proliferation of GC cell lines. The Autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3MA) was employed to clarify the role of autophagy in the anti-tumor effect of UroA. Simultaneously, we detected the core-component proteins involved in autophagy and its downstream pathways. Subsequently, the in vivo anti-tumor effect of UroA was determined using a xenograft mouse model. Western blotting was used to detect the core protein components of the anti-tumor pathways, and 16S rDNA sequencing was used to detect the effect of UroA on the gut microbiota. We found that UroA suppressed tumor progression. The use of 3MA undermined the majority of the inhibitory effect of UroA on tumor cell proliferation, further confirming the importance of autophagy in the anti-tumor effect of UroA. Invigorating of autophagy activated the downstream Hippo pathway, thereby inhibiting the Warburg effect and promoting cell apoptosis. In addition, UroA modulated the composition of the gut microbiota, as indicated by the increase of probiotics and the decrease of pathogenic bacteria. Our research revealed new anti-tumor mechanisms of UroA, which may be a promising candidate for GC treatment.",

The presence of \"gut-muscle axis\" regulating the onset and progression of exercise-related physical frailty and sarcopenia has been recently hypothesized. This study aims to explore the underlying mechanism of gut-muscle axis by which UA enhances muscle strength and fatigue resistance of sleep-deprived (SD) mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: UA is gavaged to C57BL/6 mice (50 mg kg-1 bw) before 48-h SD. The results indicate that pretreatment of UA significantly enhances motor ability and energy metabolism. The inflammation is suppressed, and intestinal permeability is improved after prophylactic treatment with UA. The decreased level of serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is concomitant with augmentation of the intestinal tight junction proteins. 16s rRNA analysis of colonic contents reveals that UA significantly reduces the abundance of Clostridia_UCG-014 and Candidatus_Saccharimonas, and upregulates Lactobacillus and Muribaculaceae. UA probably influences on gut microbial functions via several energy metabolism pathways, such as carbon metabolism, phosphotransferase system (PTS), and ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters. CONCLUSIONS: The dietary intervention of UA helps to create a systemic protection, a bidirectional communication connecting the gut microbiota with muscle system, able to alleviate SD-induced mobility impairment and gut dysbiosis.",

Urolithin A (UA), a microbiota-produced metabolite of ellagitannins and ellagic acid, is a known stimulator of mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis that has shown cardioprotective effects in experimental models. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2×2 crossover trial was conducted on 10 patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The trial design involved two 4- week intervention periods of UA (500 mg BID) and placebo, separated by a 2-week washout phase. The patients underwent two-dimensional echocardiogram examination as well as blood sampling at the beginning and end of each period. RESULTS: All patients completed the study. The results failed to reveal any significant effect of UA supplementation on echocardiographic measures (LVEF, LVEDD, LVESV, and TAPSE). Plasma concentrations of pro-BNP, glucose, and CRP (p >0.05) were also not altered. Serum HDL-C levels were increased with UA compared with placebo (+6.46 ± 2.33 mg/dL, p =0.026), whereas other lipid indices (LDL-C, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and VLDL-C) remained unchanged (p >0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study do not support any positive effect of UA supplementation in improving echocardiographic and biochemical indices of HFrEF. Further studies with higher doses of UA and longer supplementation duration are encouraged to be conducted.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes is caused by abnormal glucose metabolism, and muscle, the largest tissue in the human body, is largely involved. Urolithin A (UroA) is a major intestinal and microbial metabolite of ellagic acid and ellagitannins and is found in fruits such as strawberry and pomegranate. In this present study, we investigated the antidiabetic effects of UroA in L6 myotubes and in KK-Ay/Ta, a mouse model of type 2 diabetes (T2D). UroA treatment elevated the glucose uptake (GU) of L6 myotubes in the absence of insulin. This elevation in GU by UroA treatment was partially inhibited by the concurrent addition of LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) which activates Akt (PKB: protein kinase B) or Compound C, an inhibitor of 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Moreover, UroA was found to activate both pathways of Akt and AMPK, and then to promote translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) from the cytosol to the plasma membrane in L6 myotubes. Based on these in vitro findings, an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was performed after the oral administration of UroA for 3 weeks to KK-Ay/Ta mice with glucose intolerance. UroA was demonstrated to alleviate glucose intolerance. These results suggest that UroA is a biofactor with antihyperglycemic effects in the T2D state."

      "abstract": "The metabolite urolithin A, a metabolite of the dietary polyphenol ellagic acid (EA), has significant health benefits for humans. However, studies on the gut microbiota involved in ellagic acid metabolism are limited. In this study, we conducted in vitro fermentation of EA using human intestinal microbiome combined with antibiotics (vancomycin, polymyxin B sulfate, and amphotericin B). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis demonstrated that the production capacity of urolithin A by gut microbiota co-treated with polymyxin B sulfate and amphotericin B (22.39 µM) was similar to that of untreated gut microbiota (24.26 µM). Macrogenomics (high-throughput sequencing) was used to analyze the composition and structure of the gut microbiota. The results showed that the abundance of Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and Bifidobacterium bifidum in the gut microbiota without antibiotic treatment or co-treated with polymyxin B sulfate and amphotericin B during EA fermentation was higher than that in other antibiotic treatment gut microbiota. Therefore, B. longum, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum may be new genera involved in the conversion of EA to urolithin A. In conclusion, the study revealed unique interactions between polyphenols and gut microbiota, deepening our understanding of the relationship between phenolic compounds like EA and the gut microbiota. These findings may contribute to the development of gut bacteria as potential probiotics for further development. KEY POINTS: • Intestinal microbiome involved in ellagic acid metabolism. • Gram-positive bacteria in the intestinal microbiome are crucial for ellagic acid metabolism. • Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and Bifidobacterium bifidum participate in ellagic acid metabolism.",

Urolithin A (UA) is reported to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects in ALI. However, its molecular mechanisms in ALI remain to be explored. Mice and BEAS-2B cells were administrated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic the ALI model in vivo and in vitro. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was used to detect the pathological injury of lung tissues. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and culture supernatant and the levels of oxidative stress markers in lung tissues were measured using ELISA. DCFH-DA probe was used to assess the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. TUNEL staining and flow cytometry were performed to determine cell apoptosis. The key targets and pathways were confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot. UA suppressed the pathologic damage, wet/dry weight ratio, and total protein and inflammatory cells in BALF. UA decreased neutrophil infiltration and proinflammatory cytokines production. UA reduced the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in pulmonary tissues. UA also inhibited cell apoptosis in lung tissues by decreasing Bax expression and increasing Bcl-2 expression. In addition, UA suppressed LPS-induced inflammatory factor production, ROS level, and cell apoptosis in BEAS-2B. Importantly, UA decreased the expression of HMGB1 in LPS-treated mice and BEAS-2B cells. HMGB1 overexpression greatly abrogated the inhibition of UA on inflammation, ROS, and cell apoptosis in LPS-administrated BEAS-2B. Furthermore, UA treatment suppressed the phosphorylated levels of p38, JNK, ERK, and p65 in LPS-administrated mice and BEAS-2B cells. UA alleviated lung inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in ALI by targeting HMGB1 to inactivate the MAPK/NF-κB signaling, suggesting the potential of UA to treat ALI.",

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) symptoms can range from diarrhea to life-threatening colon damage. Toxins produced by C. difficile (TcdA and TcdB) cause intestinal epithelial injury and lead to severe gut barrier dysfunction, stem cell damage, and impaired regeneration of the gut epithelium. Current treatment options for intestinal repair are limited. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment with the microbial metabolite urolithin A (UroA) attenuates CDI-induced adverse effects on the colon epithelium in a preclinical model of CDI-induced colitis. Moreover, our analysis suggests that UroA treatment protects against C. difficile-induced inflammation, disruption of gut barrier integrity, and intestinal tight junction proteins in the colon of CDI mice. Importantly, UroA treatment significantly reduced the expression and release of toxins from C. difficile without inducing bacterial cell death. These results indicate the direct regulatory effects of UroA on bacterial gene regulation. Overall, our findings reveal a novel aspect of UroA activity, as it appears to act at both the bacterial and host levels to protect against CDI-induced colitis pathogenesis. This research sheds light on a promising avenue for the development of novel treatments for C. difficile infection.IMPORTANCETherapy for Clostridioides difficile infections includes the use of antibiotics, immunosuppressors, and fecal microbiota transplantation. However, these treatments have several drawbacks, including the loss of colonization resistance, the promotion of autoimmune disorders, and the potential for unknown pathogens in donor samples. To date, the potential benefits of microbial metabolites in CDI-induced colitis have not been fully investigated. Here, we report for the first time that the microbial metabolite urolithin A has the potential to block toxin production from C. difficile and enhance gut barrier function to mitigate CDI-induced colitis.",

The innate immune cGAS-STING pathway has emerged as an important signaling system in the organismal defense against viral and bacterial infections, inflammatory responses to cellular damage, regulation of autophagy, and tumor immunosurveillance. These key functions of the cGAS-STING pathway make it an attractive target for pharmacological intervention in disease treatments and in controlling inflammation and immunity. Here, we show that urolithin A (UA), an ellagic acid metabolite, exerts a profound effect on the expression of STING and enhances cGAS-STING activation and cytosolic DNA clearance in human cell lines. Animal laboratory models and limited human trials have reported no obvious adverse effects of UA administration. Thus, the use of UA alone or in combination with other pharmacological compounds may present a potential therapeutic approach in the treatment of human diseases that involves aberrant activation of the cGAS-STING pathway or accumulation of cytosolic DNA and this warrants further investigation in relevant transgenic animal models.",

      "abstract": "Sleep deprivation (SD) has reached epidemic proportions worldwide and negatively affects people of all ages. Cognitive impairment induced by SD involves neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Urolithin A (UA) is a natural compound that can reduce neuroinflammation and improve mitochondrial health, but its therapeutic effects in a SD model have not yet been studied. Young (3-months old) and aged (12-months old) mice were sleep deprived for 24 h, and UA (2.5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally for 7 consecutive days before the SD period. Immunofluorescent staining, western blotting, and RT-PCR were employed to evaluate levels of proteins involved in neuroinflammation and mitochondrial function. Transmission electron microscope and Golgi-Cox staining were used to evaluate mitochondrial and neuronal morphology, respectively. Finally, contextual fear conditioning and the Morris water maze test were conducted to assess hippocampal learning and memory. In the hippocampus of young (3 months-old) and aged (12 months-old) mice subjected to 24 h SD, pretreatment with UA prevented the activation of microglia and astrocytes, NF-κB-NLRP3 signaling and IL-1β, IL6, TNF-α cytokine production, thus ameliorating neuroinflammation. Furthermore, UA also attenuated SD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, normalized autophagy and mitophagy and protected hippocampal neuronal morphology. Finally, UA prevented SD-induced hippocampal memory impairment. Cumulatively, the results show that UA imparts cognitive protection by reducing neuroinflammation and enhancing mitochondrial function in SD mice. This suggests that UA shows promise as a therapeutic for the treatment of SD-induced neurological disorders.",

      "abstract": "The aging of an organism is hallmarked by systemic loss of functional tissue, resulting in increased fragility and eventual development of age-related neurodegenerative, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and neoplastic diseases. Growing scientific evidence points to mitochondrial dysfunction as a key contributor in the aging process and subsequent development of age-related pathologies. Under normal physiologic conditions, the body removes dysfunctional mitochondria via an autophagic process known as mitophagy. Urolithin A (UA), a metabolite produced when gut microflora digests the polyphenol compounds ellagitannin and ellagic acid, is a known inducer of mitophagy via several identified mechanisms of action. The primary objective of this scoping review is to identify and summarize the clinical relevance of UA supplementation in the prevention of age-related pathology and diseases. A computer-assisted literature review was performed using PubMed and EMBASE for primary source research articles examining UA supplementation and aging-related pathologies. A total of 293 articles were initially identified from a database search, and 15 articles remained for inclusion in this review, based on predetermined criteria. Analysis of the 15 identified publications demonstrated that UA holds potential as a dietary intervention for slowing the progression of aging and preventing the development of age-related disease. This review also illustrates the potential role that mitochondrial health and inflammation play in the progression of age-related pathology. Identifying the clinical relevance of UA supplementation in the prevention of age-related pathology and diseases will help further the focus of research on treatments that may improve the longevity and quality of life in patients at risk for these comorbidities."

Here in this study, we sought to investigate whether mitophagy would be activated when UA alleviated NP in mice. We showed that the autophagy flow was blocked in the spinal dorsal horn of the chronic constriction injury (CCI) mice when the most obvious pain behavior occurs. Intraperitoneal injection of UA markedly activated the mitophagy mediated by PTEN-induced kinase 1/Parkin, promoted mitobiogenesis in both neurons and microglia, and alleviated NP in the CCI mice.

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a significant contributor to cancer-related morbidity and mortality, and it is known for its resistance to conventional treatment regimens, including chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-based therapies. We have previously shown that Urolithin A (Uro A), a gut microbial metabolite derived from pomegranates, can target and inhibit KRAS-dependent PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways to overcome therapeutic resistance and improve survival in PDAC. However, the effect of Uro A on the tumor immune microenvironment and its ability to enhance ICB efficacy has not been explored. This study demonstrates that Uro A treatment reduces stromal fibrosis and reinvigorates the adaptive T-cell immune response to overcome resistance to PD-1 blockade in a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of PDAC. Flow cytometric-based analysis of Uro A-treated mouse tumors revealed a significant attenuation of immunosuppressive tumor-associated M2-like macrophages with a concurrent increase in the infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with memory-like phenotype along with reduced expression of the exhaustion-associated protein, PD-1. Importantly, the combination of Uro A treatment with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy promoted enhancement of the antitumor response with increased infiltration of CD4+ Th1 cells, ultimately resulting in a remarkable improvement in overall survival in GEMM of PDAC. Overall, our findings provide preclinical evidence for the potential of Uro A as a novel therapeutic agent to increase sensitivity to immunotherapy in PDAC and warrant further mechanistic exploration in preclinical and clinical studies. SIGNIFICANCE: Immunotherapeutic agents are ineffective against pancreatic cancer, mainly due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and stromal desmoplasia. Our current study demonstrates the therapeutic utility of a novel gut microbial metabolite, Uro A, to remodel the stromal-immune microenvironment and improve overall survival with anti-PD-1 therapy in pancreatic cancer.",

      "abstract": "SCOPE: A range of health benefits are attributed to consuming urolithin A (UA), such as improved muscle health, anti-aging activity, and neuroprotection, whereas few studies raise possible adverse effects at high doses, including genotoxicity and estrogenic effects. Therefore, understanding UA bioactivity and safety depends on its pharmacokinetics. However, there is no physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model available for UA, thus limiting reliable assessment of effects observed from in vitro experimentation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We characterizes glucuronidation rates of UA by human S9 fractions. Partitioning and other physicochemical parameters are predicted using quantitative structure-activity relationship tools. Solubility and dissolution kinetics are determined experimentally. These parameters are used to construct a PBPK model, and results are compared with data from human intervention studies. We evaluates how different supplementation scenarios may influence UA plasma and tissue concentrations. Concentrations at which either toxic or beneficial effects are previously observed in vitro appear unlikely to be achieved in vivo. CONCLUSION: A first PBPK model for UA is established. It enables prediction of systemic UA concentrations and is critical for extrapolating in vitro results to in vivo uses. Results support the safety of UA, but also challenge the potential for readily achieving beneficial effects by postbiotic supplementation.",

The current work examines the various mechanisms through which URO A protects against doxorubicin (DOX)-induced liver injury in Wistar rats. In this experiment, Wistar rats were administered DOX intraperitoneally (20 mg kg-1) on day 7 while given URO A intraperitoneally (2.5 or 5 mg kg-1 d-1) for 14 days. The serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) were measured. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to evaluate histopathological characteristics, and then antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties were evaluated in tissue and serum, respectively. We also looked at how active caspase 3 and cytochrome c oxidase were in the liver. The findings demonstrated that supplementary URO A therapy clearly mitigated DOX-induced liver damage. The antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT were elevated in the liver, and the levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, NF-kB, and IL-6, in the tissue were significantly attenuated, all of which complemented the beneficial effects of URO A in DOX-induced liver injury. In addition, URO A was able to alter the expression of caspase 3 and cytochrome c oxidase in the livers of rats that were subjected to DOX stress. These results showed that URO A reduced DOX-induced liver injury by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis."

      "abstract": "Ellagic acid (EA) exhibits potential antiaging activity. Differences in individual ability to produce urolithins may result in large interindividual variability in the health effects of EA. Therefore, the effects and mechanism of EA on d-galactose-induced aging, considering urolithin A-producing ability, were investigated. Our results showed that EA improved cognitive impairment and hippocampal damage, increased the GABA (by 107.84-117.86%) and 5-HT (by 72.56-100.85%) levels, and suppressed the inflammatory and oxidative stress in aging rats. Thirteen plasma metabolites and 12 brain metabolites were improved by EA administration in aging rats. In particular, EA showed a better anti-aging effect in high-UroA-producing rats than in the low counterparts, while antibiotic intervention almost offset EA-alleviated aging induced by d-gal. Furthermore, the lower ratio of Firmicutes and Bacteroidota as well as the greater abundances of Akkermansia (by 139.21%), Bifidobacterium (by 88.04%), Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 (by 183.47%), Lactobacillus (by 97.23%), and Turicibacter (by 83.06%) were observed in the high-UroA-producing group compared with the model group (p < 0.05). These findings provide novel insights into the anti-aging effects of EA and suggest that the ability of the gut microbiota responding to EA largely determines EA's anti-aging performance.",

      "abstract": "SCOPE: The gut microbial metabolite Urolithin A (UA) exhibits anti-inflammatory properties in vivo and in vitro. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is present in abundance in the gut, induces chronic neuroinflammation and triggers behavioral abnormalities. However, the neuroprotective effects of UA and the underlying mechanisms implicate in an LPS-elicited neuroinflammation mouse model remain elusive. METHODS AND RESULTS: Daily administration of UA (200 mg kg-1 d-1 ; i.g.) for 21 days significantly mitigates cognitive deficits following LPS exposure. UA prevents LPS-induced neural loss and synaptic injury in the hippocampus. UA administration substantially represses LPS-triggered glial cell activation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6). Further study reveals that UA promotes Sirt1 expression and NF-κB p65 deacetylation. Importantly, all the beneficial effects of UA, including biochemical and neuropathological changes and cognitive function, are abrogated by 6-chloro-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-carbazole-1-carboxamide (EX-527), a specific Sirt1 inhibitor. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that UA ameliorates LPS-triggered neural/synaptic damage and cognitive deficits, which potentially contributes to the inhibition of neuroinflammation by promoting the Sirt1/acetyl-NF-κB signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "Accumulating evidence has confirmed the health benefits of walnut diets in maintaining brain function with age. Recent studies have indicated that walnut polyphenols (WP) and their active metabolites urolithins may play an important role in the health benefits of walnut diets. In the present study, we evaluated the protective effect of WP and urolithin A (UroA) on H2O2-induced damage in human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells, and investigated its mechanisms in the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-mediated signaling pathway, which is tightly involved in neurodegenerative and neurological diseases. The results demonstrated that both WP (50 and 100 μg mL-1) and UroA (5 and 10 μM) treatment significantly reversed the decrease of cell viability, the leakage of extracellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the overload of intracellular calcium and cell apoptosis induced by H2O2 treatment. Moreover, WP and UroA treatment also relieved H2O2-induced oxidative stress including overproduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Additionally, western blot analysis showed that WP and UroA treatment significantly increased the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and the expression of pCREB (Ser133) and its downstream molecule brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which were decreased by H2O2 treatment. Furthermore, pretreatment with the PKA inhibitor H89 abolished the protective effects of WP and UroA, indicating that up-regulation of the PKA/CREB/BDNF neurotrophic signaling pathway is required for their neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress. The current work provides new perspectives for understanding the beneficial effects of WP and UroA on brain function, which warrants further investigation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Urolithin A (UA) is a metabolite produced by gut microbiota from ingested ellagic acid. Although the effect of ellagic acid intake on vascular endothelial function (VEF) improvement has been reported, the effect of UA intake on VEF improvement remains obscure. In addition, UA has been reported to improve the intestinal barrier function, and UA may have improved VEF by gut microbiome alteration. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we conducted a clinical trial to explore and analyze the effects of UA intake on vascular endothelial function (VEF) and characteristics of the intestinal environment, such as gut microbiome profiling and organic acid composition. METHODS: A placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blinded, parallel group trial was conducted on participants who could metabolize small amounts of UA from ellagic acid (non-UA producers) and had relatively poor VEF. VEF was assessed using the flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) score. Participants were administered placebo, UA 10 mg/day, or UA 50 mg/day for 12 weeks. FMD was measured and fecal samples were collected at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. Gut microbiome analysis and organic acid level measurements were performed to evaluate the effects of UA intake on the intestinal environment. This clinical trial is publicly registered at the UMIN-CTR, trial number: UMIN000042014. RESULTS: The gut microbiota of the UA 50 mg/day group showed a significant increase in alpha diversity (Faith's phylogenetic diversity). Four and nine microbial genera were significantly altered in the UA 10 mg/day and UA 50 mg/day groups, respectively (p < 0.05, not corrected). Participants whose FMD scores improved with UA intake had poor baseline FMD values as well as a low Bacillota/Bacteroidota ratio. CONCLUSION: Urolithin A intake alters the gut microbiota and improves their alpha diversity. In addition, the effect of UA on VEF correlated with the individual gut microbiota. Our results have practical implications for a new approach to providing healthcare that focuses on intestinal environment-based diet therapy."

However, the exact role of UA in gastric cancer (GC) progression remains largely unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects and potential mechanisms of UA in GC in vitro and in vivo. Our results revealed that UA could suppress GC cell proliferation, inhibit migration and invasion, promote apoptosis, and induce autophagy via the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in vitro. The autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine and chloroquine augmented the inhibitory effect of UA on proliferation and promoted apoptosis, implying that UA mediated the cytoprotective role of autophagy. Meanwhile, the in vivo experiments showed that UA effectively suppressed tumor growth, enhanced the therapeutic effects, and alleviated chemotherapy toxicity in xenograft models. Overall, these findings offer novel insights into the role of UA in tumor therapy and suggest that UA may possess potential therapeutic applications for GC.",

UA-induced TSCM formation depended on Pink1-mediated mitophagy triggering cytosolic release of the mitochondrial phosphatase Pgam5.

      "abstract": "Urolithin A (UA; 3,8-dihydroxybenzo[c]chromen-6-one), a metabolite generated by intestinal bacteria during the biotransformation of ellagitannins, has gained considerable attention in treating several cancers. Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) remains one of the most lethal cancers; it grows in a special environment constantly exposed to both blood and bile. Since UA is known to undergo enterohepatic recirculation, we hypothesized that UA might have significant antitumor effects in CCA. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of UA in CCA and aimed to elucidate its mechanisms, including autophagy. UA treatment inhibited cell proliferation and induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in CCA cells. UA also suppressed cell migration and invasion, but did not cause apoptosis. Furthermore, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry demonstrated increased LC3-II accumulation, while electron microscopy demonstrated induced autophagosomes after UA treatment, suggesting that UA upregulated autophagy in CCA cells. In xenograft mice treated with UA, tumor growth was inhibited with increased LC3-II levels. On the other hand, phospho-kinase array demonstrated downregulation of the AKT/WNK1 pathway. LC3-II expression was elevated in WNK1 knocked down cells, indicating that WNK1 is the key signal for regulating autophagy. Thus, UA exerted antitumor effects by suppressing the AKT/WNK1 signaling pathway and inducing autophagy. In conclusion, UA, a natural, well-tolerated compound, may be a promising therapeutic candidate for advanced CCA."

Urolithin-A (UA), an intermediate product produced by the catabolism of ellagitannins in the gastrointestinal tract, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties for inflammation, oxidative damage, and aging-related diseases. Hence, we prepared UA-loaded hydrogels and embedded them in the lumen of PCL nerve guide conduits (NGCs). The hydrogels continuously released appropriate doses of UA into the microenvironment. Based on in vitro studies, UA facilitates cell proliferation and reduces oxidative damage. Besides, the experimental evaluation revealed good biocompatibility of the materials involved. We implanted NGCs into rat models to bridge the sciatic nerve defects in an in vivo study. The sciatic functional index of the PCL/collagen/UA group was comparable to that of the autograft group. Additionally, the consequences of electrophysiological, gastrocnemius muscle and nerve histology assessment of the PCL/collagen/UA group were better than those in the PCL and PCL/collagen groups and close to those in the autograft group. In this study, UA sustained release via the PCL/collagen/UA NGC was found to be an effective alternative treatment for PNI, validating our hypothesis that UA could promote regeneration of nerve tissue.",

Gut microbiota provide significant benefits to its host, most notably via maintaining immunological homeostasis.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cytochrome P450 Family 1 Subfamily A Member 1 (CYP1A1) pathway, which is regulated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) plays an important role in chemical carcinogenesis and xenobiotic metabolism. Recently, we demonstrated that the microbial metabolite Urolithin A (UroA) mitigates colitis through its gut barrier protective and anti-inflammatory activities in an AhR-dependent manner. Here, we explored role of CYP1A1 in UroA-mediated gut barrier and immune functions in regulation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: To determine the role of CYP1A1 in UroA-mediated protectives activities against colitis, we subjected C57BL/6 mice and Cyp1a1 -/- mice to dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced acute colitis model. The phenotypes of the mice were characterized by determining loss of body weight, intestinal permeability, systemic and colonic inflammation. Further, we evaluated the impact of UroA on regulation of immune cell populations by flow cytometry and confocal imaging using both in vivo and ex vivo model systems. RESULTS: UroA treatment mitigated DSS-induced acute colitis in the wildtype mice. However, UroA-failed to protect Cyp1a1 -/- mice against colitis, as evident from non-recovery of body weight loss, shortened colon lengths and colon weight/length ratios. Further, UroA failed to reduce DSS-induced inflammation, intestinal permeability and upregulate tight junction proteins in Cyp1a1 -/- mice. Interestingly, UroA induced the expansion of T-reg cells in a CYP1A1-dependent manner both in vivo and ex vivo models. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that CYP1A1 expression is essential for UroA-mediated enhanced gut barrier functions and protective activities against colitis. We postulate that CYP1A1 plays critical and yet unknown functions beyond xenobiotic metabolism in the regulation of gut epithelial integrity and immune systems to maintain gut homeostasis in IBD pathogenesis.",

      "abstract": "Heavy alcohol consumption is the dominant risk factor for chronic pancreatitis (CP); however, treatment and prevention strategies for alcoholic chronic pancreatitis (ACP) remains limited. The present study demonstrates that ACP induction in C57BL/6 mice causes significant acinar cell injury, pancreatic stellate cell (PSC) activation, exocrine function insufficiency, and an increased fibroinflammatory response when compared with alcohol or CP alone. Although the withdrawal of alcohol during ACP recovery led to reversion of pancreatic damage, continued alcohol consumption with established ACP perpetuated pancreatic injury. In addition, phosphokinase array and Western blot analysis of ACP-induced mice pancreata revealed activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) signaling pathways possibly orchestrating the fibroinflammatory program of ACP pathogenesis. Mice treated with urolithin A (Uro A, a gut-derived microbial metabolite) in the setting of ACP with continued alcohol intake (during the recovery period) showed suppression of AKT and P70S6K activation, and acinar damage was significantly reduced with a parallel reduction in pancreas-infiltrating macrophages and proinflammatory cytokine accumulation. These results collectively provide mechanistic insight into the impact of Uro A on attenuation of ACP severity through suppression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways and can be a useful therapeutic approach in patients with ACP with continuous alcohol intake.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our novel findings presented here demonstrate the utility of Uro A as an effective therapeutic agent in attenuating alcoholic chronic pancreatitis (ACP) severity with alcohol continuation after established disease, through suppression of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.",

Our findings reveal significantly increased positive effects of urolithin A and a combination treatment of urolithin A+EGCG in hAbKI mice for phenotypic behavioral changes including motor coordination, locomotion/exploratory activity, spatial learning and working memory. mRNA and protein levels of mitochondrial fusion, synaptic, mitophagy and autophagy genes were upregulated, and mitochondrial fission genes are downregulated in urolithin A and combine treatment in hAbKI mice; however, the effect is stronger in combined treatment. Immunofluorescence analysis of hippocampal brain sections shows similar findings of mRNA and protein levels. Mitochondrial dysfunction is significantly reduced in both treatment groups, but a stronger reduction is observed in combined treatment. Dendritic spines and lengths are significantly increased in both treatment groups, but the effect is stronger in combined treatment. The fragmented number of mitochondria is reduced, and mitochondrial length is increased, and mitophagosomal formations are increased in both the groups, but the effect is stronger in the combined treatment. The levels of amyloid beta (Aβ) 40 and Aβ42 are reduced in both treatments, however, the reduction is higher for combined treatment. These observations suggest that urolithin A is protective against human Aβ peptide-induced toxicities; however, combined treatment of urolithin A+EGCG is effective and stronger, indicating that combined therapy is promising to treat late-onset AD patients.",

OBJECTIVE: To explore the inhibitory effect of UroA on NPC and potential mechanism in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA-sequencing-based mechanistic prediction was conducted by comparing KEGG enrichment of 40 μM UroA-treated for 24 h with untreated CNE2 cells. The untreated cells were selected as control. After NPC cells were treated with 20-60 μM UroA, proliferation, migration and invasion of were measured by colony formation, wound healing and transwell experiments. Apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by flow cytometry, Hoechst 33342, Rhodamine 123, JC-1 staining and ROS assay methods, respectively. Gene and protein expression were measured by RT-qPCR and Western blotting assay. RESULTS: RNA-sequencing and KEGG enrichment revealed UroA mainly altered the ECM receptor interaction pathway. UroA inhibited cells proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal-transition pathway, migration and invasion with IC50 values of 34.72 μM and 44.91 μM, induced apoptosis, MMP depolarization and increase ROS content at a concentration of 40 μM. UroA up-regulated E-cadherin, Bax/Bcl-2, c-caspase-3 and PARP proteins, while inhibiting COL4A1, MMP2, MMP9, N-cadherin, Vimentin and Snail proteins at 20-60 μM. Moreover, co-treatment of UroA (40 μM) and NAC (5 mM) could reverse the effect of UroA on apoptosis-related proteins. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: RNA-sequencing technology based on bioinformatic analyses may be applicable for studiying the mechanism of drugs for tumour treatment.",

      "abstract": "Urolithin A (UroA) is one of the primary intestinal metabolites of ellagitannins, showing translational potential as a nutritional intervention in humans. Mounting evidence suggests that fructose consumption contributes to the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that manifests in hyperuricemic nephropathy, renal inflammation, and tubulointerstitial injury. Here, we investigated the efficacy of UroA in alleviating fructose-induced hyperuricemic nephropathy in mice. Uric acid-exposed human kidney-2 (HK-2) cells were utilized for in vitro mechanism validation. Histopathological staining, immunoblotting, and transmission electron microscope were performed for the mechanistic investigations. Our results revealed that UroA ameliorated fructose-induced hyperuricemic nephropathy in mice. The histopathologic assessment showed that UroA attenuated tubular hypertrophy and dilation, glomerular basement membrane thickening, and collagen deposition in the kidney of fructose-fed mice. Mechanistically, UroA treatment impaired STING-NLRP3 activation, resulting in reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Notably, UroA exhibited a scavenging effect against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and restored fructose-impaired PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in nephropathic mice. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of UroA in STING-NLRP3 activation was impaired after Parkin gene silencing in HK-2 cells. Together, this study suggests that UroA alleviates fructose-induced hyperuricemic nephropathy by promoting Parkin-dependent mitophagy, thereby suppressing STING-NLRP3 axis-mediated inflammatory response. Thus, dietary supplementation with UroA or ellagitannins-rich foods may serve as a promising intervention to prevent CKD progression."

According to the World Health Organization, OA affects over 500 million people and is characterized by degradation of cartilage and other joint tissues, severe pain, and impaired mobility. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to OA pathology. However, interventions to rescue mitochondrial defects in human OA are not available. Urolithin A (Mitopure) is a natural postbiotic compound that promotes mitophagy and mitochondrial function and beneficially impacts muscle health in preclinical models of aging and in elderly and middle-aged humans. Here, we showed that Urolithin A improved mitophagy and mitochondrial respiration in primary chondrocytes from joints of both healthy donors and OA patients. Furthermore, Urolithin A reduced disease progression in a mouse model of OA, decreasing cartilage degeneration, synovial inflammation, and pain. These improvements were associated with increased mitophagy and mitochondrial content, in joints of OA mice. These findings indicate that UA promotes joint mitochondrial health, alleviates OA pathology, and supports Urolithin A's potential to improve mobility with beneficial effects on structural damage in joints.",

Accumulating studies have reported its multiple potential health benefits in a broad range of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, cognitive impairment, and diabetes. In particular, Uro A is safe via direct oral administration and is non-genotoxic. The pancreas plays a central role in regulating energy consumption and metabolism by secreting digestive enzymes and hormones. Numerous pathophysiological factors, such as inflammation, deficits of mitophagy, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, can negatively affect the pancreas, leading to pancreatic diseases, including pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and diabetes mellitus. Recent studies showed that Uro A activates autophagy and inhibits endoplasmic reticulum stress in the pancreas, thus decreasing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. In this review, we summarize the knowledge of Uro A metabolism and biological activity in the gut, as well as the pathological features and mechanisms of common pancreatic diseases. Importantly, we focus on the potential activities of Uro A and the underlying mechanisms in ameliorating various pancreatic diseases via inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways, activating autophagy, maintaining the mitochondrial function, and improving the immune microenvironment. It might present a novel nutritional strategy for the intervention and prevention of pancreatic diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Urolithin A is the metabolite of natural polyphenol ellagic acid and ellagitannins generated by gut microbiota. Urolithin A is better absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract than its parent substances. Thus, the variable effects of ellagitannin-reach food (like pomegranate fruit, walnuts, tea, and others) on people's health might be linked with the differences in individual microbiota content. Urolithin A possesses various anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects, as shown by in vivo and in vitro studies. OBJECTIVES: In the current review, we consider anti-inflammatory and direct anti-cancer urolithin A effects as well as their molecular mechanisms, which might be the basement of clinical trials, estimating urolithin A anti-cancer effects. CONCLUSION: Urolithin A attenuated the pro-inflammatory factors production (IL-6, IL-1β, NOS2 and others) in vitro studies. Oral urolithin A treatment caused prominent anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory action in various in vivo studies, including colitis rat model, carrageenan-induced paw edema mice model, models of pancreatic cancer, and models of obesity. The main molecular mechanisms of these effects might be the modulation of aryl hydrocarbon receptors, which antagonism may lead to decreasing of chronic inflammation. Other primary targets of urolithin A might be the processes of protein phosphorylation (for instance, it decreases the phosphorylation of protein kinase B) and p53 stabilization. Anti-inflammatory effects of urolithin A can be reached in physiologically relevant concentrations. This might be of vital importance for preventing immune suppression associated with chronic inflammation in cancer. Considering the favorable urolithin A safety profile, it is a promising compound for cancer treatment and prevention.",

There is no effective therapy available yet. In this study we investigated whether defective mitophagy contributed to MC and whether urolithin A (UA), a naturally occurring microflora-derived metabolite, could protect against MC in experimental obese mice. Mice were fed high fat diet for 20 weeks to establish a diet-induced obese model. We showed that mitochondrial autophagy or mitophagy was significantly downregulated in the heart of experimental obese mice. UA (50 mg·kg-1·d-1, for 4 weeks) markedly activated mitophagy and ameliorated MC in obese mice by gavage. In PA-challenged H9C2 cardiomyocytes, UA (5 μM) significantly increased autophagosomes and decreased autolysosomes. Furthermore, UA administration rescued PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy and relieved mitochondrial defects in the heart of obese mice, which led to improving cardiac diastolic function and ameliorating cardiac remodelling. In PA-challenged primarily isolated cardiomyocytes, both application of mitophagy inhibitor Mdivi-1 (15 μM) and silencing of mitophagy gene Parkin blunted the myocardial protective effect of UA. In summary, our data suggest that restoration of mitophagy with UA ameliorates symptoms of MC, which highlights a therapeutic potential of UA in the treatment of MC.",

Urolithin A (Uro-A) is a gut microbiome-derived compound that is mainly produced from pomegranates and some nuts. Uro-A has attracted great attention in recent years in view of its protective effects on aging-related diseases, including muscle dysfunction, kidney disease and knee injury. However, its protective influence and possible mechanisms in senile osteoporosis remain unclear. Our study describes the beneficial effect of Uro-A on bone marrow macrophages (BMMs). The in vitro results demonstrated that Uro-A inhibited receptor activator for nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis in BMMs in a concentration-dependent manner. Uro-A significantly reduced the expression of osteoclast-related genes and bone resorption. Mechanistically, we found that the autophagy ability of BMMs was significantly enhanced in the early stage of Uro-A treatment, accompanied by the activation of LC3 and Beclin 1. At the same time, this enhanced autophagy activity was maintained until the later stage after stimulation with RANKL. Furthermore, we found that the MARK signaling pathway was blocked by Uro-A treatment. In a mouse model of aging, Uro-A effectively inhibited bone loss in the proximal femur, spine and tibia of aging mice. These results indicated that Uro-A is a robust and effective treatment for preventing senile osteoporosis bone loss."

Despite growing concern of occurrence in aging populations and development secondary to diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, we currently have very few options to tackle this global problem. Creating effective and high-throughput screening strategies is as important as the intervention itself. Here, we present for the first time a robust ex vivo rat eye model of histamine-induced vascular damage for investigating the therapeutic potential of paclitaxel (PTX) and urolithin A (UA) as alternatives to dexamethasone for preventing vascular damage in the retina. Extensive loss of vascularization and apoptosis were observed in the histamine-challenged group and successfully prevented in the intervention groups, more significantly in the PTX and UA. These important early results indicate that PTX and UA could be developed as potential preventive strategies for a wide variety of retinal diseases.",

      "abstract": "Aging of sensory organs is associated with a decline in mitochondrial function and the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. Impaired mitophagy blocks the turnover of dysfunctional mitochondria and leads to their accumulation. Urolithin A (UA) induces mitophagy in various mammalian cells. This study was aimed at investigating the effect of the mitophagy activator, UA, on premature senescent auditory cells. The levels of cellular senescence-associated p53 and p21 significantly increased in H2O2-induced senescent House Ear Institute-Organ of Corti 1 (HEI-OC1) cells and cochlear explants. However, the levels of mitophagy-related molecules significantly decreased. UA significantly decreased the expression of senescence-associated p53 and p21, and increased the expression of mitophagy-related proteins, in H2O2-induced senescent cells and cochlear explants. The percentage of β-galactosidase-stained senescent cells also reduced in H2O2-treated cells and cochlear explants upon UA pre-treatment. The formation of mitophagosomes and mitophagolysosomes was restored upon UA pre-treatment of H2O2-induced senescent cells. The knockdown of mitophagy-related genes (Parkin and Bnip3) resulted in annulment of UA-induced anti-senescent activity. UA significantly increased the ATP content, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity, and mitochondrial membrane potential in senescent HEI-OC1 cells. These findings indicate that UA counteracted mitophagy decline and prevented premature senescence in auditory cells. Hence, UA administration might be a promising strategy for preventing mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with age-related hearing loss.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This research was focused to examine the potential targets, action network, and mechanism of urolithin A (UA) in spinal cord injury (SCI) management exploiting the network pharmacology (NP). METHODS: We used the SwissTargetPrediction, PharmMapper, and TargetNet databases to obtain UA action targets. We searched the OMIM, GeneCards, CTD, and DrugBank databases to screen selected target genes for SCI treatment. The intersection of target genes between the UA and SCI databases was obtained by constructing Venn diagrams, which led to the identification of common druggable targets for the disease. The relationship network of the targets was built with Cytoscape 3.7.2, and the protein interaction network was analyzed with the STRING platform. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network can be built on the STRING database. Gene Ontology (GO) function and KEGG pathway analyses of target intersections were completed with the DAVID 6.8 database. We constructed preliminary network targets for actions underlying UA-SCI interactions. Using the AutoDock software, we examined the molecular docking interactions between UA and its target proteins and further verified the mechanism of the action of UA. RESULTS: We obtained 318 UA drug targets and 1492 SCI disease targets. We identified a total of 118 common UA-SCI targets. Based on the PPI analysis, we identified MAPK1, SRC, AKT1, HRAS, MAPK8, HSP90AA1, MAPK14, JAK2, ESR1, and NF-κB1 as possible therapeutic targets. Enrichment analysis revealed that the PI3K-AKT, VEGF, and TNF signaling pathways could be critical for the NP analysis. Molecular docking indicated that UA had a strong affinity for docked proteins (binding energy range: -6.3 to -9.3 kcal mol-1). CONCLUSIONS: We employed an NP approach to validate and predict the underlying mechanisms associated with UA therapy for SCI. An additional purpose of this study was to provide a theoretical basis for further experimental studies on UA's potential in SCI treatment."

In this context, resolution of inflammation using natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory such as urolithin A (UA) could prove beneficial.

Neovascularization plays a crucial role in skin wound healing by delivering fresh nutrients and oxygen to the wound area. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of urolithin A (UA) in angiogenesis during wound healing. The results of in vitro experiments showed that treatment with UA (5-20 μM) promoted the proliferation, migration, and angiogenic capacity of HUVECs. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of UA in vivo using a full-thickness skin wound model. Subsequently, we found that UA promoted the regeneration of new blood vessels, which is consistent with the results of accelerated angiogenesis in vitro experiments. After UA treatment, the blood vessels in the wound are rapidly formed, and the deposition and remodeling process of the collagen matrix is also accelerated, which ultimately promotes the effective wound healing. Mechanistic studies have shown that UA promotes angiogenesis by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway. Our study provides evidence that UA can promote angiogenesis and skin regeneration in chronic wounds, especially ischemic wounds."

Urolithin A (UA), a major metabolite of ellagic acid, exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant functions in various human diseases. This study, for the first time, uncovered the role of UA in DR pathogenesis. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were used to determine the effects of UA on blood glucose levels, retinal structures, inflammation, and oxidative stress. High glucose (HG)-induced human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) were used to elucidate the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms of UA in DR in vitro. The in vivo experiments demonstrated that UA injection reduced blood glucose levels, decreased albumin and vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations, and ameliorated the injured retinal structures caused by DR. UA administration also inhibited inflammation and oxidative damage in the retinal tissues of diabetic rats. Similar anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of UA were observed in HRECs induced by HG. Furthermore, we found that UA elevated the levels of nuclear Nrf2 and HO-1 both in vivo and in vitro. Nrf2 silencing reversed the inhibitory effects of UA on inflammation and oxidative stress during DR progression. Together, our findings indicate that UA can ameliorate DR by repressing inflammation and oxidative stress via the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, which suggests that UA could be an effective drug for clinical DR treatment.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia worldwide. The classical AD brain is characterized by extracellular deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein aggregates as senile plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of hyper-phosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein Tau. There has been limited success in clinical trials for some proposed therapies for AD, so attention has been drawn toward using alternative approaches, including prevention strategies. As a result, nutraceuticals have become attractive compounds for their potential neuroprotective capabilities. The objective of the present study was to derive a synergistic nutraceutical combination in vitro that may act as a potential preventative therapy for AD. The compounds of interest were docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), luteolin (LUT), and urolithin A (UA). The cell viability and cytotoxicity assays MTS and LDH were used to evaluate the compounds individually and in two-compound combinations, for their ability to inhibit Aβ1-42-induced toxicity in human neuroblastoma BE(2)-M17 cells. The LDH-derived% protection values were used in the program CompuSyn v.1.0 to calculate the combination index (CI) of the two-compound combinations. The software-predicted potentially synergistic (CI < 1) two-compound combinations were validated using CellTiter Glo assay. Finally, a three-compound combination was predicted (D5L5U5) and shown to be the most effective at inhibiting Aβ1-42-induced toxicity. The synergistic combination, D5L5U5 warrants further research for its mechanism of action; however, it can serve as a basis to develop an advanced functional food for the prevention or co-treatment of AD."

METHODS AND RESULTS: The UA-treated T2DM mice display an attenuated cognitive impairment as well as reduced levels of metabolic endotoxemia and proinflammatory cytokines in serum. A systemic restraint of gut/brain inflammation in UA-treated T2DM mice is also observed as the downregulation of TLR4 and Myd88 in colon along with the inhibition of GFAP, Iba-1, NLRP3, and inflammation-related genes in brain. Moreover, UA ameliorates gut barrier dysfunction by upregulating tight-junction proteins levels. Furthermore, UA restores the hyperglycemia-mediated downregulation of genes involved in N-glycan biosynthesis both in vivo and in vitro, which plays a crucial role in barrier integrity. Although UA shares similar beneficial effects on diabetes with metformin, unlike metformin, the effect of UA is independent of gut microbiome and short chain fatty acids. Taken together, these data suggest that feeding UA can attenuate diabetes-associated cognitive impairment by ameliorating systemic inflammation and intestinal barrier dysfunction via N-glycan biosynthesis pathway. The study implies UA as a potential novel pharmaceutic target for diabetes therapy via manipulating gut-brain axis and N-glycan metabolism.",

However, its effects on osteoporosis are unclear. This study explored the effects of urolithin A (UA) on receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclasts and its underlying molecular mechanisms. RANKL treatment significantly increased tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP) or osteoclast marker levels (P < 0.05), while adding UA decreased the RANKL-induced levels (P < 0.05) in RAW264.7 cells. Total RNA isolated from RANKL- or RANKL + UA-treated cells was sequenced, and the obtained transcriptome dataset revealed 2,399 differentially expressed genes. They were enriched in multiple pathways involved in rheumatoid arthritis, ERK1 and ERK2 cascade, regulation of inflammatory response, ECM-receptor interactions, and TNF signaling. Scanning electron microscopy showed that RANKL promoted bone resorption pits in bone biopsy specimens, whereas UA inhibited their formation. When bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2) was shRNA-silenced, the bone resorption pits were restored. Moreover, while RANKL significantly enhanced the levels of p-ERK2/ERK2, p-p38/p38, p-Akt1/Akt1, p-ERK1/ERK1, and osteoclast-related proteins (P < 0.05), UA reduced them. BMP2 silencing also reversed the UA inhibitory effect. Thus, UA represses the RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation of RAW264.7 cells by regulating Akt1, p38, and ERK1/2 signaling, and BMP2 likely reverses the UA inhibitory effect via these pathways. We propose BMP2 as a potential drug target for treating bone metabolic diseases, such as osteoporosis.",

In this study, we established adult C57BL/6J mouse models of traumatic brain injury by controlled cortical impact and then intraperitoneally administered UA. We found that UA greatly reduced brain edema; increased the expression of tight junction proteins in injured cortex; increased the immunopositivity of two neuronal autophagy markers, microtubule-associated protein 1A/B light chain 3A/B (LC3) and p62; downregulated protein kinase B (Akt) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), two regulators of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway; decreased the phosphorylation levels of inhibitor of NFκB (IκB) kinase alpha (IKKα) and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), two regulators of the neuroinflammation-related Akt/IKK/NFκB signaling pathway; reduced blood-brain barrier permeability and neuronal apoptosis in injured cortex; and improved mouse neurological function. These findings suggest that UA may be a candidate drug for the treatment of traumatic brain injury, and its neuroprotective effects may be mediated by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Akt/IKK/NFκB signaling pathways, thus reducing neuroinflammation and enhancing autophagy."

Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are activated and promoted by MI to undergo myofibroblast transformation (CMT). Urolithin A (UA) is an active and effective gut metabolite derived from polyphenolics of berries and pomegranate fruits, which has been reported to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant functions. However, whether UA affects the CMT process during myocardial fibrosis remains unclear. METHODS: TGF-β1-treated primary rat cardiac fibroblasts were used for in vitro study. Cell proliferation ability was evaluated by MTT assay. Cell migration and invasion abilities were tested by wound healing and Transwell assays. The expression of CMT process-related markers were measured by qRT-PCR and western blot. The rat MI model was established by left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) ligation and evaluated by H&E and Masson staining. RESULTS: Our data demonstrated that UA treatment could inhibit the CMT process in TGF-β1-induced CFs, including cell proliferation, migration and invasion abilities. Knocking down of Nrf2, which was activated by UA treatment, could mitigate the effects of UA treatment on CMT process. Moreover, in vivo administration of UA in rat MI model successfully up-regulated Nrf2 expression and improved the myocardial damage and fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: The study discovered the function and mechanism of UA on myocardial fibrosis and demonstrated the protective effects of UA administration through activation of Nrf2 pathway.",

      "abstract": "Environmental chemicals such as inorganic arsenic (iAs) significantly contribute to redox toxicity in the human body by enhancing oxidative stress. Imbalanced oxidative stress rapidly interferes with gut homeostasis and affects variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity. It has been shown that gut microbiota are essential to protect against iAs3+-induced toxicity. However, the effect of microbial metabolites on iAs3+-induced toxicity and loss of gut barrier integrity has not been investigated. The objectives of the study are to investigate impact of iAs on gut barrier function and determine benefits of gut microbial metabolite, urolithin A (UroA) against iAs3+-induced adversaries on gut epithelium. We have utilized both colon epithelial cells and in a human intestinal 3D organoid model system to investigate iAs3+-induced cell toxicity, oxidative stress, and gut barrier dysfunction in the presence or absence of UroA. Here, we report that treatment with UroA attenuated iAs3+-induced cell toxicity, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in colon epithelial cells. Moreover, our data suggest that UroA significantly reduces iAs3+-induced gut barrier permeability and inflammatory markers in both colon epithelial cells and in a human intestinal 3D organoid model system. Mechanistically, UroA protected against iAs3+-induced disruption of tight junctional proteins in intestinal epithelial cells through blockade of oxidative stress and markers of inflammation. Taken together, our studies for the first time suggest that microbial metabolites such as UroA can potentially be used to protect against environmental hazards by reducing intestinal oxidative stress and by enhancing gut barrier function.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In degenerative intervertebral disc (IVD), an unfavorable IVD environment leads to increased senescence of nucleus pulposus (NP)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (NPMSCs) and the inability to complete the differentiation from NPMSCs to NP cells, leading to further aggravation of IVD degeneration (IDD). Urolithin A (UA) has been proven to have obvious effects in delaying cell senescence and resisting oxidative stress. AIM: To explore whether UA can alleviate NPMSCs senescence and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. METHODS: In vitro, we harvested NPMSCs from rat tails, and divided NPMSCs into four groups: the control group, H2O2 group, H2O2 + UA group, and H2O2 + UA + SR-18292 group. Senescence-associated β-Galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity, cell cycle, cell proliferation ability, and the expression of senescence-related and silent information regulator of transcription 1/PPAR gamma coactivator-1α (SIRT1/ PGC-1α) pathway-related proteins and mRNA were used to evaluate the protective effects of UA. In vivo, an animal model of IDD was constructed, and X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, and histological analysis were used to assess whether UA could alleviate IDD in vivo. RESULTS: We found that H2O2 can cause NPMSCs senescence changes, such as cell cycle arrest, reduced cell proliferation ability, increased SA-β-Gal activity, and increased expression of senescence-related proteins and mRNA. After UA pretreatment, the abovementioned senescence indicators were significantly alleviated. To further demonstrate the mechanism of UA, we evaluated the mitochondrial membrane potential and the SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway that regulates mitochondrial function. UA protected mitochondrial function and delayed NPMSCs senescence by activating the SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway. In vivo, we found that UA treatment alleviated an animal model of IDD by assessing the disc height index, Pfirrmann grade and the histological score. CONCLUSION: In summary, UA could activate the SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling pathway to protect mitochondrial function and alleviate cell senescence and IDD in vivo and vitro."

      "abstract": "Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction play critical role in the pathogenic process of Parkinson's disease (PD). Mitophagy plays central role in mitochondrial quality control. Hence, regulation of microglial activation through mitophagy could be a valuable strategy in controlling microglia-mediated neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Urolithin A (UA) is a natural compound produced by gut bacteria from ingested ellagitannins (ETs) and ellagic acid (EA). Several preclinical studies have reported the beneficial effects of UA on age-related conditions by increasing mitophagy and blunting excessive inflammatory responses. However, the specific role of UA in pathology of PD remains unknown. In this study, we showed that treatment with UA reduced the loss of dopaminergic neurons, ameliorated behavioral deficits and neuroinflammation in MPTP mouse model of PD. Further study revealed that UA promotes mitophagy, restores mitochondrial function and attenuate proinflammatory response in BV2 microglial cells exposed to LPS. Moreover, UA also reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activation both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, disruption of microglial mitophagy with pharmacological or genetic approach partly blunted the neuroprotective effects of UA in MPTP mouse model of PD. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence that UA protects against dopaminergic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. The mechanism may be related with its inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation via promoting mitophagy in microglia.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Aging is associated with a decline in mitochondrial function and reduced exercise capacity. Urolithin A is a natural gut microbiome-derived food metabolite that has been shown to stimulate mitophagy and improve muscle function in older animals and to induce mitochondrial gene expression in older humans. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether oral administration of urolithin A improved the 6-minute walk distance, muscle endurance in hand and leg muscles, and biomarkers associated with mitochondrial and cellular health. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial in adults aged 65 to 90 years was conducted at a medical center and a cancer research center in Seattle, Washington, from March 1, 2018, to July 30, 2020. Muscle fatigue tests and plasma analysis of biomarkers were assessed at baseline, 2 months, and 4 months. Six-minute walk distance and maximal ATP production were assessed using magnetic resonance spectroscopy at baseline and at the end of study at 4 months. The analysis used an intention-to-treat approach. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive daily oral supplementation with either 1000 mg urolithin A or placebo for 4 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was change from baseline in the 6-minute walk distance and change from baseline to 4 months in maximal ATP production in the hand skeletal muscle. The secondary end points were change in muscle endurance of 2 skeletal muscles (tibialis anterior [TA] in the leg and first dorsal interosseus [FDI] in the hand). Cellular health biomarkers were investigated via plasma metabolomics. Adverse events were recorded and compared between the 2 groups during the intervention period. RESULTS: A total of 66 participants were randomized to either the urolithin A (n = 33) or the placebo (n = 33) intervention group. These participants had a mean (SD) age of 71.7 (4.94) years, were predominantly women (50 [75.8%]), and were all White individuals. Urolithin A, compared with placebo, significantly improved muscle endurance (ie, increase in the number of muscle contractions until fatigue from baseline) in the FDI and TA at 2 months (urolithin A: FDI, 95.3 [115.5] and TA, 41.4 [65.5]; placebo: FDI, 11.6 [147.4] and TA, 5.7 [127.1]). Plasma levels of several acylcarnitines, ceramides, and C-reactive protein were decreased by urolithin A, compared with placebo, at 4 months (baseline vs 4 mo: urolithin A, 2.14 [2.15] vs 2.07 [1.46]; placebo, 2.17 [2.52] vs 2.65 [1.86]). The mean (SD) increase from baseline in the 6-minute walk distance was 60.8 (67.2) m in the urolithin A group and 42.5 (73.3) m in the placebo group. The mean (SD) change from baseline to 4 months in maximal ATP production in the FDI was 0.07 (0.23) mM/s in the urolithin A group and 0.06 (0.20) mM/s in the placebo group; for the TA, it was -0.03 (0.10) mM/s in the urolithin A group and 0.03 (0.10) mM/s in the placebo group. These results showed no significant improvement with urolithin A supplementation compared with placebo. No statistical differences in adverse events were observed between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial found that urolithin A supplementation was safe and well tolerated in the assessed population. Although the improvements in the 6-minute walk distance and maximal ATP production in the hand muscle were not significant in the urolithin A group vs the placebo group, long-term urolithin A supplementation was beneficial for muscle endurance and plasma biomarkers, suggesting that urolithin A may counteract age-associated muscle decline; however, future work is needed to confirm this finding.

The expression levels of p62 and Keap1 significantly decreased, while that of nuclear Nrf2 increased in vitro in a hypoxia cell model after UA treatment. Furthermore, the apoptosis of tubular cells was attenuated and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were reduced in the kidneys in a mouse RIR model after UA administration.

Recent reports have highlighted the protective role of urolithin A (UA), a gut metabolite produced from ellagic acid-containing foods such as pomegranates, berries and walnuts, in several neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease and ischemic stroke. However, the potential role of UA in PD has not been characterized. In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanisms for role of UA in 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity in cell cultures and mice model of PD. Our results revealed that UA protected against 6-OHDA cytotoxicity and apoptosis in PC12 cells. Meanwhile, administration of UA to 6-OHDA lesioned mice ameliorated both motor deficits and nigral-striatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity. More important, UA treatment significantly attenuated 6-OHDA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in PC12 cells accompanied by enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that UA exerts neuroprotective effects by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis via SIRT1-PGC-1α signaling pathway. Taken together, these data provide new insights into the novel role of UA in regulating mitochondrial dysfunction and suggest that UA may have potential therapeutic applications for PD.",

Apart from traditionally targeting amyloid beta (Aβ), the main culprit in AD brains, other approaches include investigating impaired mitochondrial pathways for potential therapeutic benefits against AD. Thus, a future therapy for AD may focus on novel candidates that enhance optimal mitochondrial integrity and turnover. Bioactive food components, known as nutraceuticals, may serve as such agents to combat AD. Urolithin A is an intestinal microbe-derived metabolite of a class of polyphenols, ellagitannins (ETs). Urolithin A is known to exert many health benefits. Its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic, anti-Aβ, and pro-mitophagy properties are increasingly recognized. However, the underlying mechanisms of urolithin A in inducing mitophagy is poorly understood. This review discusses the mitophagy deficits in AD and examines potential molecular mechanisms of its activation. Moreover, the current knowledge of urolithin A is discussed, focusing on its neuroprotective properties and its potential to induce mitophagy. Specifically, this review proposes potential mechanisms by which urolithin A may activate and promote mitophagy.",

Urolithin A (UA) possesses many pharmacological and biological activities, but its function in GBM is not clear. CCK-8 and colony formation test were used to measure the anti-proliferative potency of UA against GBM cells. Flow cytometry was applied to evaluate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of U251 and U118 MG cells upon UA incubation. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting were conducted to test the regulatory effect of UA on the expression of Sirt1 and FOXO1. Immunodeficient mice were implanted with GBM cells for in vivo validation of the anti-cancer effect of UA. We found UA repressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of glioblastoma cells, while also inhibiting the induction of colony formation ability and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in a time- or dose-dependent manner. The does-dependent relationship of UA inducing the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of glioblastoma cells was identified. Furthermore, UA could enhance the expression levels of Sirt1 and FOXO1 and the knockdown of Sirt1 blocked the inhibitory effects of UA on the proliferation and migration of glioblastoma cells and correspondingly modified the expression level of FOXO1. Overexpression of Sirt1 restored the despaired inhibitory effect of UA induced by Sirt1 knockout on the proliferation and migration of glioblastoma cells. In animal experiments, UA decreased the tumor size and weight of glioblastoma in xenograft nude mice and promoted the expression of Sirt1 and FOXO1 in transplanted tumors. Our findings presented in this study indicate that UA exerts a repressive effect on glioblastoma cells in vivo and in vitro by regulating the Sirt1-FOXO1 axis via the ERK and AKT pathways, indicating that UA is a new novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of glioblastoma.",

      "abstract": "Objective To investigate the effect and mechanism of urolithin A (UA) on the inflammation and lipid accumulation induced by hyperlipidemia in L02 hepatocytes. Methods Nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentivirus was used to establish a stable Nrf2 knockdown cell line in L02 cells. Empty vector control cells and Nrf2 knockdown cells were treated with free fatty acids (FFAs) or bovine serum albumin (BSA) to establish the hyperlipidemic cell model, and Urolithin A was treated on this basis. Specifically, they were divided into control group (BSA treatment), FFA treatment group (0.6 mmol/L), FFA (0.6 mmol/L) combined with UA low-dose group (10 μmol/L) and FFA (0.6 mmol/L) combined with UA high-dose group (20 μmol/L). All of these groups were treated for 48 h. The dye of BODIPY493/503 was used to detect the accumulation of lipid droplets in the cell. The levels of triglyceride (TG) was detected by TG assay kit. TNF-α and IL-6 in the supernatant of the cells were detected by ELISA. The level of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected by flow cytometry combined with DCFH-DA. Malondialdehyde (MDA) kit was used to test the level of MDA. Total superoxide dismutase (SOD) kit and catalase (CAT) kit were used to detect the activities of total SOD and CAT, respectively. The mRNA levels of SOD2 and CAT were detected by real-time quantitative PCR. The protein levels of SOD2, CAT, Nrf2 as well as P62, LC3 were detected by Western blot analysis. The adenovirus of RFP-GFP-LC3 was used to measure the autophagy flux in the cells. Results FFA increased the levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and TG as well as the positive rate of BODIPY493/503 staining in L02 cells. The levels of MDA and ROS increased, while the mRNA and protein expressions of SOD2, CAT and Nrf2 decreased when treated with FFA. FFA treatment also suppressed the levels of autophagy markers LC33-II and promoted the level of P62, and blocked autophagy flux. UA treatment could reverse the above effects of FFA, with significant difference. When Nrf2 was knocked down, the above effects of UA disappeared. Conclusion Through activating autophagy and antioxidative pathways which are mediated by Nrf2 pathway, urolithin A alleviates inflammation and oxidative stress induced by high lipid in L02 hepatocytes.",

METHODS: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated from mice and incubated with urolithin A (UA) (10, 25, and 50 µg/mL). 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed to estimate apoptosis and mineralisation was evaluated by alkaline phosphatase assay and alizarin red S staining. A middle femoral defect was induced in mice and bone tissue was prepared for endochondral ossification by treating with UA. The effect of UA was estimated by determining markers of osteoblast proliferation in serum and micro-computed tomography to analyse bone defects. RESULTS: UA enhanced mineralisation of MSCs and osteogenic gene markers in MSCs in vitro. Also, the bone defect score and bone mineral density were improved by UA. Moreover, UA ameliorated the altered Wnt3a protein and histopathological changes in bone defect mice. CONCLUSION: Presented report conclude that UA enhances osteoblast proliferation in bone-defect mice by activating the Wnt pathway.",

      "abstract": "(1) Background: Ellagitannins are natural products occurring in pomegranate and walnuts. They are hydrolyzed in the gut to release ellagic acid, which is further metabolized by the microflora into urolithins, such as urolithin A (UA). Accumulation of damaged mitochondria is a hallmark of aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective activity of the metabolite UA against mitochondrial dysfunction in a cellular model of early Alzheimer disease (AD). (2) Methods: In the present study we used SH-SY5Y-APP695 cells and its corresponding controls (SH-SY5Ymock) to assess UA's effect on mitochondrial function. Using these cells we investigated mitochondrial respiration (OXPHOS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, autophagy and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells treated with UA. Furthermore, we assessed UA's effect on the expression of genes related to mitochondrial bioenergetics, mitochondrial biogenesis, and autophagy via quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). (3) Results: Treatment of SH-SY5Y-APP695 cells suggests changes to autophagy corresponding with qRT-PCR results. However, LC3B-I, LC3B-II, and p62 levels were unchanged. UA (10 µM) reduced MMP, and ATP-levels. Treatment of cells with UA (1 µM) for 24 h did not affect ROS production or levels of Aβ, but significantly increased expression of genes for mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS. Mitochondrial Transcription Factor A (TFAM) expression was specifically increased in SH-SY5Y-APP695. Both cell lines showed unaltered levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α), which is commonly associated with mitochondrial biogenesis. Results imply that biogenesis might be facilitated by estrogen-related receptor (ESRR) genes. (4) Conclusion: Urolithin A shows no effect on autophagy in SH-SY5Y-APP695 cells and its effect on mitochondrial function is limited. Instead, data suggests that UA treatment induces hormetic effects as it induces transcription of several genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis.",

Urolithin A (UA) is a natural metabolite with pro-apoptotic and antioxidant effects, capable of preventing the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria in different aged cells. UA has never been tested in bovine oocytes. Our aim was to study the effect of UA on the developmental potential of cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs) and granulosa cells' (GCs) expression of important genes related to reproductive competence. Nuclear maturation progression, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and developmental competence of physiologically mature (22 h) and in vitro aged oocytes (30 h of IVM) obtained from prepubertal and adult females, either supplemented with UA or not were assessed. Additionally, the amount of mRNA of several genes (NFE2L2, NQO1, and mt-DN5) and the number of mt-ND5 DNA copies were quantified in cultured GCs from prepubertal and adult females, either supplemented with UA or not. Our study confirmed the harmful effect of oocyte aging on the nuclear maturation progression, MMP, developmental competence and gene expression levels. UA treatment during in vitro maturation enhanced (p < 0.05) the maturation rate and subsequent developmental capacity of aged oocytes. A positive effect (p < 0.05) of UA on physiological maturation, MMP and embryonic development was also identified. UA also interfered on the expression profile of NFE2L2 and NQO1 genes in GCs cultures. Our findings demonstrate that UA supplementation is an effective way to prevent oocyte aging and improves the subsequent bovine embryonic development."

      "abstract": "Physiological mechanical stimulation has been shown to promote chondrogenesis, but excessive mechanical loading results in cartilage degradation. Currently, the underlying mechanotransduction pathways in the context of physiological and injurious loading are not fully understood. In this study, we aim to identify the critical factors that dictate chondrocyte response to mechanical overloading, as well as to develop therapeutics that protect chondrocytes from mechanical injuries. Specifically, human chondrocytes were loaded in hyaluronic hydrogel and then subjected to dynamic compressive loading under 5% (DL-5% group) or 25% strain (DL-25% group). Compared to static culture and DL-5%, DL-25% reduced cartilage matrix formation from chondrocytes, which was accompanied by the increased senescence level, as revealed by higher expression of p21, p53, and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal). Interestingly, mitophagy was suppressed by DL-25%, suggesting a possible role for the restoration mitophagy in reducing cartilage degeneration with mechanical overloading. Next, we treated the mechanically overloaded samples (DL-25%) with Urolithin A (UA), a natural metabolite previously shown to enhance mitophagy in other cell types. qRT-PCR, histology, and immunostaining results confirmed that UA treatment significantly increased the quantity and quality of cartilage matrix deposition. Interestingly, UA also suppressed the senescence level induced by mechanical overloading, demonstrating its senomorphic potential. Mechanistic analysis confirmed that UA functioned partially by enhancing mitophagy. In summary, our results show that mechanical overloading results in cartilage degradation partially through the impairment of mitophagy. This study also identifies UA's novel use as a compound that can protect chondrocytes from mechanical injuries, supporting high-quality cartilage formation/maintenance."

Here, we assessed the potential antileukemic activities of both urolithin A and urolithin B. Results showed that both urolithin A and B significantly inhibited the proliferation of leukemic cell lines Jurkat and K562, among which urolithin A showed the more prominent antiproliferative capability. Further, urolithin treatment alters leukemic cell metabolism, as evidenced by increased metabolic rate and notable changes in glutamine metabolism, one-carbon metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Next, we evidenced that both urolithins equally promoted apoptosis in leukemic cell lines. Based on these observations, we concluded that both urolithin A and B alter leukemic cell metabolome, resulting in a halt of proliferation, followed by apoptosis.

      "abstract": "STUDY QUESTION: What are the effects of plant-derived antioxidant compounds urolithin A (UA) and B (UB) on the growth and pathogenetic properties of an in vitro endometriosis model? SUMMARY ANSWER: Both urolithins showed inhibitory effects on cell behavior related to the development of endometriosis by differentially affecting growth, adhesion, motility, and invasion of endometriotic cells in vitro. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Endometriosis is one of the most common benign gynecological diseases in women of reproductive age and is defined by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. As current pharmacological therapies are associated with side effects interfering with fertility, we aimed at finding alternative therapeutics using natural compounds that can be administered for prolonged periods with a favorable side effects profile. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: In vitro cultures of primary endometriotic stromal cells from 6 patients subjected to laparoscopy for benign pathologies with histologically confirmed endometriosis; and immortalized endometrial stromal (St-T1b) and endometriotic epithelial cells (12Z) were utilized to assess the effects of UA and UB on endometriotic cell properties. Results were validated in three-dimensional (3D) in vitro co-culture spheroids of 12Z and primary endometriotic stroma cells of one patient, and organoids from 3 independent donors with endometriosis. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The effects on cell growth were measured by non-radioactive colorimetric assay to measure cellular metabolic activity as an indicator of cell viability (MTT assay) and flow cytometric cell cycle assay on primary cultures, St-T1b, and 12Z. Apoptosis analyses, the impact on in vitro adhesion, migration, and invasion were evaluated in the cell lines. Moreover, Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays were performed on primary cultures, St- T1b and 12Z to evaluate a plausible mechanistic contribution by factors related to proteolysis (matrix metalloproteinase 2, 3 and 9 -MMP2, MMP3, MMP9-, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases -TIMP-1-), cytoskeletal regulators (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 -RAC1-, Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 -ROCK2-), and cell adhesion molecules (Syndecan 1 -SDC1-, Integrin alpha V-ITGAV-). Finally, the urolithins effects were evaluated on spheroids and organoids by formation, viability, and drug screen assays. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: 40 µM UA and 20 µM UB produced a significant decrease in cell proliferation in the primary endometriotic cell cultures (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively) and in the St-T1b cell line (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). In St-T1b, UA exhibited a mean half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 39.88 µM, while UB exhibited a mean IC50 of 79.92 µM. Both 40 µM UA and 20 µM UB produced an increase in cells in the S phase of the cell cycle (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). The same concentration of UA also increased the percentage of apoptotic ST-t1b cells (P < 0.05), while both urolithins decreased cell migration after 24 h (P < 0.001 both). Only the addition of 5 µM UB decreased the number of St-T1b adherent cells. TIMP-1 expression was upregulated in response to treating the cells with 40 µM UA (P < 0.05). Regarding the 12Z endometriotic cell line, only 40 µM UA decreased proliferation (P < 0.01); while both 40 µM UA and 20 µM UB produced an increase in cells in the G2/M phase (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). In this cell line, UA exhibited a mean IC50 of 40.46 µM, while UB exhibited a mean IC50 of 54.79 µM. UB decreased cell migration (P < 0.05), and decreased the number of adherent cells (P < 0.05). Both 40 µM UA and 20 µM UB significantly decreased the cellular invasion of these cells; and several genes were altered when treating the cells with 40 µM UA and 10 µM UB. The expression of MMP2 was downregulated by UA (P < 0.001), and expression of MMP3 (UA P < 0.001 and UB P < 0.05) and MMP9 (P < 0.05, both) were downregulated by both urolithins. Moreover, UA significantly downregulated ROCK2 (P < 0.05), whereas UB treatment was associated with RAC1 downregulation (P < 0.05). Finally, the matrix adhesion receptors and signaling (co)receptors SDC1 and ITGAV were downregulated upon treatment with either UA or UB (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively in both cases). Regarding the effects of urolithins on 3D models, we have seen that they significantly decrease the viability of endometriosis spheroids (80 µM UA and UB: P < 0.05 both) as well as affecting their area (40 µM UA: P < 0.05, and 80 µM UA: P < 0.01) and integrity (40 µM UA and UB: P < 0.05, 80 µM UA and UB: P < 0.01). On the other hand, UA and UB significantly inhibited organoid development/outgrowth (40 and 80 µM UA: P < 0.0001 both; 40 µM UB: P < ns-0.05-0.001, and 80 µM UB: P < 0.01-0.001-0.001), and all organoid lines show urolithins sensitivity resulting in decreasing viability (UA exhibited a mean IC50 of 33.93 µM, while UB exhibited a mean IC50 of 52.60 µM). LARGE-SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study was performed on in vitro endometriosis models. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These in vitro results provide new insights into the pathogenetic pathways affected by these compounds and mark their use as a potential new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of endometriosis. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This study was funded EU MSCA-RISE-2015 project MOMENDO (691058). The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.",

UroA is of growing interest due to its therapeutic potential for various metabolic diseases based on immunomodulatory properties. Recent advances in UroA research suggest that UroA administration attenuates inflammation in various tissues, including the brain, adipose, heart, and liver tissues, leading to the potential delay or prevention of the onset of Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In this review, we focus on recent updates of the anti-inflammatory function of UroA and summarize the potential mechanisms by which UroA may help attenuate the onset of diseases in a tissue-specific manner. Therefore, this review aims to shed new insights into UroA as a potent anti-inflammatory molecule to prevent immunometabolic diseases, either by dietary intervention with ellagic acid-rich food or by UroA administration as a new pharmaceutical drug."
