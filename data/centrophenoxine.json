      "abstract": "Oxidative stress has been implicated in the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). The important biochemical features of PD, being profound deficit in dopamine (DA) content, reduced glutathione (GSH), and enhanced lipid peroxidation (LPO) in dopaminergic (DA-ergic) neurons resulting in oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Rotenone-induced neurotoxicity is a well acknowledged preclinical model for studying PD in rodents as it produces selective DA-ergic neuronal degeneration. In our previous study, we have shown that chronic administration of rotenone to rats is able to produce motor dysfunction, which increases progressively with rotenone treatment and centrophenoxine (CPH) co-treatment is able to attenuate these motor defects. The present study was carried out to evaluate the antioxidant potential of CPH against rotenone-induced oxidative stress. Chronic administration of rotenone to SD rats resulted in marked oxidative damage in the midbrain region compared to other regions of the brain and CPH co-treatment successfully attenuated most of these changes. CPH significantly attenuated rotenone-induced depletion in DA, GSH and increase in LPO levels. In addition, the drug prevented the increase in nitric oxide (NO) and citrulline levels and also enhanced the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Histological analysis carried out using hematoxylin and eosin staining has indicated severe damage to mid brain in comparison to cortex and cerebellum and this damage is attenuated by CPH co-treatment. Our results strongly indicate the possible therapeutic potential of centrophenoxine as an antioxidant in Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders where oxidative stress is a key player in the disease process.",

      "abstract": "Rotenone, a potent specific inhibitor of mitochondrial complex-1, appears to reproduce the behavioral features of Parkinson's disease in rats. It destroys dopaminergic neurons selectively, causing deficiency of dopamine in striatum which leads to impaired motor functions. Oxidative stress generated as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolism of dopamine has been implicated as an important factor in the etiology of Parkinson's disease. Present study explores the potential of centrophenoxine (a well known anti-aging and antioxidant drug) against rotenone induced motor dysfunction. Sprague Dawley male rats were administered with rotenone on a daily basis by subcutaneous injection of dose: 2 mg/kg body weight over a period of 35 days. Data showed impaired motor function, significant increase in catalepsy, decrease in locomotor activity and decrease in muscle activity. Dopamine content of rotenone treated animals was found to decrease significantly and lipid peroxidation was found to increase significantly in rotenone treated animals when compared with co-treated group. Co-treatment with centrophenoxine (100 mg/kg i.p. for 35 days) significantly attenuated the extent of motor dysfunction and changes in the level of dopamine and lipid peroxidation induced by rotenone toxicity. Thus, the present study provides evidence that centrophenoxine co-treatment attenuates rotenone induced motor dysfunction by virtue of its antioxidant action.",

In this light, the present study is focused on the role of aluminium in mediating oxidative stress, which may help in better understanding its role in neuronal degeneration. Further, we have exploited a known anti-aging drug centrophenoxine to explore its potential in the conditions of metal induced oxidative damage. Aluminium was administered orally at a dose level of 100 mg/kg b.wt./day for a period of 6 weeks followed by a post treatment of centrophenoxine at a dose level of 100 mg/kg b.wt./day for another 6 weeks. Following aluminium exposure, a significant increase in lipid peroxidation levels (estimated by MDA) were observed which was accompanied by a decrease in reduced glutathione content in both cerebrum and cerebellum of rat brain. Post treatment of centrophenoxine significantly reduced the lipid peroxidation levels and also increased the reduced glutathione content in both the regions. Histologically observed marked deteriorations in the organization of various cellular layers in both cerebrum and cerebellum were observed after aluminium administration. Centrophenoxine treated animals showed an appreciable improvement in the histoarchitecture of the cellular layers. Our results indicate that centrophenoxine has an antioxidant potential and should be examined further in aluminium toxic conditions.",

One of the nootropic drug centrophenoxine, also known as an anti-aging drug has been exploited in the present experiment under aluminium toxic conditions. Aluminium was administered by oral gavage at a dose level of 100 mg/Kg x b x wt/day for a period of six weeks. To elucidate the region specific response, study was carried out in two different regions of brain namely cerebrum and cerebellum. Following aluminium exposure, a significant decrease in the activities of enzymes namely Hexokinase, Lactate dehydrogenase, Succinate dehydrogenase, Mg(2+) dependent ATPase was observed in both the regions. Moreover, the activity of acetylcholinesterase was also reported to be significantly decreased. Post-treatment with centrophenoxine was able to restore the altered enzyme activities and the effect was observed in both the regions of brain although the activity of lactate dehydrogenase and acetylcholinesterase did not register significant increase in the cerebellum region. Further, centrophenoxine was able to improve the altered short-term memory and cognitive performance resulted from aluminium exposure. From the present study, it can be concluded that centrophenoxine has a potential and can be exploited in other toxicological conditions also.",

      "abstract": "Aluminium is one of the most studied neurotoxin, and its effects on nervous system are both structural and functional, involving various regions of brain. Aluminium toxicity is known to have multiple mechanisms of action in the central nervous system. Affinity of aluminium for thiol substrates is considered a possible molecular mechanism involved in aluminium neurotoxicity. The reduced glutathione (GSH) is especially important for cellular defence against aluminium toxicity. This study pertains to the modulatory action of centrophenoxine on GSH status in aluminium exposed different brain regions of the female rats. Aluminium was administered orally at a dose of 40 mg/Kg x b x wt x /day for a period of eight weeks whereas, centrophenoxine was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 100 mg/Kg x b x wt x /day for a period of six weeks. The study was carried out in different regions of brain namely cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla oblongata and hypothalamus. Animals exposed to aluminum, registered a significant decrease in the levels of reduced glutathione, and oxidized glutathione as well as in the activity of glutathione reductase in all the different regions studied when compared to normal control animals. Post-treatment with centrophenoxine, showed a significant improvement in the thiol levels in different regions. Centrophenoxine when administered alone also had a profound effect on the levels of reduced glutathione as well as on the activity of glutathione reductase. From the present results, it can be stated that centrophenoxine administration, as a thiol-antioxidant, arrests the aluminium induced cellular damage by improving the thiol status in brain regions.",

      "abstract": "The present study was carried out to investigate the potential of centrophenoxine in modulating aluminium-induced neurotoxicity. Female Sprague Dawley rats were administered aluminium chloride orally (40 mg/kg b.w./day) for a period of 8 weeks. At the end of respective treatment, various markers of oxidative stress were determined in four different regions of brain: cerebrum cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and hypothalamus. Lipid peroxidation assay was also carried out using standard techniques. Simultaneously, the centrophenoxine group (100 mg/kg b.w./day) for 6 weeks was also run long to understand the role in ameliorating oxidative damage. A significant decrease in the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase was noticed in all the four regions, the most significant being in the hypothalamus (0.603 +/- .06) and cerebrum (0.038 +/- .01). Due to aluminium toxicity, peroxidation of lipids was also found to be elevated in cerebrum (0.424 +/- .03), cerebellum (0.341 +/- .03), hypothalamus (1.018 +/- .007), and medulla oblongata (0.304 +/- .05). However, posttreatment with centrophenoxine significantly elevated the superoxide and catalase activities in different regions. In addition, lipid peroxidation status of membranes was significantly reduced after centrophenoxine posttreatment to aluminium-exposed animals. Centrophenoxine has proved to be beneficial in combating the damage caused by aluminium toxicity. However, further research is needed to have a better understanding of the molecular basis of aluminium-induced oxidative damage. In addition, the different aspects of centrophenoxine need to be unmasked."

The age-dependent decrease in the enzyme activity first appeared in the hippocampus; the brain stem was affected later while the cerebellum remained unaffected. Centrophenoxine, usually considered as an ageing reversal drug and also regarded as a neuroenergeticum in human therapy, increased the acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus of aged rats, the activity was also elevated in the brain stem but no in the cerebellum. The acetylcholinesterase-stimulating influence of the drug is likely to be implicated in the pharmacological reversal of the age related decline of the cholinergic system.

After 8 weeks the laboratory tests were repeated again. The randomization code for verum or placebo treatment was revealed only after completing the trial. Four dropouts occurred during the treatment period. The total body water, extracellular water volume and exchangable Na(+) were determined by means of radioisotope methods. Plasma volume (PV) was measured by indocyanine-green dilution test. Body weights were also recorded. From the above data further parameters could be calculated. Serum lipid data as well as several hormone levels were also checked in the blood samples. The main results were better performance in psychometric tests (Pék et al., 1989) and a significant increase of the average intracellular water content (2.2-2.5% by weight) in the verum-treated group. The rehydration of the intracellular mass due to CPH treatment is consistent with the OH(*.) free radical scavenger properties of CPH and the predictions of the membrane hypothesis of aging."

During the treatment period four drop-outs occurred for intercurrent diseases. Evaluation was based on a semi-quantitative, intra-individual comparison of the performance before and after treatment. The results obtained suggest that CPH treatment may be useful in dementias of medium level in quite old groups of patients, since 48% of the verum group displayed improvements in the memory functions against 28% of the placebo group.

It has been previously shown that D displays a significant negative linear age correlation. The in vivo effects of two drugs were tested on this parameter. Young (2.7 months) and old (24-26 months) male rats received centrophenoxine (CPH) or a new drug (BCE-001) by either intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or per os through a gastric tube for 26 to 42 days. D was measured on a double-blind basis in the hepatocyte plasma membrane of treated and control groups. The CPH and BCE-001 treatments did not affect the value of D in the young rats. However, the latter drug increased their growth rate. An increase of D in old animals was induced by treatment with either drug. When the drug effects in old rats were compared, BCE-001 proved to be more efficient than CPH, and at the same time was able to significantly retard the age-dependent loss of body weight characteristic of these animals at the age of approximately 2 years. Our results are in good accord with the predictions of the membrane hypothesis of aging as regards the role of properly placed OH. free radical scavengers in the improvement of membrane and overall cell function.",

Four of the animals received 80 mg/kg Centrophenoxine (IM injection) daily for 12 weeks. No significant difference between the treated and control groups could be demonstrated statistically (Mann-Whitney U-test) either in the fraction of RPE cell cytoplasm occupied by lipofuscin granules or in the average size of the granules.",

The molecular weight distribution showed an age-dependence: there was a clear shift toward the higher molecular weights in the adult and old rats. The observed alterations reflect an increased cross-linking of the proteins during aging due most probably to the OH free radical damage of the cell components. Centrophenoxine treatment for 2 months reversed this phenomenon in the old animals: the high molecular weight fractions decreased and the lower ones increased in the treated animals as compared to the old, untreated rats. The results support the membrane hypothesis of aging and contribute to a better understanding of the biological effects of centrophenoxine.",

Two other groups of untreated mice of the same age served as controls. Receptor affinity showed no statistically significant changes in the four different groups investigated. As regards the receptor density, an increasing trend has been elicited between the 5-day treated mice and their controls; however, the increase was not statistically significant. The second group of old mice treated with centrophenoxine for 40 days exhibited a statistically significant increase in receptor density when compared with untreated animals. The modulation of beta-adrenoceptor density may be explained as the result of either a direct action on synaptic structure or an indirect effect mediated by thyroid hormones.",

The purity of the fractions was tested by transmission electron microscopy and marker enzyme assays. The cholesterol content of the fractions was also determined. Samples of the fractions were labelled with diphenylhexatriene (DPH) and the fluorescence anisotropy (r) of the label was measured at various optical densities. The values of r extrapolated to zero optical density were compared in the age groups and used for calculating the 'microviscosity' of the membranes. The 'microviscosity' of synaptosomal membranes displayed a significant age-dependent increase: from 2.3 +/- 0.02 (SD) in the young group it increased to 2.6 +/- 0.03 poise by the age of 24 mth at 37 degrees C. Most of this increase occurred between the adult and old age. The cholesterol content of the synaptosomes also increased significantly during aging. Centrophenoxine (CPH)-treatment with 100 mg/kg body weight daily dose for 2 mth was able to reverse the age-dependent alterations of both the membrane 'microviscosity' and the cholesterol content in the synaptosomes: the values returned nearly to the adult level. The results obtained are interpreted in terms of the membrane hypothesis of aging attributing to primary role to the free-radical induced membrane damage in cellular aging.",

Age-dependent alterations have been revealed from 3 to 28 mth of age, and the effect of centrophenoxine (CPH) was analyzed in two different patterns of administration. First, 27-mth-old rats were treated daily for 6 wk (acute treatment), and second, 18-mth-old rats were treated 3 times per week for 5 months (chronic treatment). The dose was 100 mg CPH/kg body weight, injected intraperitoneally. The surface density (SV), the numerical density (NV) and the average length (L) of the synaptic junctions were calculated from data obtained on ethanol-phosphotungstic acid stained ultrathin sections. An age-dependent reduction of SV and NV of the synaptic contact zones was found, and the L increased in the oldest animals. CPH-treatment resulted in a marked increase of SV in both types of application, whereas the other two parameters behaved differently in the two groups. The chronic treatment resulted in a significant slowing down of the decrease of NV, whereas L remained invariate. On the contrary, the acute treatment increased L but did not alter significantly NV. The results and the differences between the treatment types are discussed in terms of synaptic plasticity and are interpreted as different manifestations of the same reactive synaptogenetic process.",

This treatment resulted in a sort of \"rejuvenation\" of synaptic structures. Namely, the surface density and the total length of synaptic contact zones were markedly reduced in the untreated old group, but in the treated animals these parameters returned to the values found in the young and adult animals. At the same time the numerical density of synapses remained unaltered in the treated group, while the average synaptic length displayed some further increase.

The mechanism of the lipofuscin accumulation and the function of lipofuscin in the aging cell is not fully understood. The accumulation of lipofuscin in vivo and in vitro can be slowed down by the action of centrophenoxine (Helfergin). Diploid cells are the only reversible postmitotic cells of man that have a genetically determined limited cell division capacity and accumulate lipofuscin in the process of the cellular aging in a quantitative cell culture system in vitro. The treatment of diploid human glia cells with centrophenoxine results in increasing the cell division capacity by 30--40% in vitro. The data demonstrate that the centrophenoxine induced inhibition of lipofuscin accumulation has a positive influence on the cell metabolism and the mitotic division capacity and causes a delay of the cellular aging of the human glia cells in vitro.",

All rats, treated with centrophenoxine, remained alive and recovered quickly from the intoxication while four of the control animals died, but in the remaining alive animals the recovery was very slow. Only four of the mice treated with centrophenoxine died, but in the remaining alive mice the signs of intoxication disappeared quickly. Twelve of the control animals died, but the remaining animals recovered very quickly. The obtained results corresponded to the favourable effect of centophenoxine, observed by us, in treatment of persons, intoxicated by diazepam.",

Two hours later, on the background of advanced intoxication, manifested by adynamia ataxia, lateral position, somnolence reaching stupor, the author administered in half of the animals (10) per os centrophenaxine in a dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight. The signs of intoxication disappeared for 24 hours after treatment with centrophenoxine. Three of the control animals died, but in the remaining rats the intoxication worsened, but then slowly disappeared till the end of the fifth day. The obtained experimental data supported the observations of the clinical practice on the favourable effect of centrophenoxine in the treatment of acute poisonings with chlordiazepoxide.",
