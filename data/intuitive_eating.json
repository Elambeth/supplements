      "abstract": "Intuitive and mindful eating are included in the current literature as two adaptable, current, and positive eating styles. This descriptive-cross-sectional study included 689 university students. The questionnaire form consists of the nutritional habits and anthropometric measurements of university students, \"Mindful Eating Questionnaire (MEQ)\", \"Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2)\", \"Eating Attitudes Test-Short Form (EAT-26)\", and the \"International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF)\". About 70.4% of participants with a mean age of 19.76 ± 1.32 years were classified as \"normal\" according to BMI; the mean BMI was 21.9 ± 3.2 kg/m2. IES-2 and MEQ scores of overweight/obese students are lower than those of underweight and normal-weight students (p < 0.01). A strong negative correlation exists between BMI, MEQ (r = -.134), IES-2 (r = -.353), and IPAQ-SF (r = -.127), and a strong positive correlation with EAT-26 (r = .209; p < 0.01). Standardized coefficients in the path model between IES and BMI (β= -0.314, R = -.167, p < 0.01), EAT (β= -0.221, R = -3.32, p < 0.01), MEQ (β = 0.304, R = 0.188, p < 0.01) indicate that intuitive eating significantly affects the BMI, eating attitudes, and mindful eating. Intuitive eating and mindful eating may be a promising, holistic, and long-term treatment approach for future health professionals by integrating traditional body weight management strategies."

Using data from the Aviitam platform in France, this study aimed to do the following: 1) explore psychological and behavioral patterns through clustering techniques; 2) validate the robustness of these clusters; and 3) assess their association with weight-loss outcomes in severe obesity under semaglutide treatment. METHODS: Phase 1 included 989 adults with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 who completed validated questionnaires, including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2). Phase 2 validated robustness in 492 individuals. Phase 3 applied clusters to 125 individuals with BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 who were treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg/week at Montpellier University Hospital, assessing weight-loss trajectories over 12 months. RESULTS: The following two clusters were identified: the Intuitive Eaters Group (IEG, n = 482); and the Emotionally Driven Eaters Group (EDEG, n = 507). The IEG exhibited lower emotional distress and higher intuitive eating scores. HADS and IES-2 distinguished clusters effectively (area under the curve, 0.95). Robustness was confirmed in Phase 2. In Phase 3, the IEG demonstrated a significantly more favorable weight-loss trajectory compared to the EDEG (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Psychological and behavioral clusters identified through HADS and IES-2 are associated with weight loss under semaglutide treatment, suggesting the value of integrating psychological and behavioral profiling into obesity care.",

Adaptive approaches designed to improve intuitive eating may improve dietary behaviours in people with SMI. Aims of this study were to investigate predictors of, and assess the impact of a nutrition program on, intuitive eating in people with SMI. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of an exercise and nutrition program for people with SMI. The primary outcome was intuitive eating assessed using the Intuitive Eating Scale 2 (IES2); psychological distress was measured using the Kessler-6 scale. Regression analyses were conducted on baseline data; change in intuitive eating was assessed using Wilcoxon tests. RESULTS: A total of 93 participants had complete data for regression analyses, and 32 completed pre/post-assessments. The most common mental health diagnosis was psychotic disorder (35%); 74% had BMI > 25 kg/m2. The regression model significantly predicted total IES2 score and three intuitive eating domains. Body mass index (BMI) was negatively associated with these outcomes (β = -0.234 to -0.248; p < 0.05). Both BMI and psychological distress were negatively associated with body-food choice congruence (B-FCC), and only B-FCC was improved at post-intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Higher BMI and psychological distress were associated with lower intuitive eating in people with SMI. Nutrition interventions may improve B-FCC in people with SMI. SO WHAT?: Given the interrelatedness of BMI and psychological distress with psychosocial stressors, nutritional interventions should be implemented alongside holistic approaches to improve health equality.",

      "abstract": "Screen use while eating has been recently identified as a highly common and potentially important specific setting of screen use in relation to eating disorder symptomatology. However, given this area of research is still in its infancy, how screen use while eating may be related to eating disorder symptomatology remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, the present study probed the potential roles of mindfulness and intuitive eating in the association between screen use while eating and eating disorder symptomatology. A large sample of Chinese adults (N = 800, aged 18-67 years old) recruited through a Chinese survey platform, Credamo, completed questionnaires assessing screen use while eating, eating disorder symptomatology, mindfulness, and intuitive eating. Structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed model. Results confirmed our hypotheses that the association between screen use while eating and eating disorder symptomatology was partially explained by mindfulness and intuitive eating, after adjusting for covariates (e.g., gender, age, body mass index, total screen time, and social media use). That said, higher screen use while eating was associated first with lower mindfulness and then with lower intuitive eating, which in turn were related to higher eating disorder symptomatology. The findings underline the importance of including eating-specific screen use for future research on eating disorder symptomatology and also have implications for an integrative intervention of mindfulness-based approaches and intuitive eating for mitigating the adverse effects of excessive screen use on eating behaviors.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the association between intuitive eating and health outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes in a cross-sectional study. METHODS: Consecutively, outpatients attending at university hospital underwent clinical, laboratory, lifestyle, and eating behavior evaluations. Intuitive eating was assessed using the Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2), and the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire-21 was adopted as a confirmatory tool for disordered eating behavior. Optimized health outcomes were considered according to the American Diabetes Association criteria for BMI, HbA1c, lipid profile, and blood pressure values, and the International Diabetes Federation criteria for waist circumference. Considering the answers of the IES-2 items, patients were grouped by latent class analysis, and their characteristics were compared by appropriate tests. RESULTS: In total, 267 patients were evaluated: 62.2% women, with 60 (53-65) years, BMI 31.9 ± 5.4 kg/m², diabetes duration of 16 ± 9 years, HbA1c 8.5 ± 1.5%, and an IES-2 total score of 58 (50-67)%. Three intuitive eating groups were identified: higher intuitive eating, nonemotional-oriented coping, and lower intuitive eating. Patients with higher intuitive eating have higher chances of having optimized BMI and serum triglycerides values compared to patients with lower intuitive eating. Also, the 10-point increase on IES-2 was associated with a 0.62 kg/m² reduction on BMI values (95%CI -1.18;-0.06), 1.90 cm on waist circumference (95%CI -3.26;-0.54), and 23 mg/dL in serum triglycerides values (95%CI -38.27;-7.40) after adjustment for age, sex, psychotropic drug use, medication effect score, smoking, and BMI. CONCLUSION: Intuitive eating seems to be associated with optimized health outcomes and may contribute to better personalized interventions in nutritional treatment that promote adaptive behaviors in diabetes management, but should be tested.",

This study sought to extend this work by assessing the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a 5-week IE intervention, \"Your Body is Your Home,\" delivered in school classrooms for early adolescents aged 11-13. METHODS: The present study utilized a quasi-experimental design. Eligibility criteria were defined a priori and published in a registered protocol. Four classrooms (n = 128 student participants) were recruited into two streams, and self-report questionnaires were administered at pre-test, post-test, and 4-week follow-up. The questionnaires included the Intuitive Eating Scale for Early Adolescents (IES-2-EA), the Body Appreciation Scale (BAS-2), and the WHO Wellbeing Index (WHO-5). Linear mixed models were used to conduct preliminary efficacy testing. RESULTS: The results indicate that a brief classroom-based IE intervention is feasible and acceptable for both students and teaching staff; retention, fidelity, and attendance targets were achieved. Students and teachers rated all five sessions of the intervention as a highly feasible method of health promotion. Further, preliminary efficacy data suggest IE interventions aimed at early adolescents may be a feasible way of improving certain aspects of IE (p < .001) in male and female participants, and body appreciation (p < .001) in male participants. DISCUSSION: The study provides preliminary support for the implementation and evaluation of an IE intervention as part of school-based health promotion and offers preliminary effect size estimates for a larger-scale randomized trial. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Existing evidence suggests that IE may be a useful framework through which relationships with food and the body can be improved. The present study seeks to extend this work by adapting the framework for early adolescents (among whom the framework is not well understood) and examining feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary changes to several health and well-being metrics following a 5-week school-based intervention.",

METHODS: The present study is a pilot/feasibility study of a 3-month, virtual, weight-inclusive, intuitive eating-based workplace wellness program. Program participants (n = 114), who were all employees at a large public university in the Midwest, received weekly emails with a link to an instructional video related to intuitive eating and were encouraged to meet virtually with their health coach. Participants provided self-report data on behavioral and psychological outcomes including intuitive eating, internalized weight stigma, eating disorder symptoms, and diet quality at baseline, post-intervention (3 months from baseline), and follow-up (6 months from baseline). Changes in behavioral and psychological outcomes from baseline to post-intervention and follow-up were examined using paired t-tests, with Cohen's d effect sizes reported. Generalized linear models were used to examine whether participant characteristics and program engagement were associated with program outcomes. RESULTS: Increases in intuitive eating and decreases in internalized weight stigma and eating disorder symptoms were seen from baseline to post-intervention (Cohen's d = 1.02, -0.47, and -0.63, respectively) and follow-up (Cohen's d = 0.86, -0.31, and -0.60). No changes in dietary quality were seen at post-intervention, but a significant reduction in intake of added sugars, fast food, and sugar sweetened beverages were observed at follow-up (Cohen's d = -0.35, -0.23, -0.25). CONCLUSIONS: This study provide preliminary support for the acceptability and potential impact of a weight-inclusive workplace wellness program that should be tested in a rigorous randomized trial.",

      "abstract": "Although intuitive eating (IE) has become an increasingly adopted intervention target, current conceptualisations of IE have yet to pivot away from (neuro)normative physiology and phenomenology. Autistic individuals commonly report disordered eating behaviours and/or poorer well-being but appear to benefit from adaptive interventions using an affirmative approach. This article uses autism as a case example to summarise challenges related to IE's prevailing conceptualisation, before proposing how future research and current practice can be extended to the autistic population. Scholars are encouraged to evaluate the full 10-principal IE framework while utilising a participatory-led approach. We argue that research using a mixed methods design is urgently needed to comprehensively explore the (re)conceptualisation of IE in autistic people. While IE shows promise for producing positive outcomes in the autistic population, we discuss the potential challenges for research and practice due to its current emphasis on accurate interoception, emotional awareness and processing, and executive functioning. This suggests the need for research and practice to integrate autistic needs and experiences into future developments with an affirmative approach. Public Significance: IE is an effective intervention for reducing disordered eating behaviours. Autistic individuals commonly present disordered eating behaviours and have unique nutritional needs which often require intervention. However, there is limited understanding of IE among the autistic population. Research-informed definitions involving autistic perspectives will support translating the IE framework to this underrepresented population.",

METHODS: The sample included participants (N = 1,383) from the population-based EAT 2010-2018 study who provided data in adolescence (14.4 ± 2.0 years) and emerging adulthood (22.0 ± 2.0 years) and had at least one caregiver complete surveys in adolescence. Generalized estimating equations evaluated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between restrictive feeding and PE in adolescence and IE in adolescence and emerging adulthood. Interactions with gender and parental concern over child weight in adolescence were explored. RESULTS: Restrictive feeding was cross-sectionally associated with lower IE in adolescence (b = -0.04), though evidence of moderation by parental weight concern indicated this association was only observed in the context of low parental weight concern. Greater PE was associated with lower adolescent IE among boys but higher IE among girls. Longitudinally, the association between PE in adolescence and IE in emerging adulthood differed by parental weight concern; greater PE predicted higher emerging adult IE at high parental weight concern, but lower IE at low parental weight concern. DISCUSSION: Controlling feeding practices in adolescence displayed differential associations with child IE in adolescence and emerging adulthood based on child gender and parental concern over child weight. Notably, PE was associated with greater IE among adolescent girls but lower IE among boys. Results suggest that parental feeding is a valuable intervention target.",

Based on the acceptance model of intuitive eating, ecological systems theory, family stress model, and transactional model of stress and coping, the present study aimed to explore the relationship between family cohesion and intuitive eating and its underlying mechanisms through a cross-sectional study design. A random sample of 702 college students from 29 provinces in China, aged from 18 to 26 years (54.56% male, M age = 21.12 years), voluntarily participated in the survey. Demographic variables, family cohesion, intuitive eating, perceived stress, and coping style were measured. The results indicated that family cohesion was significantly positively correlated with intuitive eating and the direct effect between them was significant. Meanwhile, there was a significant indirect effect of family cohesion on intuitive eating through perceived stress and positive coping styles. Moreover, perceived stress and positive coping styles, rather than negative coping styles, acted as serial mediators in the association between family cohesion and intuitive eating. The findings shed light on the prevention and intervention for disordered eating and obesity and provided a new theoretical perspective for the mental health education of college students. In addition, implications and directions for future research were also discussed.",

Stigma associated with type 2 diabetes, both in general and specific to weight, is damaging to self-care, which is crucial for the effective management of diabetes. Family relationships may buffer the negative impact of stress, especially among Black Americans who have historically relied on informal support networks. Our goal was to investigate how type 2 diabetes stigma (H1) and weight stigma (H2) were related to self-care and intuitive eating - a non-restrictive approach to nutrition; H3 predicted that family relationship satisfaction would moderate the relationships predicted in H1 and H2. Black Americans diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (N = 225) were recruited via Qualtrics panels to complete an online survey of self-report measures. We used multiple linear regression to test our hypotheses. Both chronic illness and weight stigma were related as predicted to one subscale of intuitive eating (eating for physical hunger). Our moderation analyses revealed that family relationship satisfaction was protective against the harms of stigma at moderate to high levels. Intuitive eating is a promising non-restrictive treatment option for type 2 diabetes.",

Several attempts were developed to teach IE principles including text-messaging interventions given that they are easy to implement and low cost. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a 5-week text message-based IE intervention on IE, while correcting for perceived stress (PS) and self-compassion (SC). DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Online, in Lebanon. PARTICIPANTS: Adults (n 195) were randomised into one of three groups: the active IE group receiving IE-related messages with a practice exercise, the passive IE group receiving only IE-related messages and the control group receiving general health-related tips. Ten messages were delivered over 5 weeks. Two follow-ups were made: directly post-intervention and 7 weeks later. Baseline data and follow-ups included demographics, nutrition-related variables and measures of IE, SC and PS. RESULTS: Results indicated improvements in IE scores in the two intervention groups (P = 0·05), with the passive IE group showing the most improvement. Also, a significant improvement in SC (Λ = 0·88, F (2, 63) = 4·40, P = 0·01) and reduction in PS (Λ = 0·86, F (2, 63) = 5·21, P = 0·008) were observed in the active IE group. CONCLUSION: Text-messaging interventions might be efficient in enhancing IE. Results shed light on the need for further large-scale interventions that use visual aids and provide practical guidance to teach IE, while further characterising the relation between IE, SC and stress.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Intuitive eating (IE) is an adaptive eating construct for which little research exists in eating disorder (ED) samples. IE is negatively correlated with disordered eating behaviors in healthy adolescents and adults, and similar associations have been found in adults with EDs. This study aims to examine IE in a treatment seeking sample of adolescents and their caregivers to understand the role of IE in weight gain during FBT. METHODS: Descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations were calculated in a sample of 47 pairs of adolescent patients and their caregivers who initiated outpatient FBT at a large academic medical center. Analyses examined associations between caregiver and adolescent IE on the Intuitive Eating Scale (IES), change in percent expected body weight (%EBW) by session 4 and end of treatment (EOT), clinical impairment, and ED pathology. RESULTS: Significant correlations were found between aspects of adolescent IE, ED symptoms, and clinical impairment. Caregiver IES scores (Reliance on Hunger and Satiety Cues, Body-Food Choice Congruence, IES Total) were negatively related to adolescent ED symptoms (EDE-Q Weight Concerns, EDE-Q Shape Concerns, EDE-Q Global) at baseline. Caregiver IE (Eating for Physical Rather than Emotional Reasons) was positively associated with adolescent weight gain at FBT session 4 and EOT, even when statistically adjusting for gender and initial level of care. CONCLUSION: Study results were consistent with past research indicating adolescent IE is negatively associated with ED behaviors, cognitions, and impairment. This study is the first to provide evidence that caregiver IE is positively associated with adolescent weight gain in FBT and is the first to provide evidence that caregiver IE is negatively related to adolescent ED symptoms. Future research should examine adolescent and caregiver IE throughout FBT to understand the role of IE in treatment response.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The loss of control over eating (LOCE) is frequently cited as a core process of eating disturbances. In contrast, mindful eating and intuitive eating have been identified as adaptive styles of eating and have been associated with positive psychological constructs. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate whether mindful or intuitive eating are potential protective factors for the loss of control over eating. METHODS: 1155 participants (64.2 % female) were recruited from a large university. Participants were administered select subscales of the Intuitive Eating Scale - 2nd edition (IES-2) and Mindful Eating Questionnaire (MEQ), and the brief Loss of Control over Eating Scale (LOCES-B). RESULTS: Controlling for BMI and age, intuitive and mindful eating were significantly associated with LOCE, F (8,966) = 114.78, p < .001, R2 = 0.49. Both IES-2 subscales were negatively associated with LOCE: 1) eating for physical rather than emotional reasons and 2) reliance on hunger and satiety cues, p < .001. One MEQ subscale was negatively associated with LOCE: disinhibition, p < .001. The MEQ subscales assessing awareness and external cues were not significantly associated with LOCE. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that while some forms of mindful eating and intuitive eating are potential protective factors, others may be less relevant to LOCE. These findings have implications for treatment, as they suggest intuitive eating may counteract the loss of control over eating. The findings also provide evidence for convergent validity of the LOCES by clarifying positive constructs that may protect against the development of this core eating pathology.",

      "abstract": "Though there is a robust literature base linking intuitive eating (IE) to better psychological health and reduced eating pathology, little is known about the psychometric properties of IES-2 measurement or how IE relates to eating psychopathology within eating disorder clinical samples. Importantly, some seemingly adaptive eating behaviors in non-clinical populations could conceivably result from disordered eating within clinical eating disorder populations (e.g., not eating when not hungry because of distorted hunger-fullness cues, furthering restriction). This study examined the factor structure, psychometric properties, and correlates of the Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2) in a transdiagnostic eating disorder sample (N = 224). Participants at an eating disorder specialty treatment center completed the IES-2 upon assessment, along with other symptomology measures. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed, finding a poor model fit in this transdiagnostic sample, CFI = 0.889, TLI = 0.869, RMSEA = 0.095, TLI = 0.869, and SRMR = 0.099. Through exploratory factor analysis, we identified a factor solution for the measure that can be used transdiagnostically in this population, with revised scoring and modifications. As expected, the IES-2 demonstrated construct validity, with higher IE being associated with lower eating pathology (r = -0.36, p < .01), lower clinical impairment (r = -0.26, p < .01), lower body image dissatisfaction (r = -0.39, p < .05), and lower depressive symptoms (r = -0.20, p < .01), supporting construct validity. As anticipated, IES-2 was not related to emotion regulation, supporting discriminant validity. This study suggests that the IES-2 does not perform as expected in a transdiagnostic clinical eating disorder population, and instead, a revised scored 21-item IES-2 is suggested, with interpretation of only the total score and two subscales.",

However, there is no evidence-based consensus on the impact of intuitive eating interventions on diet quality. This systematic review aimed to investigate intuitive eating interventions and their impact on diet quality. METHOD: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Cochrane databases were systematically searched to October 2021 for studies reporting interventions that encompassed the principles of intuitive eating and measured diet quality. Other health outcomes were used for secondary analysis. Findings were synthesized narratively. RESULTS: Seventeen papers reporting 14 intervention studies (n = 3,960) were included in the review. All studies found a positive or neutral effect on diet quality following an intuitive eating intervention. A favorable change in eating behavior following these interventions was also observed. DISCUSSION: Intuitive eating promotes an attunement to the body, which aids in improving diet quality because of increased awareness of physiological cues. The reduction of emotional and binge eating may also increase diet quality. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND PRACTICE: Findings from the current review suggest that intuitive eating interventions are most effective face-to-face, in a group setting, and sustained for at least 3 months.",

Training students in intuitive eating, an approach that promotes eating by internal cues, may be a way to ameliorate dietary restraint and low body appreciation, ultimately decreasing disordered eating. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a five-week intuitive eating intervention on dietary restraint, body appreciation, and intuitive eating in female-identifying undergraduates. A five-week intuitive eating intervention (NCT0394700) was facilitated by two Registered Dietitians. One treatment group (TG) (n = 7) and one waitlist control group (WLCG) (n = 7) participated in the trial. From baseline to post-intervention, there was a significant decrease in dietary restraint, t(12) = -2.88, p = 0.01, and a significant increase in intuitive eating, t(12) = 4.03, p = 0.002, in the TG compared to the WLCG. The intervention had replicable effects on all outcome variables. Measurements at the five-week follow-up suggested the impact was sustained. This study provides preliminary data suggesting an intuitive eating intervention may help improve disordered eating risk factors by decreasing dietary restraint and increasing intuitive eating in female-identifying undergraduates.",

However, possible predictors and outcomes of intuitive eating are poorly understood, as prospective study designs addressing this are missing. Since theoretical research indicates that positive body image might enhance - and be enhanced by - intuitive eating, the present study tested for possible reciprocal associations between three components of positive body image (body appreciation, functionality appreciation, and body image flexibility) and intuitive eating. Adult women (n = 3039) were invited to complete study measures at baseline (T1), four (T2), and eight month (T3) follow-up. Cross-lagged panel analyses were computed to test for possible reciprocal relationships between intuitive eating and positive body image components. Results showed that intuitive eating and both body appreciation and functionality appreciation were reciprocally related. Higher intuitive eating levels at T1 predicted greater increases in these two positive body image components at T2 (and vice versa). Similarly, higher intuitive eating levels at T2 predicted greater increases in these two positive body image components at T3 (and vice versa). Only unidirectional effects were observed between intuitive eating and body image flexibility: higher intuitive eating levels predicted greater increases in body image flexibility at the subsequent time-point. Findings suggest that intuitive eating and certain components of positive body image might serve to enhance each other over time. Intervention strategies designed to cultivate intuitive eating may also result in concomitant improvements in certain indices of positive body image.",

Few studies have examined intervention effects on body dissatisfaction and disordered eating in China, especially for interventions with positive psychological perspectives (e.g., intuitive eating). In this pilot study, 66 women participated in an eight-module intuitive eating intervention delivered online (n = 42; mean age, 30.74 years) and face-to-face (n = 24; mean age, 19.46 years) for 8 weeks. Measures of body image and eating behaviors were used to assess the intervention's feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy. Linear mixed models were used to analyze the data. The intervention had significant effects on both groups, promoting positive body image and intuitive eating and reducing negative body image and disordered eating behaviors. The effects of the online and face-to-face interventions did not differ significantly. Thus, whether delivered online or face-to-face, an intuitive eating intervention may effectively improve Chinese women's body image and eating behaviors.

The objective of this review was to aggregate and analyse the literature on IE interventions, thereby offering an early investigation of methodological approaches to intervention. This review was conducted in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA) guidelines. Searching was conducted in four electronic databases. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they delivered an IE intervention and used the Intuitive Eating Scale (IES). Nine studies were included in this review. Six were eligible for meta-analysis, though only outcomes on the IES were examined; all other measures were examined individually. All interventions led to improvements on measures of IE, with a large pooled effect size (1.50 [1.15, 1.85]) and positive changes on a variety of other outcomes relating to health. This pattern preliminarily suggests that IE interventions change psychological processes as intended and can be useful in promoting health behaviour. The present review offers a synthesis of existing approaches to IE interventions and an evaluation of which specific variants appear to be more effective. This paper provides a basis upon which future interventions can be developed to improve approaches to psychoeducation.Clinical ImplicationsInterventions contributed to improvements in measures of IE lasting up to 6 months.Interventions contributed to positive changes on outcomes such as quality of life, body image, and body appreciation.Self-management through IE-based interventions may be feasible and effective.",

Participants reported a decrease in fat bias for explicit/implicit wanting and explicit liking after 4 months and 1 year. For intuitive eating, the unconditional permission to eat decreased after 4 months, and the body-food choice congruence increased after 1 year. Changes in unconditional permission to eat and in body-food choice congruence were positively and negatively associated with both Δweight and with Δfat mass, respectively. Changes in explicit wanting for fat and taste bias were associated with Δweight. CONCLUSIONS: Food reward decreased after a moderate WL intervention. Participants successfully maintained their reduced weight, and most of the changes in eating behavior remained significant at the end of the follow-up period. Lifestyle interventions aiming at WL should also consider intuitive eating and food reward.",

DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a prospective noncontrolled clinical trial of a behavioral multisession group intervention for dietary management. Each group comprised five to eight participants in 14 weekly or biweekly sessions lasting about 90 minutes each. The IE principles were discussed during the meetings. The IE scale 2, translated and adapted to the study population, with a four-factor model was applied to assess IE attitudes. The 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire was applied to assess health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Of the 33 patients who began participation in the study, 23 patients (median [interquartile range]: age = 62.0 years [58.0-68.0]; 52.2% with diabetes; body mass index = 32.6 kg/m2 [30.2-39.3]; estimated glomerular filtration rate = 28.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 [22.0-31.0]) completed the intervention. Except for the IE subscale Body-Food Choice Congruence, the IE total score and all its subscales (Unconditional Permission to Eat, Eating for Physical Rather than Emotional Reasons, Reliance on Hunger and Satiety Cues, and Body-Food Choice Congruence) improved after the intervention. In a cross-sectional analysis, more intuitive eaters were older and had better scores for health-related quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The nutritional behavioral intervention embracing IE principles was effective to improve IE attitudes for this group of chronic kidney disease patients. These results are promising and may contribute to a paradigm change in the strategies to enhance motivation and adherence to dietary recommendations in this population.",

IE was also examined as a possible mediator in the relationship between body image-related fusion and ED symptoms. METHODS: This study includes cross-sectional analyses with data from 100 adult females and 75 adolescent females seeking residential treatment for an ED. Self-reported demographic information, ED symptoms, IE behaviors, and body image-related cognitive fusion were collected from participants within the first week of treatment following admission to the same residential ED treatment facility. RESULTS: ED symptom severity was significantly negatively associated with three of the four domains of IE; unconditional permission to eat, reliance on hunger and satiety cues, and body-food choice congruence. A significant mediational effect of IE on the relationship between body image-related fusion and ED symptoms through IE behaviors was observed (β = 11.3, SE = 0.003, p < 0.001). This effect was only observed for the unconditional permission to eat (β = 0.13, p = 0.003) and reliance on hunger and satiety cues (β = 0.10, p = 0.005) domains of IE when the domains were subsequently analyzed individually. CONCLUSION: Unconditional permission to eat and reliance on hunger and satiety cues appear to be particularly influential domains of IE in the relationship between body image-related fusion and ED symptom severity. It is possible that changes in these IE domains may be mechanisms through which body image-related fusion influences ED symptoms. Future longitudinal research is needed to better understand the relationship between body image-related cognitive fusion and IE and the potential for targeting these constructs specifically in the context of ED treatment.

However, little is known regarding how parental intuitive eating practices are related to characteristics of home food and meal environments. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between parental intuitive eating and the home food and meal environment. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of survey data collected online and by mail in 2015-2016 as part of the Project EAT cohort study. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Participants from 750 unique households (470 mothers, 280 fathers) were surveyed in young adulthood (Mean [M] age = 31.4 years, Standard Deviation [SD] = 1.5). Baseline enrollment of participants in the population-based Project EAT study was conducted in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, schools. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intuitive eating was assessed via self-report. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Modified Poisson regression models were conducted, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: Among mothers, higher intuitive eating scores were associated with greater likelihood of usually having fruits and vegetables in the home (prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.03) and with lower likelihood of usually having salty snacks and soda pop in the home (PR = 0.91). Higher intuitive eating scores were also associated with greater likelihood of usually serving fruits and vegetables at dinner among mothers (PR = 1.07). Among both mothers (PR = 1.08) and fathers (PR = 1.07), higher intuitive eating scores were associated with greater likelihood of usually having enough time and energy to prepare meals. CONCLUSIONS: Intuitive eating practices in parents are associated with specific home food environment characteristics. Extending the understanding of these relationships in longitudinal data has the potential to inform the directionality of influences and may help to identify targets for intervention.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2) has been shown to be a valid tool to assess the capability of eating in reaction to natural hunger/satiety cues. However, its factor structure seems to differ in function of cultural/socioeconomic backgrounds, and its psychometric properties among the adolescents with overweight/obesity (BMI-for-age percentile >85th) have not been examined yet. Thus, this study aims to 1) investigating the factorial structure/psychometric properties of IES-2 in adolescents with overweight/obesity; and 2) exploring the associations between impulsivity, quality of life disordered and intuitive eating. METHODS: A total of 202 Portuguese adolescents (124 girls; 78 boys; 12-19 years) under weight-loss treatment with a mean BMI z-score of 2.41 (SD = 0.75) participated in this study. The IES-2 factor structure was explored by confirmatory factor analysis and bifactor models. Test-retest reliability analyses were performed over 6 months (n = 41) and associations between the variables under study were explored. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analyses with posthoc modifications resulted in a bifactor model with acceptable fit supporting one general factor (intuitive eating) and three specific factors (IES-2 subscales). The \"Unconditional Permission to Eat\" subscale could not be replicated in this sample. Test-retest reliability analyses suggested good temporal stability. Intuitive eating scores were negatively associated with grazing eating behavior and impulsivity (negative urgency) and positively linked to quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: An adjusted version of IES-2 can be an appropriate measure for assessing intuitive eating levels in adolescents with overweight/obesity. Research on intuitive eating has the potential to enhance pediatric weight-loss interventions.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Internalized weight stigma (IWS) is common in the United States of America across body weight categories, and is implicated in the development of distress and unhealthy eating behaviors (e.g. overeating, disordered eating) that can foster poor cardiometabolic health. While emerging intervention research shows early promise in reducing IWS, long-term efficacy is unclear and novel strategies remain needed. This analysis examined whether participation in a mindful yoga intervention was associated with reduced IWS and increased intuitive eating, an adaptive eating behavior, and whether these changes correlated with each other or with changes in mindfulness and self-compassion. METHODS: Participants were stressed adults with low fruit and vegetable intake (N = 78, 64.1% White, M. Body Mass Index  25.59 ± 4.45) enrolled in a parent clinical trial of a 12-week mindful yoga intervention. Validated self-report measures of IWS, intuitive eating, mindfulness, and self-compassion were administered at pre-treatment, mid-treatment (8 weeks), post-treatment (12 weeks), and 4-month follow-up (24 weeks). RESULTS: Linear mixed modeling revealed significant improvements in IWS and intuitive eating across the four timepoints (p < .001). Reduced IWS correlated with increased intuitive eating pre- to post-treatment (p = .01). Improved self-compassion and mindfulness correlated with intuitive eating (both p = . 04), but not IWS (p = .74 and p = .56, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study offers preliminary support for the hypothesis that mindful yoga may promote intuitive eating and reduce IWS among stressed adults with poor diet, and suggests that changes in these factors may co-occur over time. Further investigation with controlled designs is necessary to better understand the temporality and causality of these relationships.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02098018."

Its use in clinical settings and in the community is rapidly growing in popularity. The Intuitive Eating Scale 2 (IES-2) is a widely used measure that indexes intuitive eating motivations and behaviour, however evidence of its validity in populations with clinical eating disorders remains scarce. The objective of the proposed study was thus to evaluate the factor structure of the IES-2 in a large sample of individuals seeking treatment for eating disorders in private practice. METHODS: Data collected from 569 women and men aged 12-68 years seeking treatment for an eating disorder in one of eight specialist private outpatient eating disorder clinics were examined using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Relationships between IES-2 scores and measures of psychopathology were also examined. RESULTS: Results were relatively consistent with the purported four-factor structure of the IES-2. The measure displayed strong construct validity and good internal consistency. Scores on the IES-2 were inversely associated with scores of depression, anxiety, and disordered eating, providing evidence for divergent validity of the measure. Clinical norms are provided for anorexia nervosa (AN) spectrum disorders and bulimia nervosa (BN) spectrum disorders, as well as for the clinical sample as a whole. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that the IES-2 may be an appropriate measure for evaluating behaviours relating to IE in community outpatient eating disorder settings, and provide further evidence for the association between IE and positive health outcomes.

Knowledge of robust protective factors is lacking, which might account for the limited effectiveness of existing prevention programs. As positive body image, intuitive eating, and self-compassion show protective potential, the present study tested whether these factors protect against the onset of a range of different eating disorder symptoms. METHOD: Data were analyzed from 1,270 women who completed study measures at baseline and 8 months. Logistic regressions tested whether, among initially asymptomatic women, baseline and changes in positive body image components (body appreciation, body image flexibility, and functionality appreciation), intuitive eating, and self-compassion predicted the continued absence versus onset of seven core eating disorder symptoms at follow-up. RESULTS: Each of the five factors at baseline was associated with a lower odds of symptom onset for each outcome in univariate analyses. Baseline body appreciation and intuitive eating scores remained consistent, unique predictors of a lower odds of experiencing symptom onset in multivariate models. Greater increases in intuitive eating and body appreciation over time were the two factors consistently associated with a lower odds of symptom onset across several outcomes. DISCUSSION: This study provides strong evidence for the protective influence of positive body image components, intuitive eating, and self-compassion against several eating disorder symptoms. Building these factors within established prevention programs may, in the longer term, help reduce the incidence of eating disorder syndromes and symptoms.",

METHODS: Participants were randomized to a four-session DB intervention (n = 38) or assessment-only control (AOC) (n = 36), and completed validated measures assessing intuitive eating, body appreciation, self-esteem, body-ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction, negative affect, and disordered eating pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at 4- and 24-week follow-ups. RESULTS: The DB condition demonstrated significantly greater increases in intuitive eating, body appreciation and self-esteem scores compared to AOC from pre-intervention to post-intervention (between-condition Cohen's d = 0.73-0.98), 4-week (between-condition Cohen's d = 1.25-1.87) and 24-week follow-up (between-condition Cohen's d = 0.82-1.38). Also, the DB condition showed significantly greater decreases in body-ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction and disordered eating scores from pre-intervention to post-intervention (between-condition Cohen's d = 0.76-1.04), 4-week (between-condition Cohen's d = 1.27-1.71) and 24-week follow-up (between-condition Cohen's d = 1.04-1.19). Regarding negative affect, DB condition showed significantly greater reduction only at 24-week follow-up (between-condition Cohen's d = 0.60).

Thus, novel and accessible approaches are warranted. However, few behavioral health interventions progress beyond initial implementation, underscoring the importance of feasibility and acceptability data to guide intervention development and refinement. Stakeholder perspectives can enrich these data, as they can highlight potential mechanisms to investigate in larger randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). The current study examined participant and leader feedback from an 8-week pilot intuitive eating (IE) intervention for college women with disordered eating delivered through group and guided self-help (GSH) modalities. Participants (N = 71) and leaders (N = 8) completed anonymous weekly surveys and exit questionnaires. Overall, the intervention was acceptable and feasible for both participants and leaders. Unique benefits of each modality, such as validation and support in group, and individualization and convenience in GSH, contributed to participant satisfaction and efficacy. Moreover, potential mechanisms of intervention effects, such as interoceptive awareness and self-compassion, were cited in both conditions, and should be explored in a future, fully-powered RCT. Areas for potential refinement include extending the intervention, assessing a hybrid treatment, online delivery, and careful design of a control condition to isolate the intervention's mechanisms of change.",

The model postulates that a grateful attitude is associated with body appreciation and intuitive eating via reduced contingent self-worth and social comparison. The current study aims to examine the applicability of the model to Japanese women. A sample of 648 Japanese women (age range = 15-69, M = 42.1, SD = 15.7) completed online measures of gratitude, contingent self-worth, social comparison, body appreciation, and intuitive eating. In general, all paths in the original model were replicated in the current model. However, two new paths were added to achieve good fit, including a path from basing one's self-worth on others' approval to body appreciation and another path from gratitude directly to intuitive eating. These differential pathways are discussed in the context of Japanese culture that emphasizes appreciation towards foods and self-definition based on social approval. In addition, implications for intervention are described.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stimuli that promote eating in the absence of the physiological need for food are pervasive and can facilitate excessive energy intake. The practices of mindful eating (ME) and intuitive eating (IE) have been developed to minimize external drivers of energy intake by helping individuals emphasize the sensory properties of foods and internal indicators of hunger and fullness. OBJECTIVE: To enhance understanding about the effect of ME and IE interventions on dietary intake, this systematic review included randomized trials of ME and IE interventions that examined dietary intake, defined as energy intake or diet quality, in adults of varying weight status without a diagnosis of an eating disorder. METHODS: The selection of literature followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses systematic review process, in which PubMed, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and PsycINFO databases were searched for studies published between January 1980 and November 2019. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: randomized trial design in which 1 arm was an intervention with an ME or IE component and there was at least 1 control or active comparison arm; enrolled participants were of a healthy weight or with overweight or obesity and reported not having an eating disorder (ie, anorexia, bulimia nervosa, or binge eating disorder) or other health conditions in which dietary restrictions were applied; were at least 18 years of age; and outcomes of energy intake or diet quality were reported at baseline and post intervention. The modified Downs and Black checklist was used to assess risk of bias for each study that met inclusion criteria. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies, including 8 investigating ME interventions and 5 investigating IE interventions, represented in 14 articles, were included in the review. Seven of the 9 articles reporting on energy intake did not find significant group differences. Eight of the 12 articles reporting on diet quality did not find significant group differences. The mean bias assessment score was 13.6 out of 28, indicating poor quality. CONCLUSIONS: Little evidence suggests that ME and IE interventions influence energy intake or diet quality. To draw strong conclusions about the effect of ME and IE on dietary intake, future research using study designs of high rigor are needed.",

This adaptive eating style has been linked to a number of positive physical and psychological outcomes. Interestingly, women tend to report lower levels of intuitive eating compared to men. It has been hypothesized that sociocultural pressures or dieting could be contributing factors to this sex discrepancy. The current study aimed to explore whether sex moderates the relationship between either dietary restraint and intuitive eating, or between emotional eating and intuitive eating. Assessments were administered to a sample of college males and females (N = 478) as part of a larger study of eating behaviors. Moderation analyses indicated that higher dietary restraint was more strongly associated with lower levels of intuitive eating in women than in men. Emotional eating also had a stronger negative association with intuitive eating in women compared to men. Additionally, relationships between dietary restraint/emotional eating and a component of intuitive eating, \"eating for physical rather than emotional reasons\", was stronger for women compared to men. These findings suggest that dietary restraint and emotional eating may serve as barriers in the implementation of an intuitive eating style, especially for women. Prevention and intervention efforts should target those high in dietary restraint and emotional eating.",

Campuses lack resources to meet this need, thus accessible and affordable treatment options are important. Intuitive eating (IE) is gaining mainstream interest, but intervention research is scarce, with no known clinical trials in college women. This uncontrolled pilot trial examined the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an eight-week IE intervention delivered through two potentially accessible and affordable modalities: group and guided self-help (GSH). METHOD: Racially and ethnically diverse college women (N = 71; <50% White) were recruited from a large public Mid-Atlantic university and randomized to group (n = 40) or GSH (n = 31). Assessments occurred at 0 (pre-test), 8 (post-test), and 16 weeks (follow-up). Group participants attended eight weekly 1.5-hour sessions. GSH participants engaged in self-study and had eight weekly 20-minute phone calls. RESULTS: Both conditions demonstrated feasibility, with superior retention and attendance in GSH. Over 90% of those attending at least one session in either condition were retained through follow-up. Both conditions were highly acceptable, and produced medium to large reductions in DEBs, body dissatisfaction, and weight-bias internalization, and improvements in body appreciation, IE, and satisfaction with life from pre- to post-test, which were maintained at follow-up. DISCUSSION: Results of this pilot are encouraging and support the development of a larger randomized controlled trial. Avenues for refinement include strategies to improve feasibility of the group condition, and conducting longer-term follow-up to examine maintenance of effects and the intervention's eating disorder prevention potential.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To examine longitudinal associations of intuitive eating (IE), defined as eating according to internal hunger and satiety cues, with psychological health outcomes and disordered eating behaviors. METHODS: Data from a diverse sample of 1491 participants (54.1% female, 19.7% non-Hispanic white) followed from adolescence (baseline; Mage = 14.5 years) into young adulthood (follow-up; Mage = 22.2 years) came from the population-based EAT 2010-2018 (Eating and Activity over Time) study. Logistic regression models predicting psychological health outcomes and disordered eating behaviors at follow-up simultaneously included baseline IE and change in IE from baseline to follow-up as predictors, adjusting for demographic covariates, body mass index, and outcome at baseline. RESULTS: Greater baseline IE and increases in IE from baseline to follow-up were both associated with lower odds of high depressive symptoms, low self-esteem, high body dissatisfaction, unhealthy weight control behaviors (e.g., fasting, skipping meals), extreme weight control behaviors (e.g., taking diet pills, vomiting), and binge eating at 8-year follow-up. Particularly strong protective associations were observed for binge eating, such that a one-point higher IE score at baseline was associated with 74% lower odds of binge eating at follow-up, and a one-point higher increase in IE score from baseline to follow-up was associated with 71% lower odds of binge eating at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that IE longitudinally predicts better psychological and behavioral health across a range of outcomes and suggest that IE may be a valuable intervention target for improving psychological health and reducing disordered eating behaviors, particularly binge eating.

Participants included 94 female university students (mean age = 20.6 years; mean BMI = 23.8 kg/m2), randomly assigned either to the non-dieting intervention condition or a brochure control condition. The intervention consisted of two 90-120 min interactive group sessions designed to engender the rejection of dieting, increase body acceptance, and develop healthy eating skills. Assessment measures were collected at baseline, post-treatment, and one-month follow-up. The group sessions produced significant improvements in the intervention group compared to the control group on measures of dieting intention, intuitive eating, body image dissatisfaction, eating concerns, and anti-fat attitudes. These effects were sustained at one-month follow-up. There were also overall improvements over time in dietary intake and mental health-related quality of life across conditions. This study extends the research on non-dieting approaches by using a brief, dissonance-based structure and by applying the intervention to a young adult sample that included participants of normal weight. The findings here indicate that a non-dieting approach is acceptable and feasible, and can result in improvements in eating and weight-related behaviors, in young adult women.",

Studies have shown that online prevention programs can lower these risk factors. The aim of this feasibility pilot study was to estimate effects of a 12-week online health promotion and eating disorder prevention program in a sample of women with overweight or obesity, but without binge eating. METHODS: The program was evaluated in an uncontrolled pre-post-follow-upstudy over 12 months. Outcome measures were eating disorder related cognitions and attitudes. Participants were recruited via flyers, online posts, press releases, and mailings through cooperating health insurances. RESULTS: 371 women who completed the screening met the inclusion criteria. 323 women took part in the baseline assessment and were granted access to the intervention. 50 women completed all sessions. An intention-to-treat analysis showed significant and long-term reductions in weight and shape concerns, restrictive eating and increases in life satisfaction and self-esteem (d = 0.31-0.86), and a short-term increase in fruit and vegetable consumption (d = 0.70). CONCLUSION: everyBody fit seems a feasible program for improving body image and reducing disordered eating in overweight and obese women, with medium to large effects on various outcomes. The efficacy of the intervention needs to be established in a randomized controlled trial.",

Thirty-seven inpatients with AN and 39 normal-weight controls completed a heartbeat perception task and the Intuitive Eating Scale-2. Patients with AN reported lower intuitive eating than controls, whereas interoceptive sensitivity did not differ between groups. Higher interoceptive sensitivity was related to higher intuitive eating across both groups. In patients with AN, both higher interoceptive sensitivity and intuitive eating correlated with the number of days in the hospital and with higher body mass index (BMI), when controlling for BMI at admission.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effectiveness of the revised My Body Knows When (MBKW) program to promote intuitive eating behaviors within a sample of a military population through an online or in-person delivery mode. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-six overweight or obese adults (70% female); military service members (20%), retirees (38%) and family (42%) participated in the 10-week MBKW program at two military installations from 2012 to 2014. Body Mass Index, Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2; 23-item) and Motivation for Eating scale (MFES; 43-item) were collected at baseline and 10-weeks. Data were stratified by sex. Descriptive data were reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD), frequency, or percentage. A paired t-test was conducted with data at baseline and 10 weeks (α = 0.05, 80% power). RESULTS: Participants were predominantly female (70%); mean age of 51 ± 13 years; and BMI of 34.1 ± 5.5 kg/m2. There were no demographic, MFES, or IES-2 baseline differences between groups (in-person vs. online) or location. All subjects were collapsed into one group for a pre-post MBKW implementation assessment due to small sample size despite the original intent to stratify by online and in-person grouping. At 10 weeks, the remaining 26 participants exhibited a significant improvement (mean ± SD) in BMI (-0.4 ± 0.6 kg/m2; p = 0.012), environmental/social eating score (2.7 ± 0.4 points [pts]; -0.5 pt change; p < 0.001), emotional eating score (2.2 ± 0.5 pts; -0.6 pt change; p = 0.001), unconditional permission to eat score (3.4 ± 0.4 pts; +0.3 pt change; p = 0.017), eating for physical rather than emotional eating score (3.7 ± 0.8 pts; +1.0 pt change; p < 0.001), and reliance on hunger and satiety cues score (3.6 ± 0.5 pts; +0.8 pt change; p = 0.001). High attrition rates at the 10-week follow-up assessment precluded accurate assessment of long-term intervention effects. CONCLUSIONS: The MBKW program was associated with improved intuitive eating behaviors and with less external eating influence on behavior; however, a larger sample is required to assess the effectiveness of MBKW delivery mode. Modest weight loss was attained but testing the efficacy of the MBKW program in a large diverse sample with alternate scenarios may be worthwhile (e.g., primary prevention against weight gain, or during weight maintenance to prevent weight regain).",

      "abstract": "This article describes a study protocol, which aims to explore and describe the feasibility of a mobile-phone application for initiating intuitive eating and intuitive exercising in patients who are following an ambulatory treatment for obesity. Intuitive eating refers to one's ability to make food choices based on one's awareness of his/her body's response. Intuitive exercising encourages people in finding enjoyable ways of being physically active. These two components will be trained using an implementation intention procedure, that is, behavioral plans that aim at creating a strong link between a specified situation and a response. We aim to recruit up to 80 overweight and obese patients over a period of 2 years. The smartphone application will be assessed on the basis of (i) data obtained through a 4-week use period, (ii) self-report measures taken before and after the use of the mobile application, and (iii) feedbacks from participants after the use of the mobile application. This pilot study will allow us to better understand the applicability of the use of mobile application within ambulatory treatment settings, and to adapt the design of the app necessary for building cross-sectional studies investigating its efficacy."

In this structured literature review, a summary of the current evidence is presented, together with details of interventions undertaken and the tools to measure outcomes. It is broad in scope given the emerging evidence base in this area. The review yielded sixty-eight publications: twenty-three interventions in obese/overweight populations; twenty-nine interventions in normal-weight populations; sixteen observational studies, three of which were carried out in overweight/obese populations. Mindfulness-based approaches appear most effective in addressing binge eating, emotional eating and eating in response to external cues. There is a lack of compelling evidence for the effectiveness of mindfulness and mindful eating in weight management. Mindfulness-based approaches may prevent weight gain. Reduced food intake was seen in some of the studies in overweight and obese populations, but this was less apparent in the studies in normal-weight populations. The evidence base for intuitive eating is limited to date and further research is needed to examine its potential in altering eating behaviours. Mindfulness appears to work by an increased awareness of internal, rather than external, cues to eat. Mindfulness and mindful eating have the potential to address problematic eating behaviours and the challenges many face with controlling their food intake. Encouraging a mindful eating approach would seem to be a positive message to be included in general weight management advice to the public.",

The focus of the present study was on exploring mechanisms of change in intuitive eating and weight in acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) interventions. Mediation provides important information regarding the treatment processes and theoretical models related to specific treatment approaches. The study investigates whether psychological flexibility, mindfulness skills and sense of coherence mediated the interventions' effect on intuitive eating and weight. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a randomized control trial. Mediation analysis compared two ACT interventions - face-to-face (in a group) and mobile (individually) - with a control group using a latent difference score model. Settings Data were collected in three Finnish towns. SUBJECTS: The participants were overweight or obese (n 219), reporting symptoms of perceived stress. RESULTS: The effect of the interventions on participants' (i) BMI, (ii) intuitive eating and its subscales, (iii) eating for physical rather than emotional reasons and (iv) reliance on internal hunger and satiety cues was mediated by changes in weight-related psychological flexibility in both ACT groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ACT interventions aiming for lifestyle changes mediate the intervention effects through the enhanced ability to continue with valued activities even when confronted with negative emotions and thoughts related to weight.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Middle-aged women are at risk of weight gain and associated comorbidities. Deliberate restriction of food intake (dieting) produces short-term weight loss but is largely unsuccessful for long-term weight management. Two promising approaches for the prevention of weight gain are intuitive eating (ie, eating in accordance with hunger and satiety signals) and the development of greater psychological flexibility (ie, the aim of acceptance and commitment therapy [ACT]). OBJECTIVES: This pilot study investigated the usage, acceptability, and feasibility of \"Mind, Body, Food,\" a Web-based weight gain prevention intervention prototype that teaches intuitive eating and psychological flexibility skills. METHODS: Participants were 40 overweight women (mean age 44.8 [standard deviation, SD, 3.06] years, mean body mass index [BMI] 32.9 [SD 6.01] kg/m2, mean Intuitive Eating Scale [IES-1] total score 53.4 [SD 7.46], classified as below average) who were recruited from the general population in Dunedin, New Zealand. Module completion and study site metrics were assessed using Google Analytics. Use of an online self-monitoring tool was determined by entries saved to a secure online database. Intervention acceptability was assessed postintervention. BMI, intuitive eating, binge eating, psychological flexibility, and general mental and physical health were assessed pre- and postintervention and 3-months postintervention. RESULTS: Of the 40 women enrolled in the study, 12 (30%) completed all 12 modules (median 7.5 [interquartile range, IQR, 2-12] modules) and 4 (10%) used the self-monitoring tool for all 14 weeks of the intervention period (median 3 [IQR 1-9] weeks). Among 26 women who completed postintervention assessments, most women rated \"Mind, Body, Food\" as useful (20/26, 77%), easy to use (17/25, 68%) and liked the intervention (22/25, 88%). From pre- to postintervention, there were statistically significant within-group increases in intuitive eating (IES-2 total score P<.001; all IES-2 subscale scores: P ≤.01), psychological flexibility (P=.01), and general mental health (P<.001) as well as significant decreases in binge eating (P=.01). At the 3-month follow-up, IES-2 improvements were maintained, and there were further improvements in binge eating (P<.001) and general mental health (P=.03), and a marginal yet nonsignificant tendency for further improvement in psychological flexibility (P=.06). There were no significant within-group changes in BMI from pre- to postintervention and postintervention to 3-month follow-up (P=.46 and P=.93, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The \"Mind, Body, Food\" prototype Web-based intervention is appealing to middle-aged women and may be a useful tool to help women learn intuitive eating and ACT skills, reduce binge eating, and maintain weight over 3 months. Further work to improve the user experience and engagement is required before testing the online intervention in a randomized controlled trial."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Health at Every Size® (HAES®) interventions focus on healthy lifestyle by promoting behavioral changes related to diet and physical activity while emphasizing self-acceptance and well-being through an empowerment and intuitive approach. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a HAES® program on intuitive eating and diet quality in women. METHODS: The HAES® intervention, offered by professionals from Health and Social Services Centers in Quebec (Canada), was composed of thirteen 3-h weekly meetings and a 6-h intensive day. For this study, 216 women (1.9% normal-weight, 21.1% overweight, 77.0% obese) who took part to the HAES program were compared to 110 women (3.9% normal-weight, 23.3% overweight, 72.8% obese) from a control group (waiting list). Intuitive eating was assessed using the Intuitive Eating Scale and diet quality was evaluated through the calculation of the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) from a validated web-based self-administrated food frequency questionnaire. Measurements were performed at baseline, post-intervention, and at one-year follow-up. RESULTS: Women who participated in the HAES® program significantly increased their intuitive eating score compared to women in the control group at post-intervention and at follow-up (group by time interaction, p = 0.0002). A significant improvement in diet quality was also observed in the HAES® group in comparison with the control group at post-intervention (group by time interaction, p = 0.0139). The intuitive eating score and the HEI score were positively associated in the HAES® group at post-intervention (r = 0.20, p = 0.0237) and one-year follow-up (r = 0.22, p = 0.0359), but no such associations were noted in the control group (post-intervention, r = 0.04, p = 0.70; one-year follow-up, r = -0.15, p = 0.30). CONCLUSIONS: The HAES® program seems effective in improving intuitive eating and also favours improvements in diet quality. However, the association between intuitive eating and diet quality remains unclear, being positive and significant only after the HAES® intervention.",

A sample of college first years completed baseline measurements during an intuitive eating intervention to test the association between intuitive eating and body image discrepancy (BID). BID represents whether a respondent believes her current body is larger or smaller than ideal. Greater BID was negatively associated with intuitive eating (p ≤ .05); participants who believed that their current bodies were larger than ideal were less likely to attend to hunger and satiety cues than participants who expressed little or no BID.

METHODS: A total of 11,774 men and 40,389 women aged ≥18 years participating in the NutriNet-Santé cohort were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Self-reported weight and height were collected as well as IE levels using the validated French version of the Intuitive Eating Scale-2. The association between IE and weight status was assessed using multinomial logistic regression models. RESULTS: A higher IE score was strongly associated with lower odds of overweight or obesity in both men and women. The strongest associations were observed in women for both overweight [quartile 4 vs. 1 of IE: odds ratio, 95% confidence interval: (0.19, 0.17-0.20)] and obesity (0.09, 0.08-0.10). Associations in men were as follows: for overweight (0.43, 0.38-0.48) and obesity (0.14, 0.11-0.18). CONCLUSIONS: IE is inversely associated with overweight and obesity which supports its importance. Although no causality can be inferred from the reported associations, these data suggest that IE might be relevant for obesity prevention and treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While there have been considerable advances in the medical management of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), for many, glycaemic control remains substandard. Nutrition and eating behaviour are important additional factors to consider with regards to T1DM management and outcomes. Intuitive eating is one such factor, and has not previously been investigated in T1DM. With this in mind, we undertook a study examining the relationship between intuitive eating and glycaemic control in adolescents with T1DM. METHODS: A case-control study of adolescents with established T1DM, and age/sex matched controls was conducted. Demographic information, the Intuitive Eating Scale (IES), and HbA1c were collected. Statistical analysis was undertaken to explore associations between the IES and HbA1c as a marker of glycaemic control. RESULTS: Data on 38 adolescents with T1DM, and 39 age/sex matched controls were obtained. Those with T1DM had significantly lower (by 0.5 SD) IES scores compared to controls (p = 0.009). Higher values of both total IES and the Eating for physical rather than emotional reasons subscale were associated with lower HbA1c: HbA1c 22% lower/whole unit increase in total IES mean score, HbA1c 11% lower/whole unit increase in Eating for physical rather than emotional reasons mean score, p = 0.017 and p = 0.009 respectively. CONCLUSION: In adolescents with T1DM, there appears to be a strong association between intuitive eating, in particular the effect of emotion on eating, and glycaemic control. In addition, those with T1DM have lower scores for their intuitive eating behaviour compared to controls. Emotional eating could be a future target for screening and potentially intervening in those with T1DM, as part of a wider treatment package to improve glycaemic control. Continuing efforts are needed to fully understand the important dynamics of diabetes, adolescence, diet, emotion, and how these factors affect long term outcomes in those with T1DM.",

The participants were overweight or obese persons (N = 306) reporting symptoms of perceived stress and enrolled in a psychological lifestyle intervention study. Participants completed self-report measures of psychological flexibility; mindfulness including the subscales observe, describe, act with awareness, non-react, and non-judgment; and intuitive eating including the subscales unconditional permission to eat, eating for physical reasons, and reliance on hunger/satiety cues. Psychological flexibility and mindfulness were positively associated with intuitive eating factors. The results suggest that mindfulness and psychological flexibility are related constructs that not only account for some of the same variance in intuitive eating, but they also account for significant unique variances in intuitive eating. The present results indicate that non-judgment can explain the relationship between general psychological flexibility and unconditional permission to eat as well as eating for physical reasons. However, mindfulness skills-acting with awareness, observing, and non-reacting-explained reliance on hunger/satiety cues independently from general psychological flexibility. These findings suggest that mindfulness and psychological flexibility are interrelated but not redundant constructs and that both may be important for understanding regulation processes underlying eating behavior.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In an effort to treat obesity, health care professionals pursue, by means of dieting and exercise interventions, weight loss as a primary goal of treatment. Although in few cases these interventions induce shortterm moderate weight loss, in the long-term, the efficacy of these treatments is at least questionable. Weight-loss interventions based on restrictive diets may be associated to adverse health and well-being. In this regard, some researchers have considered shifting the focus of obesity treatment into a health-centered paradigm. Among the models derived from this new paradigm, Health at Every Size (HAES) is one of the most referenced. HAES has enhanced intuitive eating as a core component of the paradigm, which refers to the reliance on biological mechanisms to regulate food intake (i.e., internal hunger and satiety cues). Recently, intuitive eating has been winning recognition since it have been associated with numerous indices of physical and psychological well-being, and noteworthy, it have not been related to any adverse effects. OBJECTIVE: The present paper reviews the concept of intuitive eating, as well as the existing evidence that upholds this emerging approach. Also, it discusses the implication of shifting the focus of dietetic interventions into a health-centered paradigm. DESIGN: Narrative Review. CONCLUSIONS: Although it is certain there is a need to extend current research on health-centered interventions, this approach may be a more promising and realistic alternative to address overweight and obesity than the conventional weight-loss treatments.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To examine the efficacy of a novel intervention for problematic eating behaviors and body dissatisfaction. DESIGN: Participants enrolled in the intervention or waitlist comparison group were assessed at pre and post 10 weeks. SETTING: Midwestern university. SUBJECTS: One hundred twenty-four female employees or partners/spouses. INTERVENTION: Eat for Life is a 10-week group intervention integrating mindfulness and intuitive eating skills. MEASURES: Self-report questionnaires included the Intuitive Eating Scale, Body Appreciation Scale, Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, Questionnaire for Eating Disorder Diagnoses, and an author-constructed supplemental and demographic questionnaire. ANALYSIS: Analyses of covariance and ordinal regression measured group differences. Structural equation modeling examined mediation effects. Results . Significant differences between groups were observed for body appreciation (F1,121 = 40.17, p = .000, partial eta squared = .25), intuitive eating (F1,121 = 67.44, p = .000, partial eta squared = .36), and mindfulness (F1,121 = 30.50, p = .000, partial eta squared = .20), with mean scores significantly higher in the intervention group than waitlist comparison group after 10 weeks. The intervention group was 3.65 times more likely to be asymptomatic for disordered eating than the comparison group. Mindfulness served as a partial mediator. CONCLUSION: The study provides support for an intervention combining intuitive eating and mindfulness for treatment of problematic eating behaviors and body dissatisfaction, with limitations including self-selection and lack of active control group.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Examine a model that encourages health at every size as opposed to weight loss. The health at every size concept supports homeostatic regulation and eating intuitively (ie, in response to internal cues of hunger, satiety, and appetite). DESIGN: Six-month, randomized clinical trial; 2-year follow-up. SUBJECTS: White, obese, female chronic dieters, aged 30 to 45 years (N=78). SETTING: Free-living, general community. INTERVENTIONS: Six months of weekly group intervention (health at every size program or diet program), followed by 6 months of monthly aftercare group support. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anthropometry (weight, body mass index), metabolic fitness (blood pressure, blood lipids), energy expenditure, eating behavior (restraint, eating disorder pathology), and psychology (self-esteem, depression, body image). Attrition, attendance, and participant evaluations of treatment helpfulness were also monitored. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED: Analysis of variance. RESULTS: Cognitive restraint decreased in the health at every size group and increased in the diet group, indicating that both groups implemented their programs. Attrition (6 months) was high in the diet group (41%), compared with 8% in the health at every size group. Fifty percent of both groups returned for 2-year evaluation. Health at every size group members maintained weight, improved in all outcome variables, and sustained improvements. Diet group participants lost weight and showed initial improvement in many variables at 1 year; weight was regained and little improvement was sustained. CONCLUSIONS: The health at every size approach enabled participants to maintain long-term behavior change; the diet approach did not. Encouraging size acceptance, reduction in dieting behavior, and heightened awareness and response to body signals resulted in improved health risk indicators for obese women.",
