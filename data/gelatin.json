      "abstract": "The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in regenerative medicine has gained considerable attention in recent years with the development of clinically relevant MSCs from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and embryonic stem cells. Through sequential presentations of appropriate growth factors (GFs), iPSCs can be differentiated into mesodermal cells and then into MSCs. Furthermore, the formation of 3-dimensional cell spheroids, known as embryoid bodies, can be used to mimic in vivo conditions. However, the compact nature of embryoid bodies restricts the efficient and uniform delivery of GFs, leading to the formation of necrotic zones and hindered differentiation. To address this, we developed 2 types of gelatin microparticles (GelMPs) with distinct degradation rates for sequential delivery of GFs to enhance differentiation while preventing necrotic zones. In 2-dimensional culture, bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) were identified as key proteins inducing iPSC differentiation into mesodermal cells and MSCs. The sequential presentation of these GFs was optimized for a 3-dimensional culture system by engineering fast-degrading GelMPs conjugated with BMP4 and slow-degrading GelMPs conjugated with FGF2. Our approach facilitated efficient iPSC differentiation into induced mesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs), as demonstrated by enhanced expression of mesodermal markers during the early stages of differentiation and MSC-specific markers at later stages. The resulting iMSCs exhibited characteristic surface markers (e.g., CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD44) and trilineage differentiation capability and were genetically stable. Compared to adult-derived MSCs, iMSCs showed superior proliferative capacity and reduced senescence, making them advantageous for cell therapy and regenerative medicine. This innovative approach of generating iMSCs has vast potential for therapeutic applications."

      "abstract": "Repair and regeneration of oral and maxillofacial tissue defects remain significant challenges, mainly due to the limitations of existing treatment approaches. Conventional methods such as transplantation, tissue scaffolds, growth factors, and stem cell therapies often face obstacles, including donor shortages, insufficient vascularization, and safety concerns. There is an urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies to effectively promote vascular regeneration while minimizing complications. Black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) and hydrogels present significant advantages and broad application potential as tissue regeneration carriers due to their biocompatibility, degradability, and controlled drug release properties. By combining various characterization techniques and detection methods, we conducted a thorough analysis of BPNSs and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) scaffolds loaded with BPNSs (BP-GelMA). The results indicate that this study successfully prepared BPNSs with uniform size, good dispersion, and intact structure. Moreover, the BP-GelMA composite demonstrated excellent swelling behavior and structural stability while effectively enabling the controlled release of BPNSs. This study investigated the angiogenic effects of BP-GelMA at concentrations of 0, 12.5, and 25.0 μg/mL. In vitro experiments showed that BP-GelMA significantly enhanced endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation. In vivo results demonstrated that 12.5 μg/mL and 25.0 μg/mL BP-GelMA did not induce significant developmental toxicity in zebrafish and effectively promoted neovascularization. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that BP-GelMA activates angiogenesis-related biological processes. Mechanistic studies identified PEAK1 as a central regulator, driving vascular formation through activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. These findings highlight the potential of BP-GelMA as a therapeutic strategy for promoting angiogenesis and underscore the importance of optimizing BP-GelMA concentrations to achieve maximum therapeutic efficacy and safety in clinical applications."

      "abstract": "Synchrotron microbeam radiotherapy (MRT) is an innovative cancer treatment that uses micron-sized of ultra-high dose rate spatially fractionated X-rays to effectively control cancer growth while reducing the damage to surrounding healthy tissue. However, the current pre-clinical experiments are commonly limited with the use of conventional two-dimensional cell cultures which cannot accurately model in vivo tissue environment. This study aims to propose a three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel protocol and to characterize 3D bioprinted glioma relative to cell monolayer and spheroid models for experimental MRT using 9L rat gliosarcoma and U87 human glioma. Synchrotron broad-beam (SBB) and MRT beams were delivered to all cell models using 5, 10, and 20 Gy. 3D bioprinting enables the creation of 3D cell models that mimic in vivo conditions using bioinks, biomaterials, and cells. Synchrotron dosimetry, Monte Carlo simulation, in vitro cell viability, and fluorescence microscopy were performed to understand the relationship of the radiation dosimetry with the radiobiological response of different cancer models. Encapsulated gliomas were placed inside 3D printed human and rat phantoms to mimic scattering conditions. Results showed that MRT kills more gliomas relative to SBB for all cell models. The 3D bioprinted culture detected the spatial clustering of dead cells due to MRT high peak doses as seen in fluorescence imaging. The result of this study progresses MRT research by integrating 3D bioprinting techniques in radiobiological experiments. The study's bioprinting protocol and results will help in reducing the use of animal experiments and possibly in clinical translation of MRT.",

The technique involves the separation of proteins through electrophoresis in a substrate copolymerized sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under a nonreducing condition, and the enzymes are renatured to detect the gelatinase activity. The MMPs are a group of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that degrade the components of the extracellular matrix, including the basement membrane. MMPs are linked to a variety of physiological and pathological processes and are considered potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of diseases. The gelatinases are a class of MMPs that includes gelatinase A, or MMP-2 (72 kDa), and gelatinase B, or MMP-9 (92 kDa). These MMPs are found to have proteolytic activity on native collagen types and break down structural proteins in the extracellular matrix. The activity of the MMPs is found after the gel staining as transparent bands against a dark-blue background. In this book chapter, we aim to describe the detailed procedure to detect the gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cells.",

Among these, thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine and biotin can be prescribed and compounded as hard gelatin capsules. In compounding practice, a medication can be done extemporaneously, leading to a risk of error. However, a medication can also be done in advance, analytically controlled and stored. Such practice reduce the risk of error and decrease the cost, but also imposes the realization of stability studies to establish beyond-use-dates. Thiamine hydrochloride, riboflavin, pyridoxine hydrochloride, and biotin hard gelatin capsules chromatographic and microbiological methods were both validated and used to perform stability studies. Thiamine hydrochloride 50 mg hard gelatin capsules with microcrystalline cellulose and silica as excipients are stable for 6 months when stored at 25 °C/ 60% RH protected from light. Riboflavin 50 mg with microcrystalline cellulose, pyridoxine hydrochloride 50 mg with microcrystalline cellulose and biotin 40 mg with microcrystalline cellulose/silica are stable for one year when stored at 25 °C/ 60% RH protected from light. These results allow the compounding in advance of batches of 300 capsules controlled, stored, and quickly dispensed in case of an emergency, such decreasing the risk of error and/or iatrogenic event.",

Comprehensive characterization using FTIR, BET, SEM, XRD, and EDX techniques confirmed successful synthesis and functional integration of the components, with a surface area of 27.596 m2/g. Experimental trials on Yangtze River water spiked with 300 μg/L Mic-LR and turbidity ranging from 0 to 30 NTU identified optimal operating conditions: 50 mg/L coagulant dosage, pH 8, and stirring at 400 rpm. Under these parameters, the composite achieved removal efficiencies of 88 % for Mic-LR and 94 % for turbidity. Improved performance in alkaline conditions was attributed to the increased ionization of functional groups such as -COOH and -NH₂, enhancing adsorption and floc formation. The synergistic role of biochar and magnetic particles contributed to better adsorption capacity, floc stability, and overall sustainability. Reusability tests showed high efficiency over four cycles, with slight performance reduction due to active site saturation. The coagulant also effectively removed Mic-RR (85.3 %) and Mic-YR (87.1 %), and maintained stable performance in complex water matrices, showing promise as a robust, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly solution."

      "abstract": "The clinical application of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) in the treatment of liver failure faces challenges due to cell quality, short engraftment time, and limited efficacy. Here, gelatin microcryogel (GM) microcarriers with pore sizes ranging from 15 to 36 μm were tuned from mixed gelatin and glutaraldehyde to develop a 3D culture system of hUCMSCs with improved therapeutic effects. Bulk RNA sequencing and in vitro assays showed that 3D-hUCMSCs exhibited significant improvement in signaling pathways related to paracrine secretion and anti-inflammation. These 3D-hUCMSCs superior compared to 2D-hUCMSCs not only in terms of paracrine secretion, protection from oxidation, and resistance to mechanical force damage, but also had better liver function improvement effect than 2D-hUCMSCs when they were transplanted as single cells into liver injury mice. Furthermore, a gelatin sponge patch grafting (GSPG) strategy was developed to enable the direct engraftment of 3D-hUCMSCs within the GM microcarriers. The results showed that overall engraftment in the host liver was significantly improved, and the life span of transplanted hosts was extended. Our study provided a practical strategy to achieve high engraftment and long retraining time of 3D-hUCMSCs in rescuing acute liver failure with gelatin matrixes."

      "abstract": "Cancer persists as a formidable global health crisis, with conventional therapies often compromised by systemic toxicity, poor tumor specificity, and therapeutic resistance. Nanotechnology has emerged as a transformative approach, leveraging nanoscale materials to enhance drug bioavailability, enable targeted delivery, and mitigate off-target effects. Among these innovations, gelatin-based nanoparticles (GNPs), derived from collagen and endorsed by the FDA have garnered significant attention as biocompatible, biodegradable nanocarriers uniquely suited for oncology applications. GNPs address critical extracellular barriers such as inefficient tumor penetration, rapid clearance, and nonspecific biodistribution by capitalizing on gelatin's intrinsic advantages: low immunogenicity, tumor microenvironment responsiveness (pH, enzymes, redox gradients), and tunable surface functionalization. This review highlights the versatility of GNPs in overcoming these challenges through advanced strategies like ligand-mediated targeting, combinatorial therapies, and size-transformable systems that enhance tumor accumulation and therapeutic precision. Case studies across lung, breast, skin, liver, colorectal, brain, and head/neck cancers demonstrate GNPs' ability to reduce IC50 values by 2 to 4-fold, achieve >90 % apoptosis in malignant cells, and minimize damage to healthy tissues. Despite the challenges in translating gelatin-based nanocarriers from preclinical studies to clinical applications in cancer therapy, their promising preclinical performance highlights their potential as patient-centric platforms capable of advancing precision oncology. Further their adaptability, multifunctionality, and capacity for stimuli-responsive drug release underscore their potential to improve clinical outcomes, offering a targeted, low-toxicity paradigm for managing diverse malignancies."

      "abstract": "Wound infections are a primary cause of delayed wound healing, and film dressings have garnered significant attention in wound management. However, the development of biologically sourced and green-synthesized film dressings with rapid antimicrobial functionality remains an urgent technological breakthrough. In this study, we successfully developed gelatin sodium alginate/sea sheath molecularly modified berberine hydrochloride film (GS/CB). The incorporation of sea sheath powder significantly enhances the mechanical properties of the gelatin‑sodium alginate film.The calcium ions (Ca2+) provided by the sea sheath create a cross-linking effect within the sodium alginate-gelatin network, resulting in tensile properties of the GS/CB films that are 2.6 times greater than those of the control films. This enhancement allows the films to meet the requirements for wound applications. In in vitro antimicrobial experiments, the films incorporated with sodium oleate-modified berberine hydrochloride showed good antimicrobial effects, with an inhibition rate of 97.79 % against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and 98.57 % against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In in vivo wound healing experiments, the film effectively eliminated MRSA from the wound, achieving a bacterial clearance rate of 98.5 %. Compared to transparent film dressings, the GS/CB film demonstrated superior wound care efficacy and significantly accelerated wound healing. Furthermore, both in vivo and in vitro tests indicated that the film possesses excellent biocompatibility. Therefore, the GS/CB film holds great potential and application value as a new wound dressing for the treatment of infectious wounds."

The quality was evaluated on the basis of physical and barrier properties, as well as lipid oxidation for coated and uncoated chicken meat. Chicken breast meat was cut into small pieces, pasteurized, and coated with the active film solution. The active gelatin-chitosan film enriched was prepared with different concentrations of rosemary extract (0 to 2%). The application of the coating solution, with or without ultrasonic treatment was conducted. Subsequently, the samples were subjected to freeze drying for 72 h. The water activity, color, hygroscopic, and rehydration properties of the freeze-dried coated meat were measured. Moreover, the lipid oxidation of the coated vs. uncoated meat was also investigated during a 6 month storage period. Results showed that the coating can form a non-porous surface, which resists the exchange of water vapor, thereby decreasing hygroscopicity and rehydration rates. Likewise, the reduction in the color change and the level of malondialdehyde proved that the active coating allowed good preservation of the meat samples against lipid oxidation during the storage period. However, the application of coating with the use of ultrasound treatment did not positively affect lipid oxidation reduction, and an even higher value was observed in comparison to samples immersed in film forming solutions without ultrasound treatment. It can be concluded that the phenolic compounds incorporated into the film matrix had antioxidant activity, minimizing the extent of lipid oxidation in foods."

      "abstract": "When the bladder is affected by factors such as tumors, tuberculosis, or trauma, its normal structure and function can be severely damaged. At this point, bladder replacement or enlargement surgery may become necessary to restore its structure and improve the patient's quality of life. Traditional bladder reconstruction surgery, specifically ileum augmentation cystoplasty, involves a complex surgical process, along with relatively large operative wounds and possible intestinal obstruction complications. There is also an urgent need for suitable bladder replacement materials. Over the past decade, synthetic bladder scaffolds have emerged as alternatives; however, most fail to simultaneously address the issues of postoperative fibrosis and bacterial infection. To overcome these challenges, we developed an electrospun poly(L-lactic acid)/gelatin (PLLA/GEL) microfiber membrane loaded with mitomycin C (MMC). By optimizing the PLLA/GEL ratio (7 : 3), the membrane exhibited both good rigidity and excellent elasticity. The MMC-loaded fibers demonstrated sustained drug release, effectively inhibiting E. coli and S. aureus in vitro. In rat partial cystectomy models, the PLLA/GEL/MMC group showed a reduction in collagen III deposition through inhibition of the TGF-β/Smad2 pathway, as well as enhanced urothelium regeneration and promotion of angiogenesis. Notably, the membrane maintained cell viability for both urothelial cells and smooth muscle cells over 7 days, confirming its biocompatibility. These findings highlight the promising potential of the PLLA/GEL/MMC microfiber membrane not only as a material for bladder tissue engineering but also as a tool for therapeutic intervention that addresses multiple facets of bladder healing and regeneration."

      "abstract": "Wound healing is a highly complex and intricate biological process involving cellular and molecular events. Given that lumbrokinase is a fibrinolytic enzyme derived from earthworms and exhibits notable anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and pro-angiogenic functions, this study aims to investigate the development of bioactive gelatin nanofibers containing lumbrokinase (GLK) fabricated through electrospinning as a novel nanomedicine strategy for enhancing wound healing. Our results showed that reducing electrospinning time can increase cross-linking degree and decrease degradation rate to maintain an effective concentration of released LK for supporting long-term biological processes. Cells cultured with biocompatible GLK displayed good adhesion and extensive spreading, increased VEGF production, and lowered IL-6 and TNF-α secretion. The GLK with superior and multiple bioactivities was further tested for tissue regeneration potential in a rat model of skin defect. The treatment of animals with GLK shortens wound healing time, reduces damage caused by inflammation, and increases collagen production, angiogenesis, and fibroblast proliferation/epithelialization, demonstrating that the healing effect on the local wounds is comparable to that of Comfeel group. Overall, the findings from preclinical studies suggest high promise of the LK-loaded biopolymer nanofibers as bioactive dressing materials for promoting a regenerative environment and accelerating wound healing, indicating its future translational potential."

      "abstract": "Pseudoaneurysms of the splenic artery usually arise as a complication of pancreatitis. Due to the risk of rupture, treatment of the pseudoaneurysms of splenic artery is considered as a priority in the management of pancreatitis. While endovascular embolization is an established minimally invasive and effective technique for the treatment of splenic artery pseudoaneurysms, however, in some cases endovascular embolization may not be feasible, owing to the difficulties in accessing the distal small pseudoaneurysms or due to financial constraints. In such a scenario, percutaneous image guided direct puncture and embolization of the pseudoaneurysms is a valuable option. While most of the previous publications have reported on the use of n‑butyl cyanoacrylate, coils and thrombin for percutaneous embolization of splenic artery pseudoaneurysms, however, these agents may not be easily accessible to many health facilities in emergency situations and their cost may limit their use. In this report, we describe a novel technique of percutaneous embolization of splenic artery pseudoaneurysms with Sequential Aspiration and injection of a Mixture of gelatin-based hemostatic agent and autologous blood clot followed by suture coiling for Effective Embolization of splenic artery pseudoaneurysm by interventional Radiologist (SAMEER technique).

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: During spinal surgery, management of intraoperative bleeding and effective hemostasis are required to clearly visualize the surgical field and to safely perform procedures and positive postoperative outcomes. However, it is challenging to stop bleeding from the venous plexus around the dural sac due to the potential risk of neural tissue damage. We aimed to develop hemostatic sheets with appropriate characteristics for spinal surgery, such as softness, appropriate thickness, biodegradability, thrombin bioactivity, and minimal water-induced expansion. METHODS: Hemostatic sheets were made by dissolving bovine bone-derived gelatin in water and aerating it to form foam, followed by freeze-drying, crosslinking, and thrombin-soaking. Sheets A to H were produced with different gelatin concentrations, foam densities, and crosslinking times by additional heat treatment. The sheets were then soaked in thrombin solution for enhanced hemostasis. Material properties, such as density, tensile strength, biodegradability, and hemostatic capacity, were evaluated. Sheet efficacy was further assessed with liver bleeding and spinal venous plexus bleeding models in a miniature pig. RESULTS: High-density gelatin sheets showed stable shape retention in wet conditions and robust tensile strength. Sheets with higher density and more crosslinking had prolonged persistence in the pepsin test and lower biodegradability in vivo. Sheet B, produced from a 4% gelatin solution with heating at 155°C for 4 h, showed the best balance of properties, such as no deformation cracks, rapid water absorption, minimal expansion, and faster degradation within 10 weeks, compared with TachoSil and other sheets. In hemostasis models, Sheet B outperformed Avitene and TachoSil, achieving higher success rates in spinal (four out of six sites) and liver bleeding (five out of five sites) models. CONCLUSIONS: A thrombin-loaded hemostatic sheet produced from 4% gelatin solution with a short heating time for crosslinking demonstrated well-balanced material properties, such as shape retention, biodegradability, and wet expansion rate, which resulted in effective hemostasis in in vivo models. These advances may contribute to surgical hemostatic applications."

This study explores one-pot-synthesized gelatin microspheres devoid of glutaraldehyde as a novel biomaterial for OA management. Focusing on the Ext1 gene, critical for cartilage development and downregulated in OA, we investigated its restoration and immune regulation using gelatin microspheres cultured with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Methods: OA patients undergoing knee replacement surgery have their lateral compartment (remote zone) and medial compartment (lesion zone) cartilage collected for transcriptomic testing. The differential gene Ext1 is identified, and the expression of immune regulatory genes is examined. MSCs were cultured with gelatin microspheres to evaluate their compatibility and ability to promote cell attachment. The effects of the gelatin microspheres on Ext1 gene overexpression, immune regulation, and OA symptom mitigation were investigated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results: OA patients exhibit decreased expression of the Ext1 gene in the medial compartment (lesion zone) cartilage area, accompanied by abnormal expression of immune regulatory genes. The study demonstrated that the gelatin microspheres exhibited excellent compatibility with MSCs and facilitated their attachment. Culturing MSCs with the microspheres led to enhanced overexpression of the Ext1 gene, which is crucial for cartilage growth and development. Additionally, the microspheres regulated immune responses, contributing to a reduction in OA symptoms. Conclusion: This study introduces an innovative therapeutic strategy for osteoarthritis using gelatin microspheres cultured with MSCs. By promoting Ext1 gene overexpression and regulating immune responses, these microspheres effectively mitigate OA symptoms. The findings highlight the potential of this biomaterial as a promising treatment option for OA.",

The cell viability of Ef-20,420 before and after encapsulation was 8.51 ± 0.09 log CFU/mL and 8.36 ± 0.07 log CFU/mL, respectively, which remained generally stable. The final product can be stored at 4 °C for up to 12 months. The composite microcapsules were determined to be formed by hydrogen bond and electrostatic interaction through different characterization methods. After exposure to SGF, the composite microcapsules showed a viable cell count reduction of only 1.37 ± 0.13 log CFU/mL. With the addition of PS, the sustained release time of the bacteria in SIF was extended by 60 min. Following high-temperature treatment at 80 ± 0.5 °C for 3 min, the protective effect of the composite microcapsules maintaining a viable cell count at 6.58 ± 0.19 log CFU/mL. After 25 days of storage at 4 ± 0.2 °C, the bacterial count in the composite microcapsules decreased from 8.50 ± 0.04 to 7.10 ± 0.12 log CFU/mL.

In this study, we developed a multifunctional nanoplatform GNPs-DOX/R848 that combined immunotherapy and chemotherapy for the treatment of melanoma, in which gelatin nanoparticles (GNPs) were loaded with the immunomodulatory agent resiquimod (R848) and the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (DOX). GNPs possessed inherent immunomodulatory properties; when combined with R848, they induced a more pronounced polarization of M1-like macrophages by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Meanwhile, GNPs effectively delivered R848 and DOX to tumor cells, promoting stronger therapeutic effects of the drugs, which strongly induced the immunogenic cell death triggered by DOX, leading to the infiltration of T cells into the tumor tissue. The treatment of melanoma demonstrated that GNPs-DOX/R848 significantly reduced tumor volume, enhanced the therapeutic effects of chemotherapy, providing a new approach for the combined treatment of cancer with immunotherapy and chemotherapy."

The development of new antimicrobial agents with dual antimicrobial and antibiofilm capabilities is crucial to mitigate AMR. Nitric oxide (NO) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent which has shown promise in treating infections due to its multiple antimicrobial mechanisms. However, the high reactivity of NO poses a challenge for effective delivery to infection sites. We investigated the antimicrobial and antibiofilm capabilities, and the shelf life, of NO-releasing gelatin nanoparticles (GNP/NO) against three common hospital-acquired pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. The synthesised GNP/NO were found to be cytocompatible and exhibited significant antimicrobial and antibiofilm efficacies against the tested pathogens in both nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor conditions. Furthermore, we found that the antimicrobial capabilities of GNP/NO were maintained for up to 6 months post synthesis, against Staphylococcus aureus (2.4 log), Escherichia coli (1.2 log) and Candida albicans (3 log) under nutrient-poor conditions. Our study demonstrates the use of a novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial with a prolonged shelf life for the treatment of infections. These findings offer an effective alternative to traditional antibiotics which would contribute to mitigating the current global AMR threat resulting from antibiotic overuse."

Advancements in additive manufacturing present opportunities for graft customization through enhanced scaffold design. In bioprinting, an additive manufacturing process, the \"bioink\" serves as the medium to carry cells but also as a scaffold by imparting form and mechanical attributes to the printed object. In this study, the impact of cross-linked gelatin microparticles (GMPs) on rheological properties and printability of carboxylated agarose (CA) bioink as well as matrix deposition by human nasal chondrocytes (hNCs) was investigated. The introduction of GMPs yielded stiffer bioink formulations, with lower sol-gel transitions that retained the exceptional printability of CA. GMPs served as foci for the attachment of hNCs, improving cellular distribution and bridging the deposited extracellular matrix. After 4 weeks in chondrogenic culture, GMPs containing printed constructs showed enhanced toughness approaching that of the lower end of the spectrum of native cartilage tissue. The incorporation of proteinaceous microparticles might serve as a general concept to promote cellular function in polysaccharide-based bioinks and opens another avenue for engineering 3D-bioprinted microenvironments.",

Innovative hydrogels improve postoperative care and rehabilitation with their anti-adhesion, antibacterial, and hemostatic properties.

This hydrogel is specifically tailored for intestinal perforations. Upon hydrolysis, PEG-NHS forms a protective barrier that effectively prevents adhesion to surrounding normal tissues. Furthermore, the integration of PPy-GelMA significantly extends the degradation duration of the hydrogel, from 24 to 48 h. In a mouse model of intestinal perforation, the AA-A30 hydrogel demonstrated remarkable efficacy in inhibiting inflammation and preventing tissue adhesion by modulating the expression of both inflammatory and tissue adhesion-related factors, such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and the ratio of tPA to PAI-1. These findings underscore the considerable potential of AA-A30 for the therapeutic management of intestinal perforations."

Additionally, due to the barrier functions of the anterior segment tissues, traditional treatment methods often suffer from low efficiency and significant side effects, presenting urgent challenges that need to be addressed. Gelatin inherently possesses excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, and when combined with its unique cell adhesion sequences and the ability to flexibly modulate mechanical and optical properties through physical and chemical modifications, it demonstrates tremendous potential in anterior segment tissue engineering and drug delivery applications. Compared to conventional surgical and eye drop therapies, gelatin-based materials can reduce the risk of complications, enhance drug bioavailability, extend drug retention time, and achieve personalized and precise treatment for various anterior segment diseases through technologies such as 3D bioprinting. However, gelatin-based materials have limitations, including low mechanical strength and thermal stability. Therefore, this paper focuses on recent research regarding the application of gelatin-based materials in anterior segment diseases, systematically summarizing their advantages in treatment, the challenges they face, and their developmental potential."

This study explored nitrogen cold plasma's impact on the structure and thermal stability of mucilage-gelatin aerogels (MGA). Aerogels were prepared using marshmallow root mucilage and gelatin in a 1:1 ratio and gelatin-only as a blank under different pH conditions (5 and 7). Rheological and texture analyses identified pH 7 as optimal. Aerogels at pH 7 were then exposed to cold plasma for varying durations (0, 3, and 6 min). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential thermal analysis (DTA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed enhanced thermal stability and structural changes with increased plasma exposure. Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed functional group changes, and contact angle measurements showed that 3 min of plasma treatment increased hydrophilicity (88.37-82.05°), while 6 min enhanced hydrophobicity in 1:1 MGA (93.27°). BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) analyses of the MGA samples revealed changes in surface area (2.9-4.33 m2/g after 3 min of plasma) and BJH (Barrett-Joyner-Halenda) pore volume (0.004-0.02 cm3/g), with a complex trend over time. This study highlights nitrogen cold plasma's potential to enhance mucilage-based biopolymer aerogels, paving the way for advanced materials via optimized treatments."

      "abstract": "Nanocatalytic platforms are promising in cancer therapeutics via combining multiple treatments, which can be leveraged through the metabolic dysfunction in cancer progression. However, the lack of effective tumor delivery platforms hampers this approach. Here, a gelatin-based platform is designed that is preloaded with gold nanoparticles and photothermal polypyrrole (GNPs@AuNPs-PPy) with an acid-induced doping enhancement. Benefiting from the tumor associated overexpression of H2O2, peroxidase-like Au nanoparticles induce a burst of oxidative reactive oxygen species in the local tumor microenvironment (TME). Subsequent orchestration of redox surroundings recruits immune cells, showcasing an effective antineoplastic pathway. Under near infrared light (NIR) irradiation, nanohybrids exhibit dual pH/NIR enhanced drug release within the TME, while allowing for multimodal imaging-guided theranostics. Leveraging this modality, GNPs@AuNPs-PPy delivers quercetin (a natural antitumor mediator) in TME, boosting anti-tumor therapy. The gelatin-mediated nanomedicine provides an alternative platform for combinatorial dynamic antitumor treatment."

Recent studies have found that dissolvable microneedles can effectively promote repair of infected wounds. Therefore, gelatin microneedles (CeO2-CIP MN) doped with cerium dioxide nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) were rationally designed and prepared based on the characteristics of the microenvironment of bacterial infection. The results of in vitro studies showed that CeO2-CIP MN possessed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and antioxidant activity. Importantly, in the seawater-immersed V. vulnificus infected wound model, CeO2-CIP MN effectively killed V. vulnificus, scavenged wound reactive oxygen species (ROS), and promoted cell migration, which subsequently accelerated the repair of the infected wound. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that CeO2-CIP MN can effectively promote the repair of V. vulnificus infected wounds, and also provide ideas for innovative treatment modalities for marine-related diseases."

      "abstract": "Due to the limited regenerative ability of bone tissue, bone injury repair has always been a complicated problem in clinical treatment. Bone tissue engineering based on cell delivery is an effective method to repair bone defects, but it also puts forward strict requirements on the scaffold used in the repair process and the survival rate of cell inoculation. To address this challenge, we constructed a bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) laden gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel to integrate in silk fibroin (SF) /nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAp) scaffold, building a dual architecture to achieve enhanced angiogenesis and bone regeneration. The GelMA hydrogel prepared by visible photo-crosslinking showed good cell loading capacity, and the multi-layered-oriented pores of the scaffold provided a suitable microenvironment for cell proliferation and nutrient exchange. We further explored the effects of this \"dual-system\" complex on BMSCs and in a critical-sized rat cranial defect model. The results showed that BMSCs@GelMA-SF/nHAp composite scaffold with directional pore structure was more conducive to the repair of skull defects in rats due to the faster rate of vascularization and osteogenesis, indicating the developed gel-scaffold complex would be a promising therapeutic strategy for the repair of bone defects regeneration.",

      "abstract": "The recurrence rate of spontaneous pneumothorax (collapsed lung) is 30 % after basic conservative treatments, and it can reach up to 20 % after surgery due to the limited effectiveness of current surgical techniques. This highlights the need for the development of new, effective treatment approaches supported by biomaterials. Therefore, we aimed to develop a biomaterial that does not restrict the aerodynamic movements of the lungs, is resistant to lung pressure, and can withstand the movements during inhalation and exhalation,to prevent and treat pneumothorax recurrence. For this purpose, biodegradable matrices were prepared using polycaprolactone (PCL), gelatin (GEL), and amoxicillin (AMX), which is a broad-spectrum antibiotic. The matrices were designed with a nanofiber/net (NFN) structure, targeting appropriate degradation rates and mechanical strength. NFN matrices with randomly arranged and bead-free fibers were produced by electrospinning PCL/GEL and PCL/GEL-AMX solutions in different ratios. The incorporation of AMX reduced the fiber diameter, while the addition of GEL increased the fiber diameters, resulting in fibrous matrices with diameters ranging from 194 nm to 1,100 nm. Additionally, adding GEL and/or AMX to the structure caused the fiber surfaces to resemble tree bark, and spider web-like nano networks formed between the fibers. These formations were particularly homogeneous and dense in the (7:3) PCL/GEL-5AMX group. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis showed that the elemental composition of the fibers and the nano-networks was similar. The elastic moduli of the matrix groups ranged from 3.97 ± 0.74 MPa to 19.02 ± 1.91 MPa, which was found to be suitable for the target range for lung tissue. Hydrolytic degradation studies indicated that nano-networks remained present in the structure after 5 weeks, and 55-68 % of the loaded AMX was released within 14 days. In the AMX-loaded groups, both Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Streptococcus aureus (S. aureus) growth were inhibited, with the most effective inhibition observed in the (7:3) PCL/GEL-5AMX group. In conclusion, it was assessed that the spider web-like nano-networks, which increased with the GEL and AMX ratio in the solution, mimicked the structure of lung alveoli at the nanoscale due to their large surface area and small pore size between the fibers. Particularly, the (7:3) PCL/GEL-5AMX NFN matrix could be used as a new and effective alternative material in pneumothorax therapy.",

      "abstract": "Cartilage damage is common in sports injuries and cartilage-related diseases, such as degenerative joint and rheumatic disorders. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is a widely used cell-based therapy for repairing cartilage damage in clinical practice. In this procedure, a patient's chondrocytes are isolated, cultured in vitro to expand the cell population, and then implanted into the damaged site. However, in vitro expansion of chondrocytes on standard 2D culture surfaces leads to dedifferentiation (loss of the chondrocyte phenotype), and the delivery of detached cells has proven to be ineffective. To overcome these limitations, the matrix-assisted ACI (MACI) procedure was developed. In MACI, matrices such as hydrogels and microspheres are used as cell carriers or scaffolds to deliver expanded chondrocytes, enhancing cell viability and precision delivery. To streamline the two key steps of MACI-cell expansion and delivery-this study aims to investigate various configurations of gelatin-based hydrogels for their potential to support both cell expansion and delivery as a single step. This study evaluated gelatin microspheres (Gel MS), micronized photo-crosslinked GelMA microparticles (GelMA MP), and bulky GelMA hydrogels containing cells (GelMA HG). Cell growth, maintenance of the chondrocyte phenotype, and cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) production were assessed in pellet cultures for cells grown on/in these carriers, compared with cells cultured on tissue culture-treated polystyrene (TCP). Our results demonstrate that normal human knee articular chondrocytes exhibit robust growth on Gel MS and form aggregates enriched with glycosaminoglycan-rich ECM. Gel MS outperformed both GelMA MP and GelMA HG as a cell carrier by both supporting long-term cell growth with reduced dedifferentiation and precision delivery."

This study investigates the physicochemical and functional properties of gelatin extracted from Yanbian cattle bones using three different methods: acid, alkaline, and papain enzymatic hydrolysis. The extraction yields and quality of gelatin were evaluated based on hydroxyproline content, gel strength, viscosity, amino acid composition, molecular weight distribution, and structural integrity. Specifically, A gelatin, prepared using 0.075 mol/L hydrochloric acid, achieved the highest yield (18.64%) among the acid-extraction methods. B gelatin, extracted with 0.1 mol/L sodium hydroxide, achieved the highest yield (21.06%) among the alkaline-extraction methods. E gelatin, obtained through papain hydrolysis, exhibited the highest yield (25.25%) among the enzymatic methods. Gelatin extracted via papain enzymatic hydrolysis not only retained better protein structure but also exhibited higher hydroxyproline content (19.13 g/100 g), gel strength (259 g), viscosity (521.67 cP), and superior thermal stability. Structural analyses conducted using SDS-PAGE, GPC, FTIR, XRD, and CD spectroscopy confirmed that papain extraction more effectively preserved the natural structure of collagen. Furthermore, amino acid composition analysis revealed that gelatin extracted via papain hydrolysis contained higher levels of essential residues, such as glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline, emphasizing the mild and efficient nature of enzymatic treatment. These findings suggest that, compared with acid and alkaline extraction methods, enzymatic hydrolysis has potential advantages in gelatin production. Yanbian cattle bone gelatin shows promise as an alternative source for halal gelatin production. This study also provides insights into optimizing gelatin production to enhance its functionality and sustainability."

The hydrogels were covalently cross-linked using polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (PEGDE 500), and the interaction between the components was confirmed via FTIR. The properties of the resulting hydrogels were examined, including gel-fraction volume, swelling degree in different media, mechanical properties, pore size, cytotoxicity, and the ability to absorb and release analgesics (lidocaine, novocaine, sodium diclofenac). The hydrogel's resistance to enzymatic action by protease was enhanced both through chemical cross-linking and physical interactions between gelatin and alginate. The absorption capacity of the hydrogels, reaching 90 g per dm2 of the hydrogel dressing, indicates their potential for absorbing wound exudates. It was demonstrated that the antiseptic (chlorhexidine) contained in the structured gelatin-alginate hydrogels can be released into an infected substrate, resulting in a significant inhibition of pathogenic microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Aspergillus niger). These results clearly demonstrate that the obtained hydrogel materials can serve as non-traumatic dressings for the treatment of chronic and/or infected wounds."

This study aimed to determine the effect of Patin skin gelatin on increasing macrophages and fibroblasts and reducing the diameter of traumatic ulcers in Wistar rats. An experimental laboratory study with a post-test-only control group design was conducted. Ulcers were induced on the labial mucosa of the mandible in rats using thermal induction.

Rats were euthanized on days 3, 5, and 7, and ulcerated mucosal tissue was biopsied to count macrophages and fibroblasts using an Olympus microscope. Results showed significant macrophage and fibroblast count differences between the gelatin and placebo treatment groups. Patin skin gelatin at all concentrations increased the number of fibroblasts and decreased ulcer diameters significantly compared to the control group (p<0.05). Patin skin gelatin effectively enhanced fibroblast cell proliferation and reduced ulcer size over the 7-day treatment period.

The scaffold incorporates varying dosages of silybin (Sil) through a mixture of electrospinning and thermal-induced phase separation (TIPS) techniques. Assessments of surface shape, porosity, compressive strength, water contact angle, degradation rate, releasing profile, hemolysis, and cell proliferation were among the investigations carried out to appraise the manufactured scaffolds. In vivo evaluation utilized a rat calvaria defect model, with histological analysis employed to assess the results. The scaffolds exhibited porosity within the range of 70-90%, and those containing silybin demonstrated lower compressive strength and contact angle, along with a higher degradation rate compared to those without silybin. Release experiments revealed a 61.09% release of silybin after 28 days. In both in vivo and in vitro assessments, the PCL/GNF/NC/Sil1% scaffold displayed superior cell proliferation and bone healing properties compared to other groups. These findings suggest the potential efficacy of silybin in bone defect treatment, warranting further investigation in future research."

METHODS: This study conducted a retrospective analysis of 1,026 patients who underwent CT-guided lung biopsy at our center from January 2022 to July 2024. After propensity score matching (PSM) to minimize the impact of confounding variables like smoke, lesion diameter, and tract length, 338 patients were ultimately included and assigned to the sealant group (169 patients) or the non-sealing group (169 patients) according to whether using the gelatin sponge particles sealing after needle withdraw to the subpleural area. Clinical and operative characteristics data were collated from electronic medical records (EMR) and Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS). A multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors of pneumothorax. RESULTS: In the sealing group, the incidence of pneumothorax was 14.8%, whereas it was significantly higher in the non-sealing group at 23.7% (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the chest tube placement rates of 3% and 1.8% (p = 0.723). Importantly, no significant complications, such as air embolism, were observed in either group. A multivariate logistic regression analysis, using a propensity score-matched cohort, identified patient emphysema (OR = 2.35 [1.22-4.51], p = 0.01) and the tract length (OR = 1.25 [1.01-1.55], p = 0.042) as significant risk factors for pneumothorax. Furthermore, gelatin sponge particle needle-tract sealing demonstrated a marked and statistically significant reduction in the risk of pneumothorax (OR = 0.5 [0.27-0.91], p = 0.024), highlighting the distinct advantages and clinical value of this treatment in preventing such complications. CONCLUSIONS: The gelatin sponge particle subpleural sealing technique can effectively reduce the incidence of pneumothorax in patients undergoing percutaneous CT-guided lung biopsy.",

      "abstract": "The advancement of 3D printing technology offers a sophisticated solution for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Several printable hydrogels have been developed with specific designs for certain tissues. However, there are few effective 3D-printed hydrogels for cartilage tissue engineering due to challenges with the hydrogel printability and the redifferentiation capacity of the articular chondrocytes on the hydrogel. This research study combined a PEG-PLA copolymer with gelatin to develop 3D-printed scaffolds for cartilage regeneration. Different hydrogel samples were prepared and studied regarding the effects of PLA chain length, gelatin content, and cross-linker concentration on the mechanical properties, swelling ability, and degradability of the hydrogels. An increase in the swelling ratio was observed, resulting in diminished compressive properties and accelerated degradation of the hydrogels with increased gelatin or decreased cross-linker and PLA chain length. Porcine articular chondrocytes were seeded onto the hydrogel scaffolds to assess cell adhesion, proliferation, and redifferentiation capability. Hydrogels with high swelling ability promoted the initial adhesion of cells on the scaffold, hence significantly increasing chondrocyte proliferation within 2 weeks of culture. Lowering the compressive modulus by increasing gelatin content improved chondrogenic redifferentiation. Glycosaminoglycan secretion was significantly enhanced when cells grew on hydrogels with greater amounts of gelatin. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining of the cell-loaded hydrogels showed clusters of cells with a dense accumulation of a type II collagen network, a basis component of the cartilaginous matrix. Neither the PLA chain length nor the cross-linker amount affected chondrogenic function. The present study demonstrates that the PEG-PLA/gelatin hydrogels with increasing amounts of gelatin provide an optimal combination of swelling ratio, compressive modulus, and degradation rate, resulting in an appropriate environment to support the growth and redifferentiation of articular chondrocytes. This 3D-printed PEG-PLA/gelatin hydrogel will be useful for cartilage tissue engineering and possibly contribute to a new approach for cartilage defect treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bone-graft substitutes are a frequently employed method for the clinical reconstruction of osseous bone defects, and research on synthetic biomaterials is currently ongoing. Absorbable hemostatic gelatin sponge and hydroxyapatite-chitosan nanocomposites (nHAp/CS) have gained popularity in recent years because of their inherent characteristics: osteogenesis, osteoconductivity, osteoinductivity, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 1) a gelatin-based hemostatic sponge (Surgispon) and 2) a combination of a weight ratio of 75/25 nHAp/CS composite with a Surgispon for osteogenic potential in the treatment of full-thickness segmental osseous defects in the radius of rabbits. METHODS: The 18 New Zealand rabbits had 10-mm-induced segmental diaphyseal defects of the left limb radius and were randomly allocated into three groups: group I left the defects untreated (control group), group II used a Surgispon, and group III had a weight ratio of 75/25 nHAp/CS composite wrapped with a Surgispon. Quantitative evaluation of the bone repair at the defect site in each group (n = 6), radiographic, gross, computed tomography (CT), and histopathological examinations were performed at 6 weeks (n = 3) and 12 weeks (n = 3) postoperatively. RESULTS: The quantitative statistical analysis of various evaluation methods at 6 weeks post-implantation demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference between the groups (p > 0.05). The statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between groups I and II, while groups I and III, were evident 12 weeks postoperatively. CONCLUSION: The findings of the radiographic, macroscopic, CT, and histopathological analyses firmly demonstrate that the combination of a 75/25 weight ratio composite of nHAp/CS with Surgispon is more effective than Surgispon alone in its ability to significantly increase bone formation. This could provide a prospective option for treating segmental bone defects.",

Herein, we implanted Mo2Ti2C3 MXene gelatin-chitosan hydrogels into the osteoarthritis knee joint in mice and treated with 808 nm laser radiation. We investigated MXene hydrogel structure and near infrared radiation (NIR) effect on cell biocompatibility, cartilage matrix synthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS)production and inflammation in vitro. In vivo anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) OA model treated with MXene hydrogel and NIR exhibits delayed osteoarthritis progression with fewer osteophyte and wider articular space, reduced cartilage lesion, lower Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) score, higher glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content, higher number of aggrecan and col-II positive cells. Mo2Ti2C3 MXene hydrogel with NIR reduced M1 macrophage related IL-1β and IL-6, increased M2 macrophage related TGF-β and IL-10 in cartilage in OA. Mo2Ti2C3 MXene hydrogel with NIR attenuated ROS and chondrocytes apoptosis in vivo. Mo2Ti2C3 MXene hydrogel may provide a new strategy in treatment of OA."

While diagnosis is straightforward, treatment remains challenging. Noninvasive therapies like eye drops are preferred, but severe neurotrophic keratopathy may require surgical interventions. This study explores gelatin-based hydrogels as noninvasive alternatives for corneal repair. Four photo-cross-linkable hydrogels with gelatin and riboflavin phosphate (RFP) were evaluated: a control and variants incorporating 2.5% dextran (D), 0.4% hyaluronic acid (HA), or 1% methylcellulose (MC). In vitro assessments included physicochemical properties, biocompatibility, and release kinetics alongside ex vivo wound healing assays. The gelatin-RFP hydrogel maintained corneal transparency, while additives reduced it. Dextran slowed compound release, and HA and MC reduced the release rate of larger molecules. All hydrogels showed excellent biocompatibility, and ex vivo models confirmed re-epithelialization, though slower than controls. The unmodified gelatin-RFP hydrogel demonstrated the best potential for corneal tissue engineering, supporting its future clinical translation."

However, it exposes risks during post-harvest storage, threatening substantial losses in rice quality and quantity. Hence, this study developed a cinnamon oil-chitosan:gelatin film (CO-C:G film) with the parameters as the chitosan:gelatin ratio (C:G = 1:1 and 1:2), cinnamon oil (CO) contents (0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0%) and thickness film levels (0.165, 0.183, and 0.287 mm) to inhibit three fungal species, Rhizopus oryzae 01, R. microsporus 01, and Syncephalastrum racemosum 01, and control rice weevil infestation on paddy rice at a variety of water activities, such as 0.71 aw and 0.95 aw, at room temperature. The results revealed that at 0.95 aw, the fungal growth rate and rice weevil's mortality were impacted significantly by all parameters of the CO-C:G film (p < 0.05). Especially, the CO-C:G film with 1.25% CO and C:G = 1:1 at a thickness film of 0.287 mm inhibited all observed fungi and rice weevils better than the CO-C:G film's other parameters. The inhibition of the CO-C:G film for these fungi ranged from 66% to 72.6%. Likewise, 80-100% of rice weevils were mortal when paddy rice was treated with the CO-C:G film on the 12th or 15th day of treatment depending on the water activity of paddy rice grains. The findings of this study provide insights for researchers, agricultural experts, and the food industry, highlighting the need to establish effective and sustainable strategies for rice preservation."

      "abstract": "The study investigated gelatin extraction from chicken skin-head-feet (SHF) blend using conventional and ultrasound-assisted methods with food-grade acetic and citric acids. Ultrasound pretreatment was introduced as an intervention in the extraction process, eliminating the need for alkali hydrolysis and significantly reducing the processing time. The gelatin yield, gel clarity, textural parameters, and functional properties were noticeably improved with ultrasound pretreatment. Higher (p< 0.05) solubility was observed in ultrasound-treated gelatin relative to traditionally extracted gelatin at different pH levels. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra revealed characteristic bands corresponding to Amide A, B, I, II, and III. Ultrasonication enhanced α-helical structure by reorganizing protein conformations and stabilizing α-helix regions. The rheological properties, gel strength, and viscosity significantly (p< 0.05) increased with ultrasound-assisted extraction. The SDS-PAGE profile of gelatin was compared with the commercial pork skin gelatin and found to possess two distinct α-chains (α1 and α2) and β chain. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry revealed the presence of collagen α1 and α2 chains as major components. This sustainable approach transformed poultry waste into a valuable resource, fostering the recovery of gelatin with improved functional attributes.",

      "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic disorder affecting millions worldwide. Recent advancements suggest that combining therapies can significantly improve AD treatment outcomes and mitigate the challenges of long-term drug use, particularly with corticosteroids. In this study, we developed a 3D-printed hydrogel composed of gelatin (Gel) and dialdehyde starch (DAS), capable of encapsulating and delivering hydrocortisone (HC). DAS was synthesized via an oxidation reaction, introducing aldehyde groups that facilitated hydrogel formation with Gel through imine bond formation (Schiff base reaction). By adjusting the Gel/DAS ratio, we formulated inks with suitable rheological properties for extrusion-based 3D printing, an approach not yet fully exploited in this context. The resulting Gel/DAS network successfully encapsulated HC, as demonstrated by characterization analyses. The printed hydrogel exhibited a well-defined microstructure, significant water absorption and retention capabilities, and excellent stability. HC release followed a controlled mechanism consistent with Korsmeyer-Peppas kinetics. In an in vivo model, the 3D-printed hydrogel containing HC showed therapeutic efficacy comparable to conventional HC treatments in alleviating AD symptoms in mice. Additionally, the hydrogel significantly reduced myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and increased non-protein thiol (NPSH) levels in the dorsal skin of DNCB-exposed mice, underscoring its therapeutic potential.",

      "abstract": "Water-borne infections are considered as one of the major risky concerns regarding the sanitary state of water bodies dedicated to drinking water supply. Therefore, the employment of environmentally benign materials in water/wastewater treatment is an indispensable aspect to solve the water crisis problem in an eco-friendly and economic manner. This study describes the synthesis, characterization, and disinfection potency of different formulas of gelatin-based Gum Arabic composites, for the first time. SEM, XRD, FTIR, ζ-potential, and swelling tests were used to assess their physicochemical properties, which revealed the enhanced compatibility and miscibility with increasing Gum Arabic concentration. The formula of GEL/50%GA showed more homogenously distributed pores as visualized by SEM with noticeable shifts in the characteristic FTIR-band and more negatively charged surface, reflecting the considerable stability as indicated by ζ-potential. Besides, it also had superior hydrophilic and swellability levels. Interestingly, the results of antimicrobial activity showed the susceptibility of broad-spectrum microbes against examined composites, especially with elevating the concentration of Gum Arabic incorporated in the composite. As a natural alternative disinfectant, the as-prepared composites (3 and 10% W/V) were evaluated in the disinfection of real wastewater samples. The results revealed that GEL/50%GA (10% W/V) exhibited a noticeable reduction in total plate count by 45.62 ± 1.48% and 37.48 ± 1.63% and in coliforms by 58.43 ± 2.07% and 40.88 ± 2.24% for municipal and industrial effluents, respectively. However, the microbial metabolic activity via MTT assay was diminished by more than 50% in both effluents; denoting the efficient inhibiting capability of GEL supplemented with GA films in restricting microbial viability even in unculturable microbes. Overall, the antagonistic activity of examined composites offers promising insights for recruitment in different disciplines such as anti-biofouling membranes, food coating, dietary supplements, wound healing, and drug delivery.",

Current attempts tend to develop multi-drug loaded patches with spatial design. Herein, we present a multifunctional microneedle patch that integrates different drugs into separated regions for wound treatment. The microneedle patch is composed of silk fibroin-methacryloyl (SilMA) as the base, loaded with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and has gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) tips loaded with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The backing is endowed with antimicrobial properties by AgNPs act as an antimicrobial barrier against bacterium invasion. In addition, the tips encapsulated with VEGF can effectively promote cell proliferation and angiogenesis, which is favorable for wound repair. Based on these characteristics, such an integrated microneedle system significantly prevented bacterial infection and promoted wound healing in vivo. Therefore, it is conceived that such a system can find more practical values in wound healing and other fields."

Salvianolic acid B (SAB) demonstrates promising applications in the treatment of fibrotic diseases, including scarring. This study prepared biodegradable gelatin (Gel) and poly(lactic-co-ε-caprolactone) (PLCL) nanofibrous membranes using electrospinning technology and functionalized them with salvianolic acid B to create fibrous membrane dressings with anti-scarring properties. The resulting Gel/PLCL/SAB (GPS) fibrous membrane exhibited good mechanical properties and biodegradability. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the fibrous membranes of Gel/PLCL containing 0.5 wt% SAB (GPS0.5) exhibited good cytocompatibility, regulated macrophage function and polarization, and inhibited fibrosis-related genes, including CD36, α-SMA, and collagen I. In a mouse model of full-thickness skin defects, the GPS0.5 fibrous membrane effectively modulated the immune microenvironment and promoted vascular regeneration, thereby accelerating skin healing. Furthermore, the GPS0.5 fibrous membrane reduced the expression of CD36 and TGF-β1, downregulated collagen I and III, and promoted the regeneration of hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and other appendages, ultimately reducing scar formation. Thus, SAB-loaded Gel/PLCL fibrous membranes hold potential as bifunctional skin dressings that promote wound healing and inhibit fibrosis."

This function is compromised upon meniscus injury or treatment by meniscectomy. 3D printing of meniscus implants has emerged as a promising alternative treatment, as it allows for precise mimicry of the meniscus architecture. In this study, silk fibroin (SF) known for its excellent mechanical properties is used to fabricate hydrogels for 3D bioprinting with infrapatellar fat pad-derived mesenchymal stem cells (IFP-MSCs). Extracellular matrix (ECM) derived from bovine menisci and gelatin are added to 10% SF to promote cell adhesion and printability. To examine the mutual influence of cells and biomaterial, experiments are conducted with and without IFP-MSCs. The cells are found to influence crosslinking, β-sheet formation, and mechanical strength. Variations between printed and casted hydrogels are identified for cell number, metabolic activity, secondary structure, and mechanical strength. Remarkably, the printed hydrogels with IFP-MSCs exhibited a compressive Young's modulus of 0.16 MPa, which closely resembled that of human osteoarthritic menisci. After initial low viability, IFP-MSCs in the casted hydrogels are able to proliferate within the biomaterial. The chondrogenic differentiation medium upregulated the expression of chondrogenic markers in the casted hydrogels, indicating promising prospects for future meniscus tissue engineering (TE)."

However, developing a facile and green strategy to fabricate nanofibrous aerogel with specific wettability remains challenging. Herein, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanofiber incorporated graphene oxide (GO)/gelatin composite aerogels were prepared, and the obtained aerogels were modified with methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) by chemical vapor deposition. The entire fabrication process was completed without usage of organic solvents. When exposed to different oils and organic solvents, the as-prepared nanofibrous aerogels showed exceptional absorption capacity. Due to high elasticity of the aerogels, it was possible to recover oils by mechanical squeezing. In addition, it was found that oils could be selectively absorbed from oil/water mixtures by the composite aerogels with superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity to realize effective separation of oil and water. Importantly, surfactant-stabilized water-in-oil emulsions could also be separated by the composite aerogels without external pressure. Furthermore, the aerogels could be used to continuously collect oil pollutants from oil/water mixtures with a simple pumping device. The current work offered an environmentally friendly method for creating superwetting nanofibrous aerogels for wastewater treatment."

Here, we report the facile route for the fabrication of the bio-sourced pH-responsive hydrogels based on κ-carrageenan and gelatin, with properties desirable for the treatment of versatile skin disorders. The extensive characterization revealed differences in physicochemical properties due to chemical modifications of the hydrogels. Porosity ranged from 21.67% to 95.81%. By modifying κ-carrageenan hydrogels with gelatin, the Young's modulus values increased proportionally with the gelatin content, ranging from 0.23 to 2.90 MPa, while native κ-carrageenan hydrogels had the lowest values (0.12-0.42 MPa) and native gelatin hydrogels had the highest (10.85-18.03 MPa). Native κ-carrageenan hydrogels exhibited the most pronounced swelling (18.6-27.0), followed by gelatin-modified κ-carrageenan hydrogels (6.5-23.0) and native gelatin hydrogels (7.8-9.0). The native κ-carrageenan hydrogels also displayed the highest water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) (259.99 ± 16-279.91 ± 19 g m-2 day-1), while the presence of gelatin lowered it. The hydrogels were preliminary exposed to human fibroblasts (MRC-5 cell line) and then to Caenorhabditis elegans to reveal the effects on whole living organisms.

      "abstract": "Diabetes, characterized by hyperglycemia, poses a significant threat to human health. Diabetic wounds exhibit heightened levels of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), bacterial infection, hypoxia, and substantial exudate. These factors accelerate the inflammatory phase and impede wound healing, often leading to chronicity. Inadequate wound healing is a common chronic complication of diabetes. In this study, we fabricated three-dimensional (3D) curcumin@(manganese dioxide (MnO2)@(gelatin/polylactic acid (PLA)@ε-polylysine (ε-pl))) (GPPMC) nanofibrous scaffolds dressing using coaxial electrospinning, homogenization, freeze-drying, glutaraldehyde crosslinking, and impregnation techniques. The presented gelatin-based 3D nanofibrous dressing demonstrated superior water absorption capacity, hemostatic proficiency, enhanced cell adhesion and tissue infiltration compared to two-dimensional (2D) counterparts. It also exhibited exceptional compressibility, biocompatibility, prolonged curcumin and ε-pl drug release, as well as scavenging capabilities against ROS, antibacterial efficacy and oxygen generation in vitro. Additionally, this dressing exhibited remarkable wound healing efficacy and anti-inflammatory in vivo. These findings suggested that the developed multifunctional gelatin-based 3D nanofibrous scaffold is a promising candidate for the treatment of diabetic wounds."

      "abstract": "Following a holistic sustainable approach, we fabricated a biocomposite from pine needles (PNs), with two biopolymers, chitosan (CS) and gelatin (GEL). The biocomposite was used as an effective, regenerable, and reusable adsorbent for the removal of cationic and anionic dyes from their mixture. The cationic dyes chosen were malachite green, methylene blue, and crystal violet; and the anionic dyes were methyl orange and Congo red. The PNs were etherified followed by composite formation with glutaraldehyde-mediated crosslinked network of CS/GEL. Synthesis of composite, i.e. etherified PNs/CS/GEL was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, and surface charge analysis. The adsorption kinetics studied by different kinetic models, such as pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and Elovich, followed the Elovich model. Among the three adsorption isotherms (Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin) studied, the adsorption followed Langmuir isotherm with maximum adsorption capacity of 307.871 mgg-1 for the mixture of dyes. The reusability studies affirmed the ease of regeneration of the hydrogel for use in multiple cycles. The reported adsorbent is green, low-cost, eco-friendly, and recyclable with a high potential to remove cationic and anionic dyes from their mixture and the real dye-contaminated wastewater."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) is the material of choice for pulp therapy. However, Ca(OH) 2 has drawbacks such as toxicity, poor sealing, and tunnel defect formation. Alternative materials have been developed to provide more biocompatible materials with better dentin formation ability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of composites containing gelatin (G), chitosan (CH), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and Ca(OH) 2, namely G-CH-TEOS-Ca (OH) 2 (Extended data) on inflammation of the dental pulp (expression of COX-2, PGP 9.5, TNF-α, and neutrophil number). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 16 Wistar rat models of acute pulp injury were prepared and divided into two groups, treatment and control, 8 with each. In the treatment group, we applied a pulp-capping material using G-CH-TEOS-Ca (OH) 2 and Ca(OH) 2. On the 1 st and 3 rd days, rats were sacrificed. Tissue samples from 4 rats in each group were processed for histological preparation. COX-2, PGP 9.5, and TNF-α were observed using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and neutrophil numbers were observed using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Image analysis of COX-2, PGP 9.5, and TNF-α expression was performed using ImageJ software. RESULTS: The results showed a decrease in COX-2 expression, but not significantly while PGP 9.5 and TNF-α expression were significantly higher than those in the control group. Neutrophil numbers were lower in the treatment group than in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The G-CH-TEOS-Ca (OH) 2 composite material may have potential as an exposed pulp medicament by reducing inflammation (COX-2 expression and number of neutrophils) and increasing the regeneration factor (TNF-α expression) and nerve (PGP 9.5 expression).",

      "abstract": "The treatment of degenerative pathologies affecting articular cartilage remains a significant clinical challenge. Non-invasive biophysical stimuli, such as electric fields, have demonstrated potential as therapeutic tools for cartilage tissue restoration. Previous studies have reported that electric fields enhance chondrocyte proliferation and the synthesis of key extracellular matrix components, such as glycosaminoglycans. However, inconsistencies in experimental designs have led to variable findings. This study examines the effects of capacitively coupled electric fields on chondrocytes cultured in gelatin hydrogels. Alternating voltages of 50 V (7.7 mV/cm) and 100 V (8.7 mV/cm) at a frequency of 60 kHz were applied for 21 days. Cell quantification and glycosaminoglycan analysis were performed on both stimulated and control samples. On day 7, exposure to the electric field resulted in a significant reduction in cell proliferation by 24.7% and 39.2% at 7.7 mV/cm and 8.7 mV/cm, respectively (p < 0.05). However, stimulation at 8.7 mV/cm led to a 35.7% increase in glycosaminoglycan synthesis compared to the control group (p < 0.05). These findings indicate that electric field stimulation can modulate the synthesis of essential extracellular matrix components, such as glycosaminoglycans, in hyaline cartilage. This highlights the potential of electric fields as a promising strategy to enhance outcomes in articular cartilage tissue engineering, particularly in hydrogel-based therapeutic approaches."

This study presents a novel methylene blue-based photoactive hydrogel designed as a topical gel solution to overcome the limitations of traditional pad-based systems by offering enhanced adaptability to irregular wound surfaces, uniform photosensitizer distribution, and deeper therapeutic light penetration. This study investigated the development of hydrogels by cross-linking gelatin with glutaraldehyde (GA) and incorporating methylene blue (MB) to investigate the effects of cross-linking density, network structure, and small molecule inclusion on hydrogel properties. The results showed that while glutaraldehyde concentration influenced swelling behavior and network structure, the inclusion of MB altered these properties, particularly reducing swelling and MB retention at higher GA concentrations. Rheological and thermal analyses confirmed that higher GA concentrations made the hydrogels more rigid, with MB influencing both mechanical and thermal properties. Additionally, the hydrogels exhibited enhanced antimicrobial properties through increased reactive oxygen species production, particularly in light-activated conditions, demonstrating the potential of MB-based photoactive hydrogels for improving antimicrobial efficacy, especially against S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans, offering as a possible alternative to traditional antimicrobial treatments."

      "abstract": "Gastric wound healing constitutes a complex challenge, even in the context of superficial wounds, due to the harsh stomach environment, characterized by high pH variability and dynamic enzyme concentrations. Therefore, effective healing depends on robust mechanical support and adequate biochemical cues to drive cell growth and proliferation. Electrospun-based dressings may offer a solution to these problems by providing physical support that mimics native extracellular matrix. In this study, electrospun dressings composed of a blend of polycaprolactone (PCL) and gelatin (Gel) were proposed for the first time for gastric application by tuning the relative PCL:Gel ratios (75:25, 50:50 and 25:75) to optimize both their retention capacity and cellular interaction. PCL/Gel dressings, in a proportion of 75:25, showed to have efficient mucoadhesion (ultimate stress of 1.8 MPa) when tested in ex vivo porcine samples. They were also stable in simulated gastric fluid for 14 days, a period compatible with the treatment window. Moreover, the non-cytotoxic biological response (>90 %) of the dressings was favorably validated in mouse fibroblast L929 cell line. Cell morphology, metabolic activity, cell viability and proliferative capacity were assessed using human specific gastric cell lines, including normal stomach fibroblasts (NST-20) and gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS). Overall, PCL/Gel dressings of 75:25 increased the proliferation rate of NST20 and AGS cells after 3 and 7 days in culture, respectively, with significant expression of proliferation marker Ki-67 protein.",

      "abstract": "Bacterial nanocellulose (BnC) is of immense importance in medicine, although its lack of bioactivity present intriguing issue. We propose a method to modify BnC with gelatin and nisin biomolecules, and explore their synergistic effect on the antimicrobial activity. Gelatin microparticles (without/with nisin loading) with a size ~0.5 μm and ~ 1.3 μm were prepared by spray drying and stabilised by dehydrothermal treatment. Modified BnC-based membranes supported the formation of biologically relevant minerals and were non-cytotoxic to human gingival fibroblast cells (HGF). The presence of gelatin microparticles improved the viability of HGF by approximately 20 %, due to the effect of gelatin alone, independent of the addition of nisin. BnC coated with a nisin/gelatin solution reduces the viability of HGF by about 20 %, but this negative effect is not observed by nisin coated gelatin microparticles. The cell viability of BnC membranes was above 90 % in both porcine and human urothelial cells. The antimicrobial activity study confirmed an inhibitory effect of membranes modified with nisin-coated microparticles or a gelatin/nisin solution against Staphylococcus aureus at a non-cytotoxic nisin dose (150 μg/mL). The study demonstrates the structural effects of gelatin and gelatin/nisin mixtures on the bioactivity of BnC and provides a rationale for the modification procedure.",

Therefore, we developed freeze-dried scaffolds based on the in situ synthesis of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HAp NPs) within a gelatin-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-alginate matrix using a co-precipitation method. Ceftazidime and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were used as drug models and were separately loaded into the fabricated scaffolds. The hybrid scaffolds exhibited an ultimate compressive strength of 1.1 MPa and flexible behavior favored for fitting irregular bone defects. 5-FU-loaded scaffolds showed higher bioactive potential within 3 days compared to ceftazidime-loaded scaffolds. The scaffolds exhibited a long-term degradation rate, and thereby prolonged release of ceftazidim and 5-FU for up to 28 days. 5-FU-loaded scaffolds showed excellent nearly equal antibacterial activity to ceftazidime-loaded scaffolds against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli strains. Osteosarcoma cell death was achieved by increased concentrations of ceftazidime and 5-FU treatment above 300 μg/mL and 250 μg/mL, respectively. The developed scaffolds displayed higher bone formation ability with better osteogenesis in a femoral rat bone defect model compared to the control sample. This work represents a promising solution for bone defect repair and provides insight into the development of multifunctional scaffolds for local chemotherapy and bone tissue engineering applications."

Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the interaction between the nanoemulsion and the matrix, resulting in altered absorption peaks. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the addition of LCEO-NE increased the surface roughness, crystallinity, and thermal stability of the films. Furthermore, incorporating LCEO-NE significantly enhanced the physical properties and bioactivity of the films, with CGL-3 exhibiting optimal performance: tensile strength of 2.31 MPa, elongation at break of 72.31 %, strong antibacterial and antioxidant effects, excellent water absorption, biocompatibility, prolonged essential oil release (66 h), a water vapor permeability of 40.73 g/m2/h, and a contact angle of 82.23°. In vivo testing in a mouse model showed a 99 % wound healing rate by day 15 following treatment with the CGL-3 film, along with enhanced collagen deposition, accelerated epithelialization, and reduced inflammation.

Ultrasonic treatment ensured effective homogenization of SBO in both types of emulsions, resulting in yellow-tinted semi-opaque films with relatively low micro-roughness. Generally, GEL films demonstrated lower UV barrier properties and solubility but exhibited higher compactness, crystallinity, transparency, surface hydrophobicity, oxygen barrier performance, strength, and antiradical activity compared to their NaCAS-based counterparts. In a concentration-dependent manner, SBO decreased the solubility and water absorption of the gelatin-based film and enhanced its oxygen permeability. Conversely, SBO improved the water vapor barrier properties of both films in a concentration-independent manner. At the highest SBO concentration, the tensile strength of NaCAS- and GEL-based films decreased by 27% and 20%, respectively, while their antiradical activity increased by 9.3× and 4.3× (based on the time required for the half-neutralization of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals). Migration studies showed that at the lowest concentration, SBO was released (into 95% ethanol) approximately 2× faster from the GEL-based film than from the NaCAS film, whereas at higher concentrations, the trend reversed."

In this study, chitosan/gelatin/supersaturated calcium citrate scaffolds were prepared with the dehydrogenation heat treatment method. The results confirmed that citric acid significantly improved the cross-linking degree and efficiency of the chitosan/gelatin scaffolds. But the addition of Ca2+ reduced the cross-linking degree, water absorption, and resistance to enzymatic degradation of the scaffolds. While, the supersaturated calcium citrate formed inside the scaffold increased its mechanical strength. The biocompatibility and osteogenic activity of scaffolds were measured by inoculation with MC3T3-E1 cells. The rapid and efficient release of Ca2+ from the scaffolds could significantly promote cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation, while cell activities were inhibited by excessive Ca2+. The results of repairing skull defects in SD rats demonstrated that the chitosan/gelatin/supersaturated calcium citrate scaffolds with 25 mM Ca2+ added had a stronger osteogenic effect compared to the chitosan/gelatin scaffolds. Hence, the chitosan/gelatin/ supersaturated calcium citrate scaffolds prepared in this study are promising materials for treating bone defects. The appropriate amount of calcium salt added to the scaffold in order to optimize its biocompatibility and osteogenic activity deserves further investigation.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic osteoarthritis remains a significant clinical challenge, with limited effective treatment options. Conventional hydrogels for articular cartilage repair primarily focus on the bioactivity of the materials but often overlook the importance of monitoring the hydrogel's behavior in situ. This study presents the development of a novel injectable, traceable fluorescent hydrogel designed to prevent cartilage degradation and promote cartilage regeneration. The hydrogel was synthesized by forming a dynamically crosslinked network of oxidized hyaluronic acid (OHA) and adipic dihydrazide-grafted HA (HA-ADH), followed by photo-crosslinking with methacrylated gelatin (GelMA). Furthermore, GelMA was covalently conjugated with Rhodamine B, enabling real-time tracking of hydrogel degradation in situ. Experimental results demonstrated that the fluorescence of the hydrogel could effectively penetrate both skin and cartilage tissues, allowing for real-time monitoring. Additionally, the hydrogel exhibited superior lubrication (with a coefficient of friction of 0.134, comparable to HA) and favorable rheological properties, along with excellent biocompatibility. It also promoted cell differentiation and migration. In vivo studies showed that the hydrogel facilitated cartilage repair and prevented cartilage degradation over a 56-day period. Given its mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and fluorescence-based monitoring capability, this hydrogel shows great promise for real-time tracking in cartilage repair for the treatment of post-traumatic osteoarthritis.",

      "abstract": "The controllable fabrication and performances of monodisperse genipin-cross-linked gelatin-chitosan composite (GGC) embolic microspheres with both uniform sizes and adjustable characteristics of elasticity and degradation are reported for the first time. Monodisperse emulsion droplets are fabricated as templates by using gelatin and chitosan aqueous solution as the disperse phase in a microfluidic device, and the chemical cross-linking of gelatin and chitosan inside droplet templates is achieved with genipin that transfers from the collection bath into the droplets. The sizes of droplet templates and the resultant GGC microspheres can be flexibly controlled and predicted by adjusting the fluid flow rates and the device dimensions. The elastic property of GGC microspheres can be flexibly regulated by adjusting the molar ratio of gelatin/chitosan in the disperse phase. The in vitro degradation-caused dynamic volume shrinkage of GGC microspheres can be flexibly regulated by adjusting the molar ratio of gelatin/chitosan, the chitosan deacetylation degree, and the enzyme concentration in degradation solution. Based on the Box-Behnken design-response surface method, a second-order equation is developed for the first time to predict the in vitro degradation-caused dynamic volume shrinkage ratios of microspheres prepared with different molar ratios of gelatin/chitosan and different chitosan deacetylation degrees in degradation solutions with different enzyme concentrations. The fabricated GGC microspheres show good repeatable embolization performances in an in vitro embolization chip system. The results of this study provide valuable guidance for controllable fabrication of degradable microspheres with both uniform sizes and on-demand elastic and degradation characteristics for efficient application in embolization therapy."

However, the high recurrence and metastasis rate of osteosarcoma and bone defects caused by surgery are still the main problems faced by osteosarcoma. Gelatin has excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, and has made phased progress in tumor treatment. In the treatment of osteosarcoma, gelatin-based biomaterials can be used in delivery strategies to enhance the anti-tumor activity of osteosarcoma and can improve the appropriate compressive strength to improve the bone defects faced after surgery. At present, gelatin-based hydrogels, gelatin scaffolds, and gelatin-based nanoparticles have been reported in preclinical studies. In this article, we introduce the application of gelatin-based biomaterials in the treatment of osteosarcoma, and summarize and look forward to them."

This study investigates the effectiveness of gelatin-epigallocatechin gallate nanoparticles with hyaluronic acid coating (GEH NPs) and various artificial tears in treating KCS led keratopathy in a rat model. Eighteen female Sprague-Dawley rats, aged 6 to 8 weeks were randomly assigned to 6 groups of 3. All rats except the Sham group underwent unilateral exorbital and infraorbital lacrimal gland excisions to induce KCS. The treatment groups included a KCS group without treatment, a GEH group treated with GEH NPs, and 3 groups receiving different artificial tears. Clinical examinations, including slit-lamp biomicroscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and ocular surface analyser-VET (OSA-VET) were conducted preoperatively at 1 and 2 weeks postoperatively. For treating KCS associated keratopathy, the GEH NPs showed superior outcomes and consistently ranked among the strongest treatment options in most aspects evaluated, including reduced corneal irregularity, improved tear film stability, and lower fluorescein scores, indicating better corneal integrity. Additionally, the GEH group displayed the least inflammatory cell infiltration and maintained a healthier epithelial structure, further underscoring its protective effects. GEH was administered twice daily while other treatment groups were administrated 3 times daily, highlighting its efficacy even with a lower dosing frequency. The artificial tears demonstrated variable benefits on KCS led keratopathy across different evaluations. GEH NPs exhibited excellent protective effects and therapeutic potential on dry eye associated keratopathy based on this study.",

Polymeric scaffolds represent a promising therapeutic strategy to preserve cell mass through 3D cultures. The aim of this study is to explore an alternative polymeric scaffold based on a mix of chitosan (Chi), gelatin (Ge), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) functionalized with VEGF for the culture of insulin-producing cells. The scaffolds were obtained by freeze-thaw cycles and lyophilization, followed by neutralization and, functionalization with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Physicochemical characteristics, biocompatibility and functionality were evaluated. Scaffolds obtained had interconnected heterogeneous pores. The presence of functional groups confirmed the integration of all the components without significantly losing thermal stability and mass. The functionalized and neutralized scaffolds positively impacted the biocompatibility and insulin secretion. Cell respiration was sustained, and cell morphology demonstrated the formation of cell clusters. It can be concluded that neutralization and functionalization of the scaffolds combined with VEGF are necessary to improve biocompatibility and functionality. Moreover, all these characteristics generated encouraging results on the diffusion of nutrients and cell adhesion, which could be valuable in the translational application for diabetes treatment.",

Specifically, the concurrent treatment with SF and 6-OHDA produced a marked neuroprotective effect. Circular dichroism analysis suggested the formation of silk III because of the interaction between the secondary structures of SF and 6-OHDA. Raman analysis was also employed to assess the impact of SF and CaCl2 on cellular metabolism, indicating the combined administration of fibroin and 6-OHDA as more effective than the use of CaCl2 alone.

However, there are some obvious obstacles that need to be overcome in the efficient expansion of Muse cells. We extracted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from human umbilical cord and their MSCs phenotypes were verified by flow cytometry. Then, immune magnetic sorting was performed to obtain Muse cells, and the expression of pluripotency related factors and the ability to differentiate into three germ layers were verified with sorted Muse cells. We then tested a new 3D culture method with dynamic microsphere carrier to possibly expand Muse cells more efficiently. Finally, in vivo experiments were conducted to check the homing ability of Muse cells to muscle injury. Our results showed that, the cultivation and expansion of Muse cells can be more effectively achieved through dynamic microsphere carrier; compared to non-Muse cells, Muse cells have stronger pluripotency and differentiation ability, and their homing ability in the muscle injury mice model is superior to that of non-Muse cells. Therefore, with the method of immune magnetic sorting and dynamic microsphere carrier, highly regenerative Muse cells can be more effectively sorted and expanded from MSCs."

Effective nonsurgical management of this disease necessitates advanced technologies that counter bacterial presence and stimulate bone repair. The purpose of this study is to create a multifunctional composite hydrogel by combining gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) with surface-imprinted chitosan-modified bioglass (MIP) particles for the controlled release of doxycycline (DOX). Findings indicate that incorporating MIP particles plays a key role in modulating the swelling ratio, degradability, wettability, rheological behavior, and mechanical performances of composite hydrogels. Additionally, these injectable hydrogels are bioactive, promoting in vitro formation of bone-like apatite while providing rapid in vitro localized hemostasis, along with antioxidant and antibacterial effects against both Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria, depending on MIP particle concentration. Notably, the MIP particles could improve cellular responses, supporting better spreading and osteogenic differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) in both basic and osteogenic media, driven by optimal bioglass ion release and DOX. Overall, these injectable composite hydrogels show promising features as a nonsurgical therapeutic strategy for periodontal disease.",

      "abstract": "Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory condition mainly caused by the interaction between the host immune system and periodontal tissue pathogens, and may lead to consequences, such as alveolar bone defects and tooth loss. Incomplete bacterial removal, persistent inflammation and high reactive oxygen species (ROS) environment are the main challenges for periodontal tissue repair and alveolar bone regeneration. In this study, an injectable composite microgel (Gelatin methacryloyl-Phenylboronic acid/Hydroxyadamantane, GPH) loaded with antimicrobial peptide (AMP) and cerium dioxide (CeO2) microspheres was developed to achieve a synergistic function of bacteriostasis, immunomodulation, and ROS removal. In vitro studies had shown that the composite microgel had an inhibitory rate of >99 % against E. coli, S. aureus and P. gingivalis and scavenged DPPH with a rate of 87.1 % ± 2.0 %, exhibiting excellent antibacterial and antioxidant properties. In addition, it was able to promote macrophage phenotypic shift from M1-type to M2-type and reduce ROS levels, and also had excellent biocompatibility. Mechanistically, the composite microgel was subjected to transcriptome sequencing analysis of gene expression levels and signaling pathways in BMSC cells, and the results showed that the microgel played an important role in regulating the PI3K-Akt and chemokine signaling pathways, which in turn inhibited the expression of inflammatory factors. In vivo the effect of composite microgel on periodontal tissue repair and alveolar bone regeneration was verified by infected alveolar bone defect model. The results showed that after 4 weeks of using the composite microgel, the bone volume per unit of tissue volume of the alveolar bone, the thickness of bone trabeculae, and the bone mineral density reached 25.94 % ± 0.03 %, 0.14 mm ± 0.01 mm, and 0.442 g/cm3 ± 0.003 g/cm3, respectively, while those of the control group were 22.3 % ± 0.29 %, 0.07 mm ± 0.02 mm, and 0.236 g/cm3 ± 0.059 g/cm3, respectively, and the use of the composite microgel resulted in significantly better repair results than the control group. In addition, pro-inflammatory factors were significantly suppressed and inflammation levels were significantly reduced. Overall, this composite microgel showed great potential in reducing inflammation levels and promoting alveolar bone regeneration, providing an innovative approach to the treatment of periodontitis.",

      "abstract": "Hernia is characterized by the protrusion of organs or tissue through weakened areas in the abdominal cavity wall. A common treatment for hernia involves the implantation of a mesh which promotes the growth of new tissue around or within the implanted material in the damaged area. The mesh is typically made from synthetic materials like polypropylene. However, such meshes have safety concerns like biofilm and scar tissue formation, foreign body reactions, and chronic pain. These concerns gave rise to the development of biological meshes. Owing to mechanical weakness, biological meshes fail due to migration and rapid degradation. This study is aimed to develop a mechanically viable biopolymer-based composite degradable mesh. A gelatin-MWCNT composite 3D printed mesh has been developed with different pore sizes and filament sizes. Adding MWCNTs improved the composite's ductility, printability, hydrophilicity, and modulus, and reduced its degradation rate. The 3D-printed mesh also showed signs of cell attachment and proliferation representing non-toxicity of MWCNTs within the composite materials. The data showed improved cell adherence due to the incorporation of MWCNTs within the composite materials. Among the various material compositions tested, the composite material with gelatin with 0.01 g MWCNTs gave the optimum mechanical strength and biocompatibility results.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is a lethal malignancy that begins from acquired/inherent premalignant lesions. Thus, targeting these lesions at an early stage of the disease could impede the oncogenesis and maximize the efficacy. The present work underscores a combinatorial therapy of paclitaxel (PTX) and glycyrrhizin (GL) delivered via gelatin-derived core-shell nanoparticles [AC-PCL(GL + PTX)-GNPs] for effective management of precancerous lesions. The desolvation method was adopted to prepare GL-loaded gelatin nanoparticles (GL-GNPs), which were coated with PTX and AC-PCL. The prepared NPs exhibited optimal physical attributes and had spherical morphology, as analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. In vitro release studies revealed sustained release for ∼96 h. Cell culture studies in HTC 116, and HT-29 cells showed synergistic action with CI < 0.9 and DRI > 1. Moreover, AC-PCL(GL + PTX)-GNPs exhibited amplified intracellular uptake and thus significantly reduced IC50. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed substantiated pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC0-∞, Cmax, etc.). In vivo studies in a 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine-induced model revealed a decrease in the number of lesions, mucin depletion, and subside infiltrations. An immunohistochemical study revealed elevated expression of caspase-9 and suppressed expression of VEGF and Ki-67. Toxicity studies showed insignificant changes in systemic biomarkers along with no alterations in organ morphology and hemocompatibility. In essence, AC-PCL(GL + PTX)-GNPs render a competent and safer tactic to regulate early-stage precancerous lesions.",

      "abstract": "The treatment of diabetic wounds with bacterial infection is a major challenge in the medical field. Microenvironment-responsive hydrogel dressings have shown great advantages, and photothermal antibacterial therapy is a potential antimicrobial strategy to avoid the generation of resistant bacteria. In this work, a glucose-triggered near-infrared (NIR)-responsive photothermal antibacterial hydrogel was designed and named GOGD based on a cascade reaction of glucose oxidation and polyphenol polymerization. The GOGD hydrogel was composed of gelatin and oxidized dextran (Odex), and loaded with a natural plant polyphenol gallic acid (GA) and the dual-biological enzymes (glucose oxidase GOx and horseradish peroxidase HRP). In response to the high glucose environment, GOx in the hydrogel decomposed glucose to produce hydrogen peroxide, which further catalyzed GA polymerization with HRP to produce poly-GA possessing NIR photothermal capability, thus endow GOGD hydrogel with glucose-triggered NIR responsive photothermal antibacterial property simultaneously targeting the high glucose and infection microenvironment in diabetic wounds. Furthermore, the GOGD hydrogel demonstrated good biocompatibility and a strong ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby protecting cells from oxidative damage. In a mouse model, this hydrogel not only displayed excellent hemostatic properties but also significantly enhanced the healing of Staphylococcus aureus-infected diabetic wounds by regulating inflammation and promoting angiogenesis. Therefore, the proposed GOGD hydrogel provides a novel approach to diabetic wound treatment by utilizing its unique glucose-responsive mechanism combined with integrated NIR-photothermal bacterial inhibition. This well-designed material holds great promise for significantly improving the healing of infected diabetic wounds and offers new prospects for future advancements in wound therapy.",

      "abstract": "The development of resistance to traditional antifungal therapies has necessitated the exploration of alternative treatment strategies to effectively manage fungal infections, particularly those induced by Candida albicans (C. albicans). This research investigates the possibility of integrating silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with Terbinafine to improve antifungal effectiveness. Terbinafine, while potent, faces challenges with specific fungal strains, highlighting the need for strategies to enhance its treatment efficacy. Silver nanoparticles were produced through a light-activated, gelatin-based method, resulting in particle sizes ranging from 56.8 nm to 66.2 nm, confirmed by dynamic light scattering and scanning electron microscopy. Stability studies indicated that AgNPs produced with 30 mg of silver nitrate (AgNO₃) exhibited the greatest stability over 60 days across different temperature conditions. The analysis through UV-visible spectrophotometry revealed a notable shift in the absorption spectra as AgNO₃ concentrations increased, which was associated with a strengthening of plasmon resonance. The effectiveness of the AgNPs and Terbinafine combination was assessed against three strains of C. albicans (ATCC 10231, ATCC 90028, and ATCC 18804). Terbinafine demonstrated strong antifungal properties with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values ranging from 2-4 µg/mL, whereas AgNPs on their own displayed moderate effectiveness. The integrated formulation notably enhanced effectiveness, especially against strain ATCC 90028, revealing a synergistic effect (FIFi = 0.369). These results were complemented by the findings of the time-to-kill assay, where the same strain showed a 3.2 log₁₀ CFU/mL decrease in viable cell count. The process by which AgNPs boost activity entails the disruption of the fungal cell membrane and its internal components, probably as a result of silver ion release and the generation of free radicals. The results indicate that the combination of Terbinafine and AgNPs may act as a powerful alternative for addressing resistant fungal infections, presenting an encouraging direction for future antifungal treatments."

Methods: The scaffolds were engineered as interpenetrating polymeric networks by the crosslinking reaction of gelatin in the presence of alginate and characterized by structural, morphological, mechanical, swelling properties, porosity, adhesion to the skin tissue, wettability, and in vitro simultaneous release of the active agents. Biocompatibility of the scaffolds were evaluated in vitro by MTT test on fibroblasts (MRC5 cells) and in vivo using Caenorhabditis elegans assay. Results: The scaffolds exhibited a highly porous interconnected morphology with adjustable porosity (93-96%) and mechanical strength (1.10-2.90 MPa), hydrophilic nature with high capacity to absorb physiological fluids, and stable adhesion to the skin tissue. The obtained results of MRC5 cell viability indicate that the scaffolds are safe for biomedical applications. No mortality was detected among the Caenorhabditis elegans throughout the incubation period, indicating that the scaffolds are not toxic. The results of in vitro release study of allantoin, quercetin, and caffeic acid confirm the scaffolds' significant potential for simultaneous release. Conclusion: The graphene oxide/gelatin/alginate scaffolds are promising candidates for non-invasive, dual ECM-mimetic, and multi-target wound therapy, offering an innovative strategy to address the complexities of wound healing process."

Methods: An RvD1 complexed with GelMA was prepared, and its release kinetics and compatibility with PDLCs were assessed. Rats with induced periodontitis were treated weekly with topical applications of vehicle, GelMA, RvD1, or RvD1 complexed with GelMA for four weeks. Periodontal inflammation and tissue regeneration were evaluated using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and histochemical staining, while alveolar bone repair and regeneration were analyzed through micro-CT. Results: The RvD1 complexed with GelMA effectively released RvD1 and enhanced the proliferation and viability of PDLCs. Compared to RvD1 alone, treatment with RvD1 complexed with GelMA significantly reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, TNF-α and RANKL expression, and osteoclast formation in periodontal tissues. Additionally, it promoted the expression of specific anti-inflammatory and regenerative markers. Micro-CT analysis confirmed significant new bone formation in the RvD1 complexed with GelMA-treated group. Conclusions: RvD1 complexed with GelMA provides sustained drug release and biocompatibility, effectively resolves periodontal inflammation, and promotes tissue regeneration in periodontitis."

      "abstract": "The skin serves as a critical barrier against external pathogens, and its wound healing is a complex biological process that requires careful management to ensure optimal tissue regeneration. Hydrogels, a class of hydrophilic polymers, have emerged as promising materials for wound dressings due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ability to create a moist wound environment conducive to cell proliferation and migration. In this research, a hydrogel dressing containing cefdinir (Cef) was made from a combination of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and gelatin (Gel) by a physical crosslinking method, and their physicochemical, mechanical, and biological properties were investigated. Results show that the addition of Cef does not cause a significant change in the morphology or the tensile strength of the wound dressing. The swelling and degradation rate of the hydrogel slightly increased in the presence of Cef. The presence of Cef enhanced antibacterial effects up to 2.5-fold against P. aeruginosa (35 mm), S. aureus (36 mm), and S. pyogenes (35 mm). The results of the cytotoxicity test showed the absence of cytotoxicity in both drug-containing and drug-free wound dressings, as well as a survival rate of over 75% in cells after 48 h. The drug-containing wound dressing accelerates the formation of the epidermis layer and the production of fibroblast cells, and as a result, accelerates the wound healing process. The percentage of wound healing on the ninth day of treatment for an untreated wound was 30%, while this percentage was 40% with a wound dressing without medicine and 60% with a wound dressing containing medicine, and on the fifteenth day of treatment, the wound treated with both wound dressings had more than 85% healing. As a result, it is possible to use CMC/Gel hydrogel polymeric wound dressing containing Cef as a wound dressing for wound healing, according to the desired physicochemical properties and biocompatibility."

This work aims to exploit 3D printing to develop natural biogels composed of fish gelatin and high acyl gellan gum for use as flexible sensors. The electrical conductivity and mechanical strength were remarkably enhanced through the environmentally friendly enzyme (transglutaminase) cross-linking and non-toxic ethanol modification treatment, which allows the development of 3D printed sensors for temperature, strain, and stress sensors. The hydrogel exhibits excellent mechanical and electrical properties as strain sensors, with Young's modulus and tensile strength of 20.7 ± 1.38 kPa and 0.14 ± 0.01 MPa, respectively, and an ultimate strain of 270.54 ± 16.23 %, which is conducive to a comfortable wearing experience. Moreover, the obtained sensors exhibited ultra-low latency (6.1 ± 1.47 ms), good durability (withstanding 1000 cyclic stretching) and high monitor sensitivity (GF = 2.37 ± 0.14) to human body movements; furthermore, the biogel fabricated using this method exhibits complete biodegradation within approximately 20 days, offering innovative prospects for the advancement of eco-friendly materials.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Given the risks associated with autologous bone transplantation and the limitations of allogeneic bone transplantation, scaffolds in bone tissue engineering that incorporate bioactive peptides are highly recommended. Teriparatide (TPTD) plays a significant role in bone defect repair, although achieving controlled release of TPTD within a bone tissue engineering scaffold remains challenging. This work reports a new approach for treatment of teriparatide using a water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) microspheres be equipped on gelatin (GEL)/Poly lactic-glycolic acid (PLGA)/attapulgite (ATP) scaffold. METHODS: In this study, TPTD microspheres were prepared by the water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) double emulsion technique and GEL/PLGA/ATP composite scaffolds with different setups were prepared by salt leaching method. Both microspheres and scaffolds underwent physicochemical characterization. Mouse bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were co-cultured with extracts from the microspheres and scaffolds to evaluate cell proliferation and osteogenesis. Four weeks post-implantation, the effectiveness of the scaffolds containing microspheres for repairing skull defects in mice was assessed. RESULTS: Both TPTD microspheres and the GEL/PLGA/ATP scaffold significantly enhanced the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Markers of osteoblast activity, including COL1, RUNX2, OCN, and OPN, were markedly up-regulated. Further, micro-CT, histological, and immunohistochemical analyses revealed extensive new bone formation on the scaffold. CONCLUSION: The GEL/PLGA/ATP composite scaffold, equipped with TPTD microspheres, demonstrates significant potential for use in bone tissue engineering, providing an effective option for bone regeneration and repair in clinical applications.",

This study aimed to develop patient-friendly in situ gelling nanofibers composed of oxidized carboxymethyl cellulose (OCMC) and gelatin for wound healing applications. A two-axial electrospinning technique was employed to fabricate OCMC/PVA-Gelatin hybrid nanofibers. Because of the nanofibers' high surface area, the resulting scaffold can quickly absorb wound exudates, resulting in a cross-linked hydrogel via the Schiff-base reaction between OCMC and gelatin. The nanofibers were thoroughly characterized using SEM, FTIR, XRD, and TGA, confirming their successful fabrication and structural integrity. Notably, the nanofibers demonstrated full degradation within 21 days, aligning with the requirements for skin tissue regeneration. Antibacterial assays revealed 99.9 % efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The electrospun OCMC/PVA and OCMC/PVA-Gel samples exhibited 91 ± 10 % and 92 ± 7 % cell viability after 7 days of L929 fibroblast cell culture, confirming their excellent biocompatibility. These findings highlight the potential of the developed nanofibers as antimicrobial and biocompatible wound dressings with an appropriate degradation profile, presenting a practical and effective alternative to conventional hydrogel systems for advanced wound healing applications.",

This innovative study synthesizes and characterizes Ge/PLA/AuNCs (gelatin/PLA/gold nanocomposites) using Syzygium cumini extract to evaluate their various biomedical applications. The UV-Visible spectroscopy results in an absorption peak at 534 nm were primarily confirmed by Ge/PLA/AuNCs synthesis. The FTIR spectrum showed various functional groups and the XRD patterns confirmed the crystalline shape and structure of nanocomposites. The FESEM and HRTEM results showed a oval shape of Ge/PLA/AuNCs with an average particle size of 21 nm. The Ge/PLA/AuNC's remarkable antioxidant activity, as evidenced by DPPH (70.84 ± 1.64%), ABTS activity (86.17 ± 1.96%), and reducing power activity (78.42 ± 1.48%) at a concentration of 100 μg/mL was observed. The zone of inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus (19.45 ± 0.89 mm) and Echericia coli (20.83 ± 0.97 mm) revealed the excellent antibacterial activity of Ge/PLA/AuNCs. The anti-diabetic activity of Ge/PLA/AuNCs was supported by inhibition of α-amylase (82.56 ± 1.49%) and α-glucosidase (80.27 ± 1.57%). The anti-Alzheimer activity was confirmed by inhibition of the AChE (76.37 ± 1.18%) and BChE (85.94 ± 1.38%) enzymes. In vivo studies of zebrafish embryos showed that Ge/PLA/AuNCs have excellent biocompatibility and nontoxicity. The SH-SY5Y cell line study demonstrated improved cell viability (95.27 ± 1.62%) and enhanced neuronal cell growth following Ge/PLA/AuNCs treatment. In conclusion, the present study highlights the cost-effective and non-toxic properties of Ge/PLA/AuNCs.

      "abstract": "The bacterial infection and oxidative wound microenvironment delay skin repair and necessitate intelligent wound dressings to enable scarless wound healing. The immunoglobulin of yolk (IgY) exhibits immunotherapeutic potential for the potential treatment of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, while cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs) could scavenge superoxide dismutase (SOD) and inflammation. The overarching objective of this study was to incorporate IgY and CeO2 NPs into poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide)/gelatin (PLGA/Gel)-based dressings (P/G@IYCe) for infected skin repair. The P/G@IYCe manifested good biocompatibility as well as showed significant antibacterial effect against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E.coil) in vitro. Subcutaneous implantation of membranes in rats exhibited cytocompatibility. Transplantation of membranes in S. aureus-infected full-thickness excisional defects manifested significant beneficial effect of P/G@IYCe dressings than that of the other groups in terms of the scar tissue formation, inflammation resolution, and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at 2 weeks post-transplantation. Taken together, the dual delivery of IgY and CeO2 may enable intelligent wound dressings."

      "abstract": "The healing of wounds in aging skin is a challenging issue that has not been thoroughly studied. Composite hydrogels made from natural polysaccharides have shown potential as dressings for various types of wounds. In this study, we prepared a polysaccharide-based composite hydrogel to provide a new strategy for treating aging skin wounds. First, chitosan (CS) was modified and Gastrodin (GAS) was grafted onto its main chain structure to obtain GAS/CS. Then GAS/CS was mixed with oxidized Gastrodia elata polysaccharides (GEP) to form a hydrogel using the principle of adsorbent reaction, and Puerarin (PUE), a natural plant ingredient, was embedded by gelatin microspheres and then loaded into the hydrogel. As a result, the composite hydrogel effectively reduced oxidative stress in tissue cells at the wound site and inhibited bacterial growth. It also reduced inflammation, promoted angiogenesis, and enhanced collagen deposition, which facilitated the repair of all aspects of the wound healing process in aging mouse skin. In short, this study explored the anti-aging effects of polysaccharides from Gastrodia elata, which might serve as both a treatment and an auxiliary for aging skin wounds. Additionally, the Gastrodia elata polysaccharide hydrogel was expected to be a promising drug carrier for skin repair.",

      "abstract": "Wounds are one of the most critical clinical issues in plastic surgery repair and restoration. Conventional wound dressing materials cannot absorb enough wound exudates and shield the site from microbial infection. Also, despite their healing prowess, bioactive molecules from medicinal plants are less bioavailable at the wound sites. This study developed a 3D-printed hydrogel of sodium alginate and gelatin loaded with freeze-dried Aloe barbadensis extract for enhanced wound healing. The hydrogel was hydrophilic and showed an average pore size of 163.66 ± 14.45 μm, moderate swellability, and ideal mechanical properties with tensile strength(σ) of 16.39 ± 0.98 MPa, and Young's modulus of 17.43 ± 1.41 MPa. They showed potential antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (87.7 ± 4 % inhibition) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (84.4 ± 6 % inhibition). These hydrogels were hemocompatible, biocompatible, and biodegradable. Cell cytotoxicity assay and scratch assay showed effective Normal Human Dermal Fibroblast cells (NHDF) viability, proliferation, and migration on the hydrogel. In vivo studies of the 3D-printed hydrogel demonstrated significantly improved wound closure, reduced wound contraction, enhanced epithelial regeneration with minimal inflammation, and decreased scar formation after 14 days of treatment. Therefore, this 3D-printed hydrogel can be promising for wound healing with scar reduction.",

Stalled erythropoiesis and oxidative stress-induced hemocyte apoptosis are the main pathological features of AA, yet therapeutic agents that address these issues remain elusive. In this study, we report distinctive donkey-hide gelatin-derived carbon dots (G-CDs) that enable erythropoiesis activation and oxidative stress elimination to tackle refractory AA. We demonstrate that G-CDs can promote the proliferation and erythroid differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells as well as erythrocyte maturation, activating the whole process of erythropoiesis. Moreover, G-CDs display multienzyme-like activities and dramatically alleviate the oxidative stress of bone marrow and peripheral blood via catalytic scavenging of multiple reactive oxygen species, reconstructing the hematopoietic microenvironment. Intravenously or orally administered to AA mice induced by chemotherapy drugs, G-CDs significantly boost the level of red blood cells and hemoglobin and lead to the complete recovery of hematopoietic function, showing better therapeutic performance than clinically approved erythropoietin (EPO) without adverse effects. By collaboratively addressing the issues of stalled erythropoiesis and oxidative stress, the G-CDs-based intervention strategy may offer a powerful paradigm for clinical AA management.",

In this work, HIPEs were constructed by gelatin with various properties that were obtained by heat treatment. The results indicated that the gelatin undergoes degradation gradually with an increase in heating intensity. The highest values of intrinsic fluorescence intensity, surface hydrophobicity, and emulsification were obtained when the heating time was 5 h. The gel strength and hardness of gelatin hydrogels were negatively correlated with heat treatment temperature. HIPEs constructed by gelatin extracted at 70 °C demonstrated a suitable material for 3D printing. The storage modulus (G') and viscosity of HIPEs exhibited a similar tendency as the gel strength of gelatin. The microstructure of HIPEs revealed that gelatin established a gel network around oil droplets, and the higher G' of HIPEs corresponded to a more compact network structure. This study elucidated the correlation between the structure and properties of gelatin, offering essential insights for the formulation of HIPEs by natural gelatin, which is suitable for applications across several domains."

Methodology We enrolled a total of 42 patients with tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs) (44 ears; right:left = 21:23) that were treated using gelatin sponge, recombinant bFGF, and fibrin glue between July 2020 and December 2023 at Yokosuka Kyosai Hospital. TMP closure rates, improvement of hearing level, and complications were retrospectively included in the evaluation items. TMP was evaluated at least one month after surgery. The treatment was repeated up to four times until the TMP was completely closed. Results The perforation size distribution was as follows: grade I, 30 ears (68.1%); grade II, 11 ears (25.0%); and grade III, three ears (6.8%). The overall closure rate for TMP was 84.1% (37/44). Closure was achieved in 72.7% (32/44) after the first treatment and 11.4% (5/44) after the second treatment. No closures were achieved after the third and fourth treatments. Factors contributing to the incomplete closure of TMPs included patient refusal of surgery more than once, and the disappearance of the gelatin sponge one week after each surgery. Mean air-conduction thresholds and mean air-bone gaps improved after TMP closure in successful patients; however, no change in mean bone-conduction thresholds was observed at any frequency. No serious complications were observed. Conclusions We found high success rates for TMP closure, good hearing recovery, and no severe complications. Our findings suggest that our novel technique has favorable outcomes."

This study synthesized hybrid hydrogels for photodynamic therapy using electron beam-initiated polymerization with varying PEGDA/gelatin ratios and irradiation doses to evaluate their effectiveness as uptake and release systems for five photosensitizers. Toluidine blue, O (TBO); methylene blue (MB); eosin, Y; indocyanine, green; and sodium meso-tetraphenylporphine-4,4',4″,4‴-tetrasulfonate were studied for their uptake and release dynamics in relation to their structural properties and the hydrogels' composition. Uptake was influenced by the gelatin ratio and ionic properties, with anionic photosensitizers achieving over 80% uptake while cationic ones remained below 45%. Increased irradiation doses highlighted the roles of ionic interactions, hydrophilicity, and surface polarity. Cationic photosensitizers produced singlet oxygen 9-10 times more efficiently. Nontoxic PEGDA/gelatin hydrogels demonstrated photosensitizer-dependent cytotoxicity, with TBO and MB consistent with previous findings.

Bioactive compounds from traditional medicinal plants help heal wounds, although their bioavailability is low. This study uses sodium alginate (SA), gelatin (G), and Santalum album oil (SAL) to 3D print a polymeric hydrogel scaffold to circumvent these difficulties. The 3D printed scaffolds showed hydrophilicity, an average pore size of 221.30 ± 19.83 µm, adequate swelling, higher mechanical strength with tensile strength (σ) of 13.5 ± 1.08 MPa, a Young's modulus of 17.53 ± 1.61 MPa, andpotential antibacterial activity against skin infection causing bacteria viz. Staphylococcus aureus (87.7 ± 4 % growth inhibition) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (i.e. 81.96 ± 3.94 % growth inhibition). The scaffolds showed hemocompatibility, biocompatibility, and moderate biodegradability. Cytotoxicity and scratch assay showed significantly improved fibroblast viability, proliferation, and migration. In the in vivo study, the scaffolds were applied to full-thickness wounds in rat models. After 7 and 14 days of treatment, the wounds treated with the 3D-printed SA-G-SAL scaffold showed higher closure rates, lower contraction, higher-regenerated epithelium with minimal inflammation, and less scar formation compared to control groups. Thus, the 3D-printed SA-G-SAL scaffold is a promising biomaterial for wound healing with reduced scar formation.",

The influence of molecular weight distribution (MWD) on gelatin gel strength was examined, along with the effects of these different MW fractions on microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) cross-linking gelatin. The results showed that, without MTGase treatment, high-MW fractions acted as key fillers in the formation of gelatin gel networks, while α-chains and their aggregates played a central role. In contrast, the gelation ability of low-MW fractions was negligible. MTGase cross-linking significantly increased gel strength in both high- and low-MW samples. For instance, the gel strength of the high-MW sample enhanced from 874.4 g to 1425.9 g, while that of the low-MW sample rose from 186.4 g to 340.4 g. However, gelatin with an MWD featuring fewer high- and low-MW fractions and a higher proportion of α-chains and their aggregates, exhibited a significant decrease in gel strength, which declined from 740.8 g to 560.0 g. These findings emphasized the distinct impact of MW fractions on enzymatic gelation.",

However, the characteristics of hypoxia, high H2O2 microenvironment, and the formation of persistent biofilms in diabetic wound sites limit its efficacy in this field. To address these issues, we developed a multifunctional antibacterial hydrogel dressing PPCN@Pt-AMPs/HGel with the cross-linked gelatin and sodium alginate as the matrix, where the nanosonosensitizer PCN-224 was decorated with the oxygen-generating Pt nanoenzyme and further coupled with a biofilm-targeting antimicrobial peptide via an interacting polydopamine layer. This nano-composite hydrogel displayed improved mechanical properties as well as good biocompatibility and biodegradability. The catalase-like activity of the nanoparticles facilitated the ultrasound-induced generation of the singlet oxygen due to the catalytic decomposition of the H2O2 into O2. In vitro results showed that the hydrogel dressing exhibited excellent antimicrobial ability under low-intensity ultrasound stimulation, which could effectively inhibit the newly formed biofilm and eliminate the full-grown biofilms. In the infected diabetic wound of rats, PPCN@Pt-AMPs/HGel significantly enhanced the wound healing rate under low-intensity ultrasound stimulation and improved the regeneration outcomes by promoting granulation tissue formation, angiogenesis, and type III collagen deposition. In conclusion, our study provides a novel and effective antibacterial hydrogel dressing for sonodynamic treatment of diabetic wounds.",

However, the development cycle for anticancer drugs is lengthy and the failure rate is high, highlighting the urgent need for new tumor models for CRC-related research. The decellular matrix (dECM) offers numerous cell adhesion sites, proteoglycan and cytokines. Notably, porcine small intestine is rich in capillaries and lymphatic capillaries, which facilitates nutrient absorption. This study, we utilized dECM, along with methylacryloyl gelatin (GelMA), sodium alginate (SA) and nanoclay (NC) to create a hydrogel scaffold through 3D extrusion bioprinting. Human CRC cells (HCT8) were seeded onto the scaffold and their drug resistance was tested using 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Our findings indicate that dECM enhances the hydrophilic properties, mechanical strength and biocompatibility of the scaffold. Furthermore, compared to traditional two-dimensional (2D) models, the three-dimensional (3D) scaffold supports the long-term growth of tumor spheres. After 2 days of 5-FU treatment, the cell survival rate reaches 88.06 ± 0.51 %. This suggests that our scaffold provides a promising alternative platform for in vitro research on cancer mechanisms, anti-cancer drug screening and new drug development.",

The substances include silicon dioxide (SiO2) and iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanofluids, gelatin biopolymer, surfactants (sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)), Fe3O4/SDS, seawater, and salt solutions (sodium chloride (NaCl) and calcium chloride (CaCl2)). Initially, water-wet rocks were exposed to crude oil for 22 days, resulting in significant contact angle changes. Dolomite and calcite contact angles increased from 56.50° and 50.70° to 107.70° and 104.00°, respectively, due to the presence of heavy and polar elements in the oil. The impact of aging time (7 and 11 days) on rock wettability was studied. Oil-wet rocks were treated with SiO2 and Fe3O4 nanofluids and SDS surfactants for 11 days. The contact angles of the treated rocks decreased significantly. For instance, the contact angles of dolomite and calcite treated with SDS surfactants decreased to 39.07° and 27.38°, respectively, indicating water-wet conditions. Dolomite and calcite surfaces aged with gelatin decreased the contact angles to 38.40° and 34.52°, respectively. Treatment with SiO2 nanofluid reduced the contact angles of dolomite and calcite to 54.27° and 53.17°, respectively, while treatment with Fe3O4 nanofluid decreased the contact angles to 46.08° and 51.16°, respectively. Using Fe3O4/gelatin nanocomposite resulted in contact angles of 26.00° for dolomite and 24.10° for calcite. The wettability alteration mechanism in nanofluids is attributed to structural disjoining pressure. Additionally, NaCl and CaCl2 solutions induced water-wet conditions, known as the salting-out effect, on dolomite and calcite specimens. Consequently, this study demonstrates the potential of various substances, such as nanofluids, surfactants, and salt solutions, to modify rock wettability and improve conditions for enhanced oil recovery."

      "abstract": "Yellowfin tuna skin waste is a potential collagen source for gelatin through hydrolysis. Enzymatic hydrolysis is eco-friendly but expensive, necessitating efficiency improvements. Ultrasound pre-treatment enhances efficiency via cavitation effects. This study evaluated the effects of ultrasound amplitude, pre-treatment duration, enzyme concentration, and hydrolysis duration on yield; determined optimal conditions for ultrasound-assisted enzymatic extraction on yield, viscosity, and gel strength; and assessed the gelatin's physicochemical and functional properties. This research consists of three stages, factor screening using one variable at a time, optimization using response surface methodology with Box-Behnken design, and gelatin characterization. The study included three replicates. Screening identified factor ranges for optimization: 5-25 min pre-treatment, 1%-3% enzyme concentration, and 1-5 h hydrolysis. Optimization involved 15 experimental runs, focusing on yield, viscosity, and gel strength. Optimal conditions were 25 min pre-treatment, 1% enzyme concentration, and 2.17 h hydrolysis, yielding 64.08%, 9.29 mPa·s viscosity, and 166.28 bloom gel strength. The optimized gelatin showed emulsifying properties with EAI 50.5 m2/g and ESI 23.80 min, water-oil holding capacities of 192% and 406%, respectively, antioxidant activity of 60.16%, and molecular weight range of 17-160 kDa. The amino acid composition was mainly glycine (29.26%) and proline (18.26%), with 76.95% digestibility. This innovative, environmentally friendly extraction method improved gelatin extraction efficiency from yellowfin tuna skin, supporting a sustainable industry.",

Herein, we constructed a clean and sustainable gelatin extraction method, investigated the molecular mechanism of microwave treatment (0-360 min) and freeze-thaw on the gelatin extraction from the perspective of the crosslinking degree and hydrogen bonds. Microwave (0-60 min) can improve the hydrolysis degree (DH) and expose more enzyme cleavage sites of collagen by destroying the intramolecular and intermolecular covalent crosslinking. Freeze-thaw loosened the collagen structure mainly by destroying hydrogen bonds, further increased degree of freedom, DH and enzyme cleavage sites, improved the gelatin yield and gel strength. However, the long-term microwave treatment (60-360 min) severely damaged the covalent crosslinking, increased the DH and enzyme cleavage sites. Freeze-thaw further loosened the collagen structure, caused the rapid dissolution and degradation of subunit, improved the gelatin yield and reduced the gels strength.",

In order to promote the restoration of local microenvironment stability, a functional biomaterial Gelatin methacryloyl @MP196/exos based on characteristics of disease occurrence is designed. METHODS: Transmission electron microscopy, nanosight particle tracking analysis and western blot analysis were applied to prove the presence of exos in GelMA@MP196/exos. The swelling and degradation rates of GelMA@MP196/exos were evaluated. Cell proliferation, antibacterial ability and cellular uptake and intracellular internalization of exos were assessed in the study. Efferocytosis and M2 polarization of macrophages was estimated and the effects of GelMA@MP196/exos were proved in vivo. RESULTS: GelMA@MP196/exos upregulated the expression of genes and proteins related to neutrophil apoptosis and promoted neutrophil apoptosis, macrophage M2 polarization, and efferocytosis. Furthermore, GelMA@MP196/exos exhibited significant antibacterial activity against Streptococcus gordonii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. GelMA@MP196/exos alleviated periodontitis and reduced alveolar bone loss in vivo in rat models. CONCLUSIONS: GelMA@MP196/exos can serve as a potential strategy for the treatment of periodontitis. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The main aim of periodontal therapy is to remove dental plaque and eliminate inflammation. However, some patients with low plaque scores and insufficient neutrophil clearance, resulting in poor responsiveness to periodontal therapy. Under the circumstances, local Application of drug that regulate the immune microenvironment had significance in controlling the progression of inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Conventional treatment of prostate cancer need more specificity, and higher efficiency. The present work is the first attempt to utilize hydrogel-loaded carvacrol-based chemotherapy with fractionated photothermal therapy (F-PTT) using a 635 nm laser for its treatment. Gold nanobipyramids (AuNBPs) were used as drug carrier and photosensitizer. A marine-derived hydrogel (AuNBP-HG) was fabricated and physicochemically characterized. A 635 nm NIR light was used for the fractionated PTT in three cycles of treatment on different days at varying power densities for 5 min. The efficiency of single and dual treatments was experimented in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that the dual therapy imparted a better effect than monotherapy. The AuNBP-CVL synthesized was nearly 50 nm and efficiently loaded within AuNBP-HG, displaying thermal responsiveness, a good sol-gel transition, a controlled drug release rate, and high stability. In vitro evaluation demonstrated that the F-PTT evinced stability during temperature rise without damaging healthy surrounding tissue. In vivo study revealed that a stable temperature rise up to 60 °C by the 635 nm NIR light due to photosensitization of AuNBP and sustained CVL release from AuNBP-HG into the tumor microenvironment exhibited successful thermal ablation of the cancer cells. Histological analysis confirmed that the uniform suspension of AuNBP within cancer tissues might have enhanced tumor cell lysis during the dual therapy. Western blot analysis exhibited that the cellular death could result from the upregulation of pJNK and p53 protein. In conclusion, the current study illustrated that dual therapy could be a feasible alternative to non-target specific and invasive traditional therapies against prostate cancer.",

      "abstract": "Prolonged use of Personal Protective Equipment, like surgical masks, can cause skin issues such as acne (\"maskne\") and rosacea flare-ups due to pressure and moisture. While dressings can protect the skin, they often reduce mask effectiveness and lack pharmaceuticals to treat common skin lesions. This study introduces an innovative dual-function gelatin/tannic acid-based hydrogel patch incorporating metronidazole (1% w/w) or salicylic acid (2% w/w) to offer both skin protection and treatment. The hydrogels were characterized for gelation temperature, burst strength, extensibility, adhesivity, and tribological properties to assess the effects of the active ingredients on their mechanical performance. In vitro release studies using Franz diffusion cells under occlusive conditions evaluated the drug release profile from the patches. Results showed that gelatin/tannic acid and gelatin/tannic acid-metronidazole hydrogels had similar gelation temperatures (41.65 ± 1.95 °C), while the salicylic acid formulation exhibited a lower gelation temperature (33.24 ± 0.40 °C). Adhesivity improved with the addition of active ingredients, increasing by about 0.5 N, and burst strength significantly increased with metronidazole (about 6 N). Both formulations demonstrated enhanced extensibility and were suitable for all skin types in tribological studies. The in vitro release studies showed an initial burst release followed by controlled release, unaffected by mask placement. These findings suggest that dual-function hydrogel patches could provide effective skin protection and improve skin health during prolonged mask use, offering a promising solution for conditions like \"maskne\" and rosacea.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis, characterized by decreased bone mineral density due to an imbalance between osteoblast and osteoclast activity, poses significant challenges in bone healing, particularly in postmenopausal women. Current treatments, such as bisphosphonates, are effective but associated with adverse effects like medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw, necessitating safer alternatives. METHODS: This study investigated the use of L-serine-incorporated gelatin sponges for bone regeneration in calvarial defects in an ovariectomized rat model of osteoporosis. Thirty rats were divided into three groups: a control group, a group treated with a gelatin sponge containing an amino acid mixture, and a group treated with a gelatin sponge containing L-serine. Bone regeneration was assessed using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histological analyses. RESULTS: The L-serine group showed a significant increase in bone volume (BV) and bone area compared to the control and amino acid groups. The bone volume to total volume (BV/TV) ratio was also significantly higher in the L-serine group. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that L-serine treatment suppressed the expression of cathepsin K, a marker of osteoclast activity, while increasing serine racemase activity. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that L-serine-incorporated gelatin sponges not only enhance bone formation but also inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, providing a promising and safer alternative to current therapies for osteoporosis-related bone defects. Further research is needed to explore its clinical applications in human patients.",
