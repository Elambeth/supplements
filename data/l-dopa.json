      "abstract": "L-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is effective at alleviating motor impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients but has mixed effects on nonmotor symptoms and causes adverse effects after prolonged treatment. Here, we analyzed the spatial profile of L-DOPA-induced gene expression in the forebrain of mice with an inducible progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons (the TIF-IADATCreERT2 strain), with a focus on the similarities and differences in areas relevant to different PD symptoms. The animals received a 14-day L-DOPA treatment, and 1 h after the final drug injection, a spatial transcriptome analysis was performed on coronal forebrain sections. A total of 121 genes were identified as being regulated by L-DOPA. We found that the treatment had widespread effects extending beyond the primary areas involved in dopamine-dependent movement control. An unsupervised clustering analysis of the transcripts recapitulated the forebrain anatomy and indicated both ubiquitous and region-specific effects on transcription. The changes were most pronounced in layers 2/3 and 5 of the dorsal cortex and the dorsal striatum, where a robust increase in the abundance of activity-regulated transcripts, including Fos, Egr1, and Junb, was observed. Conversely, transcripts with a decreased abundance, e.g., Plekhm2 or Pgs1, were identified primarily in the piriform cortex, the adjacent endopiriform nucleus, and the claustrum. Taken together, our spatial analysis of L-DOPA-induced alterations in gene expression reveals the anatomical complexity of treatment effects, identifying novel genes affected by the drug, as well as molecular activation in brain areas relevant to the nonmotor symptoms of PD."

      "abstract": "L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanin (L-DOPA) is the most effective drug for treating Parkinson's disease (PD); however, long-term L-DOPA therapy can lead to L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). While the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rodent model for LID fails to reproduce the pathological hallmarks of PD, a newly introduced rodent model using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated overexpression of α-synuclein results in α-synuclein aggregation and progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons. The present study aimed to provoke LID in parkinsonian mice generated by AAV vector-mediated overexpression of α-synuclein and to explore histologic features associated with LID. A recombinant AAV2/7 vector containing the human α-synuclein transgene was injected into the substantia nigra (SN) of wild-type mice. Eight weeks later, mice received daily injections of 10 mg/kg of L-DOPA for one week, followed by 25 mg/kg of L-DOPA daily for the subsequent week. LID was observed in 3 out of 19 mice at the 10 mg/kg L-DOPA dose and in 14 mice at 25 mg/kg dose. The number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in the AAV vector-injected side of the SN was reduced to an average of 59 % of the intact side, and the optical density of TH-positive fibers in the ipsilateral striatum was reduced to an average of 37 %. Abnormal Involuntary Movement scores were correlated with decrease in both the number of TH-positive neurons in SN and optical density of striatal TH-positive fibers. This study establishes a mouse model for LID using AAV vector-mediated overexpression of α-synuclein, providing a useful tool for investigating the progressive changes and associated pathophysiology during occurrence of LID.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Identifying intrinsic pattern of Parkinson's disease (PD) helps to better understand of PD and provide insights to disease identification and treatment monitoring. Here we confirmed the PD-related covariance pattern (PDRP) by using arterial spin labelling technology (ASL-PDRP) and explore its potential for predicting motor progression and levodopa (L-DOPA) reactivity reduction. METHODS: Data from an original cohort of 179 PD and 62 normal controls (NC) and a validation cohort including 36 PD and 19 NC to construct and validate the ASL-PDRP. The correlations between the pattern and motor symptoms were analyzed cross-sectionally and longitudinally (71 PD owned longitudinal data) with hierarchical linear regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted in 54 L-DOPA-managed PD patients to predict the levodopa reactivity reduction. RESULTS: The first principal component was predominantly recognized as the ASL-PDRP, with its expression being higher in PD than NC in both sets (original: P = 0.017, AUC = 0.598; validation: P = 0.024, AUC = 0.661). The pattern expression was associated with UPDRS III (P = 0.006) and sub-symptoms (axial: P < 0.001; rigidity: P = 0.003; bradykinesia: P = 0.015) at baseline. The ASL-PDRP could predict the progression of UPDRS III (P = 0.021, β = 4.930). Higher expression of the pattern had slower rate of levodopa reactivity reduction in PD patients with axial symptom (P = 0.031). CONCLUSION: The identified ASL-PDRP may have potential for characterizing PD with the ability to predict motor progression and L-DOPA reactivity reduction."

      "abstract": "The neurodegenerative condition known as Parkinson's disease (PD) is a long-term condition that causes both motor and non-motor symptoms. It is known that curcumin has a strong neuroprotective potential. This experimental study was designed to examine the anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective effects of curcumin administered alone and in combination with L-DOPA in the hippocampus as well as behavioral symptoms in rotenone-induced PD model. Forty-two 4-month-old adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups as follows: Control, Curcumin, Rotenone, Rotenone plus curcumin, Rotenone plus L-DOPA and Rotenone plus curcumin plus L-DOPA. Control group received vehicles, curcumin group received curcumin (200 mg kg-1, daily for 35 days), rotenone group received rotenone (2 mg kg-1, daily for 35 days), and test groups received curcumin or L-DOPA (10 mg kg-1, daily for the last 15 days) or their combination in addition the rotenone. Pole, sucrose preference, open field, elevated plus maze, and Morris water maze tests were performed after treatment. Molecular and biochemical analyses were performed in the hippocampus tissue and serum samples. Rotenone injection caused impairments in motor activity, depressive-like behavior, and learning and memory functions. Rotenone also increased the expressions of α-synuclein, caspase 3, NF-κB, and decreased the expressions of parkin and BDNF in the hippocampus. However, especially curcumin and L-DOPA combined treatment normalized all these impaired molecular and behavioral variables. In conclusion, curcumin may exert beneficial effects in treatment strategies for PD-related hippocampal effects, especially when added to L-DOPA therapy.",

      "abstract": "L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) is an incapacitating complication of long-term administration of L-dopa therapy that commonly affects patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) due to the widespread use of the causative drug. Herein, we investigated the therapeutic potential of sitagliptin, a drug used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, to treat LID. 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was unilaterally injected into the left side of the substantia nigra pas compacta to induce a mouse model of PD. After four weeks of 6-OHDA induction, L-dopa was administered with or without sitagliptin for 11 consecutive days. LID was monitored using abnormal involuntary movement (AIM) scoring, conducted on days 5 and 10 of L-dopa treatment. Comparative proteomic analysis was performed on the 6-OHDA-lesioned striatum by comparing groups treated with vehicle + L-dopa and sitagliptin + L-dopa. Sitagliptin combined with L-dopa significantly attenuated AIM scores in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice. Proteomic analysis following sitagliptin treatment showed an increase in proteins involved in mitochondrial function regulation and a decrease in proteins associated with cytoskeleton function regulation. Changes in the expression of Ndufb2, a subunit of NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I), and Arc, an immediate early gene (IEG), which showed the most significant increase and decrease, respectively, were validated using western blotting and RT-PCR analysis. These findings suggest that sitagliptin may have therapeutic potential by enhancing mitochondrial functions and suppressing neuronal activity in the striatum, thereby mitigating the incapacitating complications associated with long-term L-dopa use in patients with PD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reduced arm swing movements during gait are an early motor manifestation of Parkinson's disease (PD). The clinical evolution, response to L-Dopa and pathophysiological underpinning of abnormal arm swing movements in PD remain largely unclear. By using a network of wearable sensors, this study objectively assesses arm swing movements during gait in PD patients across different disease stages and therapeutic conditions. METHODS: Twenty healthy subjects (HS) and 40 PD patients, including 20 early-stage and 20 mid-advanced subjects, underwent a 6-m Timed Up and Go test while monitored through a network of wearable inertial sensors. Arm swing movements were objectively evaluated in both hemibodies and different upper limb joints (shoulder and elbow), using specific time-domain (range of motion and velocity) and frequency-domain measures (harmonics and total harmonic distortion). To assess the effects of L-Dopa, patients under chronic dopaminergic therapy were randomly examined when OFF and ON therapy. Finally, clinical-behavioral correlations were investigated, primarily focusing on the relationship between arm swing movements and cardinal L-Dopa-responsive motor signs, including bradykinesia and rigidity. RESULTS: Compared to HS, the whole group of PD patients showed reduced range of motion and velocity, alongside increased asymmetry of arm swing movements during gait. Additionally, a distinct increase in total harmonic distortion was found in patients. The kinematic changes were prominent in the early stage of the disease and progressively worsened owing to the involvement of the less affected hemibody. The time- and frequency-domain abnormalities were comparable in the two joints (i.e., shoulder and elbow). In the subgroup of patients under chronic dopaminergic treatment, L-Dopa restored patterns of arm swing movements. Finally, the kinematic alterations in arm swing movements during gait correlated with the clinical severity of bradykinesia and rigidity. CONCLUSIONS: Arm swing movements during gait in PD are characterized by narrow, slow, and irregular patterns. As the disease progresses, arm swing movements deteriorate also in the less affected hemibody, without any joint specificity. The positive response to L-Dopa along with the significant correlation between kinematics and bradykinesia/rigidity scores points to the involvement of dopaminergic pathways in the pathophysiology of abnormal arm swing movements in PD.",

This study was carried out to determine the effects of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on the biofortification potential of faba beans. The study utilized Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, and an AMF mix to examine changes in growth parameters, chlorophyll content, bioactive compounds, and mineral nutrients. AMF and PGPR treatments significantly enhanced various traits in faba bean pods compared to untreated control plants. Bacillus subtilis treatment increased the antioxidant capacity by 128% and the total phenol content by 230%. AMF inoculation elevated the L-Dopa content, an essential compound for Parkinson's disease prevention, by 92%. Protein content increased by 51% with Bacillus megaterium inoculations. The macro and micronutrients exhibited the highest enhancement in AMF treatment (Ca; 33.6%, K; 49.4%, Mg; 22.7%, P; 10.5%, Fe; 37.7%, Zn; 24.5%). The study results suggest that AMF and PGPR inoculation to faba bean seeds improves the morphological characteristics, bioactive compounds, and mineral nutrient content and is an excellent tool for obtaining biofortified faba beans through sustainable practice.",

This review explores the roles of NF-κB and TNF-α signalling pathways in LID pathophysiology and potential therapeutic approaches targeting these mechanisms. Chronic levodopa treatment leads to aberrant neuroplasticity and neuroinflammation, involving activation of NF-κB and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α. NF-κB activation in glial cells contributes to sustained neuroinflammation and exacerbates dopaminergic neuron loss. TNF-α levels are elevated in brain regions affected by LID and correlate with dyskinesia severity. Several compounds are involved in mitigating LID by modulating these pathways. Agmatine reduces NF-κB activation and NMDA receptor expression while protecting dopaminergic neurons. Resveratrol and doxycycline demonstrate antidyskinetic effects by attenuating neuroinflammation and TNF-α production. The Rho-kinase (ROCK) inhibitor fasudil and cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) receptor agonists also show efficacy in reducing LID severity and neuroinflammation. Hydrogen gas inhalation decreases pro-inflammatory cytokine levels associated with LID. These findings highlight the complex interplay between NF-κB, TNF-α and other neurotransmitter systems in LID pathogenesis. Targeting neuroinflammation and glial activation through these pathways represents a promising strategy for developing novel LID treatments. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms and optimize therapeutic approaches targeting NF-κB and TNF-α signalling in LID.",

Dopamine does not cross the digestive and blood-brain barriers and is rapidly oxidized. The new concept is the intracerebroventricular administration of anaerobic dopamine (A-dopamine) using an abdominal pump connected to a subcutaneous catheter implanted in the third ventricle, near the striatum. An open-label phase 1 study showed no serious adverse reactions induced by A-dopamine in 12 patients. A randomized, controlled, open-label, crossover phase 2 study of 1 month of A-dopamine versus 1 month of optimized oral antiparkinsonian therapy was conducted in 9 patients. The primary endpoint, a blinded assessment of the percentage over target (that is, time with dyskinesia or bradykinesia), recorded by home actimetry using a wristwatch, was significantly reduced on A-dopamine compared with that on oral treatment alone (P = 0.027), with a median within-patient difference of -10.4 (Hedge g = -0.62 (95% confidence interval: -1.43, -0.08)). Home diaries were also significantly improved.

Understanding these effects is essential for optimizing treatment strategies and assessing disease severity. Magnetoencephalogram (MEG) data provide a continuous time series signal that reflects the dynamic changes in brain activity. The hidden Markov model (HMM) can capture and model the temporal features and underlying states of the MEG signal to extract potential brain states and monitor dynamic changes. In this study, we employed HMM to investigate the cortical mechanism underlying the treatment of PD patients using MEG recordings. METHODS: 21 PD patients treated with medication underwent MEG recording in both L-dopa medoff and medon conditions. Additionally, 11 PD patients receiving STN-DBS treatment underwent MEG recording in both dbsoff and dbson conditions. The MEG data were segmented into four states by Time-delay embedded Hidden Markov Model (TDE-HMM) algorithm. The state parameters including Fractional Occupancy (FO), Interval Times (IT), and Life Time (LT) for each state and power spectrum of β band were analyzed to study the effects of L-dopa and STN-DBS treatment respectively. RESULTS: L-dopa significantly increased the motor state of HMM and power in the motor area of both high β (21-35 Hz) and low β (13-20 Hz); the motor state of high β in medoff were correlated with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III). Conversely, DBS significantly diminishes the motor state of HMM and power in motor area of high β oscillations. The score changes of tremor and limb rigidity after DBS treatment were significantly correlated with the changes of motor state of high β. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that L-dopa and STN-DBS exert differing effects on β oscillations in the motor cortex of PD patients, primarily in high β band. Understanding these distinct neurophysiological impacts can provide valuable insights for refining therapeutic approaches in motor control for PD patients.",

Therefore, novel and more effective targeted or combined therapies, such as specific drug delivery systems that selectively target cancer cells, have received much attention. This research aimed to investigate the effect of targeted delivery of chrysin (CH) and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) using polymer nanoparticles on MDA-MB-231 cells. In this regard, CH and 5FU were individually used as the template to polymerize L-DOPA on the surface of silica nanoparticles. Then, a CD138-targeting peptide was designed for the first time and immobilized on the surface of the polymeric nanocomposite to target TNBC. The results showed that poly(L-DOPA)-CH-peptide and poly(L-DOPA)-5FU-peptide are selective for MDA-MB-231 cells and deliver drugs to them in a targeted manner. In this study, peptide-containing nanocomposites targeting CD138 were more successful in reducing cell proliferation than peptide-free nanocomposites. Also, they increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells in vitro. The effective and targeted delivery of CH and 5FU to MDA-MB-231 cancer cells by the designed interference peptide in this study can promise an effective treatment method for inhibiting the growth and progression of cancer. However, animal studies are needed to understand the efficacy of the interfering peptide and the final designed construct."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease (PD) is commonly characterized by severe dopamine (DA) depletion within the substantia nigra (SN) leading to a myriad of motor and non-motor symptoms. One underappreciated and prevalent non-motor symptom, Parkinson's disease-associated psychosis (PDAP), significantly erodes patient and caregiver quality of life yet remains vastly understudied. While the gold standard pharmacotherapy for motor symptoms Levodopa (LD) is initially highly effective, it can lead to motor fluctuations like LD-induced dyskinesia (LID) and non-motor fluctuations such as intermittent PDAP. One source of these fluctuations could be the serotonergic raphe nuclei and their projections. Serotonin (5-HT) neurons possess the machinery necessary to convert and release DA from exogenous LD. In DA-depleted brain regions these 5-HT projections can act as surrogates to the DA system initially compensating but chronically leading to aberrant neuroplasticity which has been linked to LID and may also contribute to non-motor fluctuations. In support, recent work from our lab established a positive relationship between LID and PDAP in parkinsonian rats. Therefore, it was hypothesized that normalizing 5-HT forebrain input would reduce the co-expression of LID and PDAP. METHODS: To do so, we expressed 5-HT projection specific inhibitory designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) using Cre-dependent AAV9-hM4di in tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2)-Cre bilaterally 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Thereafter we used the designer drug Compound 21 to selectively inhibit 5-HT raphe projections during LD treatment to modulate the expression of PDAP, assayed by prepulse inhibition (PPI) and LID, quantified by the abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) test. RESULTS: Our results suggest that chemogenetic inhibition of 5-HT raphe-projecting cells significantly reduces LID without affecting stepping ability or established sensorimotor gating deficits. DISCUSSION: Overall, this study provides further evidence for the complex influence of 5-HT raphe-projecting neurons on LD's neurobehavioral effects.",

      "abstract": "Treatment with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-Dopa) compensates for decreased striatal dopamine (DA) levels and reduces Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms. However, during disease progression, L-Dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) develops virtually in all PD patients, making the control of PD symptoms difficult. Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying LID and the control of these motor abnormalities is a major issue in the care of PD patients. From experimental and clinical studies, a complex cascade of molecular and cellular events emerges, but the primary determinants of LID are still unclear. Here, with a translational approach, including four animal models and a wide cohort of PD patients, we show that striatal DA denervation is the major causal factor for the emergence of LID, while α-synuclein aggregates do not seem to play a significant role. Our data also support the concept that maladaptive basal ganglia plasticity is the main pathophysiological mechanism underlying LID."

      "abstract": "Hydroxytyrosol has been proven beneficial to human health. However, the process involving the conversion of L-DOPA to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (3,4-DHPAA) in hydroxytyrosol biosynthesis typically required the simultaneous use of decarboxylase and oxidative deaminase. In addition, phenylacetaldehyde reductase from Solanum lycopersicum (SlPAR) in hydroxytyrosol biosynthesis exhibits poor thermal stability. In this study, we unexpectedly discovered that L-DOPA decarboxylase from Pseudomonas putida (PpDODC) exhibits weak dual-functional activity for both decarboxylation and oxidative deamination of L-DOPA. Through a dual-function reshaping strategy, the best dual-functional mutant PpDODC/Y79F/Y324F achieved an enzyme activity of 0.95 U/mg and exhibited a 256.8-fold increase in activity compared to the wild-type. Through rational design of SlPAR, the optimal mutant SlPAR/G52D/V188I/N234W/Q286P (SlPAR-M4) maintained stability after 12 h' treatment at 40 °C. Based on these mutants, we established a simplified cascade to synthesize hydroxytyrosol from L-DOPA, achieving a hydroxytyrosol yield of 31.4 mM from 32 mM L-DOPA in a 5-hour reaction. This process achieved the highest molar conversion rate (98.2 %) currently reported for the synthesis of hydroxytyrosol from L-DOPA. This study provides a novel solution for hydroxytyrosol synthesis from a new perspective, and the mutants hold promise for widespread application in biotransformation studies of hydroxytyrosol and other structurally-similar compounds.",

      "abstract": "Levodopa (L-DOPA) treatment is a clinically effective strategy for improving motor function in patients with ischemic stroke. However, the mechanisms by which modulating the dopamine system relieves the pathology of the ischemic brain remain unclear. Emerging evidence from an experimental mouse model of ischemic stroke, established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), suggested that L-DOPA has the potential to modulate the inflammatory and immune response that occurs during a stroke. Here, we aimed to demonstrate the therapeutic effect of L-DOPA in regulating the systemic immune response and improving functional deficits in mice with ischemia. Transient MCAO led to progressive degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons and significant rotational behavior in mice. Exogenous L-DOPA treatment attenuated the striatonigral degeneration and reversed motor behavioral impairment. Notably, treatment with L-DOPA significantly increased IL-13 but reduced IFN-γ in infarct lesions. To investigate the role of IL-13 in motor behavior, we stereotaxically injected anti-IL-13 antibodies into the infarct area of the mouse brain one week after MCAO, followed by L-DOPA treatment. The intervention reduced dopamine, IL-13, and IL-10 levels and exacerbated motor function. IL-13 is potentially expressed on CD4 T cells, while IL-10 is mainly expressed on microglia rather than astrocytes. Finally, IL-13 activates the phagocytosis of microglia, which may contribute to neuroprotection by eliminating degenerating neurons. Our study provides evidence that the L-DOPA-activated dopamine system modulates peripheral immune cells, resulting in the expression of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective cytokines in mice with ischemic stroke.",

      "abstract": "A dynamic equilibrium between dopamine and acetylcholine (ACh) is essential for striatal circuitry and motor function, as imbalances are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) and levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). Conventional theories posit that cholinergic signaling is pathologically elevated in PD as a result of increased ACh release, which contributes to motor deficits. However, using approaches to measure receptor-mediated signaling, we found that, rather than the predicted enhancement, the strength of cholinergic transmission at muscarinic M4 receptor synapses on direct pathway medium spiny neurons was decreased in dopamine-depleted mice. This adaptation was due to a reduced postsynaptic M4 receptor function, resulting from down-regulated receptors and downstream signaling. Restoring M4 transmission unexpectedly led to a partial alleviation of motor deficits and LID dyskinetic behavior, revealing an unexpected prokinetic effect in addition to the canonical antikinetic role of M4 receptors. These findings indicate that decreased M4 function differentially contributes to parkinsonian and LID pathophysiology, representing a promising target for therapeutic intervention.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder typified by the loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) leading to motor symptoms including resting tremor, rigidity, akinesia, and postural instability. DA replacement therapy with levodopa (L-DOPA) remains the gold-standard treatment for the motor symptoms of PD. Unfortunately, chronic use of L-DOPA leads to the development of side effects known as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). The mechanisms underlying LID are multifaceted, but accumulating research has strongly implicated maladaptive neuroplasticity within the raphe-striatal serotonin (5-HT) circuit. The 5-HT transporter (SERT) has emerged as an intriguing therapeutic target as it is upregulated in the brains of dyskinetic patients and animal models of LID, and pharmacological blockade of SERT alters L-DOPA's effects. Therefore, the current study employed an interventional genetic knockdown of SERT (SERT-KD) to investigate its role in LID expression and LID-associated transcription factors. To do so, hemiparkinsonian, stably dyskinetic rats (N = 68) received adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) expressing either a short-hairpin RNA against SERT (SERT-shRNA) or a scrambled control shRNA (SCR-shRNA) after which LID reinstatement and motor performance were assayed over 2 weeks. Dorsal raphe and striatal tissue were collected for the expression analyses of known parkinsonian and LID-associated genes. Results demonstrated that SERT-KD significantly and durably reduced LID and L-DOPA-induced striatal cFOS mRNA without altering L-DOPA efficacy. Such findings point to SERT-mediated adaptations as a 5-HT mechanism by which L-DOPA exerts its actions and therapeutic target for LID.",

Due to low levels of dopamine, patients present with hyperprolactinemia. Treatment consists of a phenylalanine (Phe)-restricted diet, hydroxytryptophan and levodopa (L-Dopa) supplementation, leading to a rapid normalization of prolactin (PRL) levels. We report a case of a patient with DHPR deficiency presenting with new symptomatic hyperprolactinemia and amenorrhea in adolescence despite appropriate management. The prolactinoma was confirmed with pituitary magnetic resonance imaging. The patient was started on cabergoline with rapid normalization of PRL levels and resolution of symptoms, in keeping with previous reports. Cabergoline has a stronger affinity for the D2R receptor and longer half-life than L-Dopa, leading to lactotroph apoptosis, tumor shrinkage, and rapid and maintained normalization of PRL levels, with a better side-effect profile. Patients with DHPR deficiency need to be actively monitored for symptomatic hyperprolactinemia, as L-Dopa monotherapy is insufficient to suppress PRL secretion, leading to lactotroph hypertrophy and proliferation over time and development of prolactinomas in later life."

      "abstract": "The use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors in the treatment of Parkinson's disease is currently widely discussed. The study aimed to investigate the impact of acute and chronic treatment with the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, sildenafil, at low and moderate doses of 2 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, and L-DOPA (12.5 mg/kg), alone or in combination, on asymmetric behavior and dopamine (DA) and serotonin metabolism in the striatum and substantia nigra of unilaterally 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Acute administration of sildenafil at both tested doses jointly with L-DOPA significantly increased the number of contralateral rotations during a 2 h measurement compared to L-DOPA alone. The effect of a lower dose of sildenafil combined with L-DOPA was much greater in the second hour of measurement. However, the acute combined administration of a higher dose of sildenafil with L-DOPA resulted in an immediate and much stronger increase in the number of contralateral rotations compared to L-DOPA alone, already visible in the first hour of measurement. Interestingly, the chronic combined administration of 2 mg/kg of sildenafil and L-DOPA significantly reduced the number of contralateral rotations, especially during the first hour of measurement, compared to the long-term treatment with L-DOPA alone. Such an effect was not observed after the long-term combined treatment of a higher dose of sildenafil and L-DOPA compared to L-DOPA alone. The concentration of DA in the ipsilateral striatum and substantia nigra after the last combined chronic dose of sildenafil (2 or 6 mg/kg) and L-DOPA (12.5 mg/kg) was significantly higher than after L-DOPA alone. In spite of much stronger increases in the DA concentration in the ipsilateral striatum and substantia nigra, the number of contralateral rotations was reduced in the group of rats treated with the combination of 2 mg/kg sildenafil and L-DOPA compared to the group receiving L-DOPA alone. Moreover, the combined treatment with a low dose of sildenafil and L-DOPA had an opposite effect on DA catabolism, as assessed by DOPAC/DA and HVA/DA indexes, and these indexes were reduced in the ipsilateral striatum but increased in the contralateral striatum and substantia nigra compared to the treatment with L-DOPA alone. The results of the present study show that the addition of a low dose of a PDE5 inhibitor to the standard L-DOPA therapy differently modulates rotational behavior, the tissue DA concentration and its catabolism in the striatum and substantia nigra.",

      "abstract": "Treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) is based on the use of dopaminergic drugs, such as L-Dopa and dopamine receptor agonists. These substances counteract motor symptoms, but their administration is accompanied by motor and non-motor complications. Among these latter conditions a neurobehavioral disorder similar to drug abuse, known as dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS), is attracting increasing interest because of its profound negative impact on the patients' quality of life. Here we replicate DDS in a PD mouse model based on a bilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the dorsal striatum. Administration of L-Dopa induced locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference in 6-OHDA lesion, but not in control mice, indicative of the acquisition of addictive-like properties following nigrostriatal dopamine depletion. These behavioral effects were accompanied by abnormal dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) signaling in the medium spiny neurons of the dorsal striatum, leading to hyperactivation of multiple signaling cascades and increased expression of ΔFosB, a stable transcription factor involved in addictive behavior. Systemic administration of the D1R antagonist, SCH23390, abolished these effects and the development of place preference, thereby counteracting the psychostimulant-like effect of L-Dopa. The rewarding properties of L-Dopa were also prevented by chemogenetic inactivation of D1R-expressing neurons in the dorsal striatum. Our results indicate the association between abnormal D1R-mediated transmission and DDS in PD and identify potential approaches for the treatment of this disorder.",

      "abstract": "L-DOPA, or levodopa, plays an important role in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, a debilitating neurological disorder. It acts as a precursor to dopamine, a neurotransmitter crucial for the regulation of motor functions. Administered orally, L-DOPA easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and converts into dopamine in the brain, relieving symptoms such as tremors and rigidity. However, its prolonged use can lead to complications. A significant concern with L-DOPA is its conversion to dopaquinone, a quinone metabolite that enters the redox cycle and continuously produces hydrogen peroxide. In addition, L-DOPA, which resembles tyrosine with an additional hydroxyl group, can randomly incorporate into the proteins of dopaminergic neurons and thus become an additional source of oxidative stress in Parkinson's patients. In this study, we scrutinized the rate-limiting step of L-DOPA autoxidation in aqueous solution. The reaction we studied is an intramolecular Michael addition concerted with a proton transfer from the amino group. Using the Empirical Valence Bond (EVB) method, we computed the free energy profiles of the reaction in water. The calculated barrier of 30.93 ± 1.12 kcal/mol is in reasonable agreement with the experimental barrier of 27.55 kcal/mol. This agreement confirms the validity of the studied mechanism and demonstrates the applicability of our simulation methodology for studying the autoxidation kinetics of L-DOPA within proteins.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative case. As the disease progresses, the response time to doses of levodopa (L-Dopa) becomes shorter and the effects of the drug are severely limited by some undesirable side effects such as the 'on-off' phenomenon. In several diseases, including Parkinson's, nanoparticles can deliver antioxidant compounds that reduce oxidative stress. This study evaluates and compares the neuroprotective effects of L-Dopa-modified zinc nanoparticles (ZnNPs) in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rat model. For this purpose, the synthesis of NPs was carried out. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer were used for characterization. The rats were randomized into 9 experimental groups: control, lesion group (6-OHDA), 6-OHDA + 5 mg/kg L-Dopa, 6-OHDA + 10 mg/kg L-Dopa, 6-OHDA + 20 mg/kg L-Dopa, 6-OHDA + 20 mg/kg ZnNPs, 6-OHDA + 40 mg/kg ZnNPs, 6-OHDA + 30 mg/kg ZnNPs + L-Dopa, and 6-OHDA + 60 mg/kg ZnNPs + L-Dopa. Behavioral tests were performed on all groups 14 days after treatment. Phosphatase and tensin homolog, Excitatory amino acid transporter 1/2, and Glutamine synthetase gene analyses were performed on brain samples taken immediately after the tests. In addition, histological and immunohistochemical methods were used to determine the general structure and properties of the tissues. We obtained important findings that L-Dopa-modified ZnNPs increased the activity of glutamate transporters. Our experiment showed that glutamate increases neuronal cell vitality and improves behavioral performance. Therefore, L-Dopa-modified ZnNPs can be used to prevent neurotoxicity. According to what we found, results show that L-Dopa-modified ZnNPs will lend to the effective avoidance and therapy of PD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC), now the second most prevalent malignant tumor worldwide, is more prevalent in young adults. In recent decades, there has been progress in creating anti-colorectal cancer medications, including cytotoxic compounds. OBJECTIVES: Novel anticancer drugs are needed to surmount existing obstacles. A recent study investigated the effectiveness of novel formulations in preventing colorectal cancer. METHODS: During this study, we assessed a new kind of niosome called cyclo-Gly-L-DOPA (CG-Nio-CGLD) made from chitosan glutamate. We evaluated the anti-colorectal cancer properties of CG-Nio-CGLD utilizing CCK-8, invasion assay, MTT assay, flow cytometry, and cell cycle analysis. The transcription of genes associated with apoptosis was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR. At the same time, the cytotoxicity of nanomaterials on both cancer and normal cell lines was assessed using MTT assays. Novel anticancer drugs are needed to surmount existing obstacles. A recent study investigated the effectiveness of newly developed formulations in preventing colorectal cancer. RESULTS: The Nio-CGLD and CG-Nio-CGLD were spherical mean diameters of 169.12 ± 1.87 and 179.26 ± 2.17 nm, respectively. Entrapment efficiency (EE%) measurements of the Nio-CGLD and CG-Nio-CGLD were 63.12 ± 0.51 and 76.43 ± 0.34%, respectively. In the CG-Nio-CGLD group, the percentages of early, late, necrotic, and viable CL40 cells were 341.93%, 23.27%, 9.32%, and 25.48%. The transcription of the genes PP53, cas3, and cas8 was noticeably higher in the treatment group compared to the control group (P > 0.001). Additionally, the treatment group had lower BCL2 and survivin gene expression levels than the control group (P < 0.01). Additionally, CG-Nio-CGLD formulations demonstrated a biocompatible nanoscale delivery mechanism and displayed little cytotoxicity toward the CCD 841 CoN reference cell line. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that chitosan-based noisome encapsulation may enhance the effectiveness of CG-Nio-CGLD formulations in fighting cancer.",

      "abstract": "In the present study, we explored the development of a novel noninvasive liposomal drug delivery material for use in intranasal drug delivery applications in human diseases. We used drug entrapment into liposomal nanoparticle assembly to efficiently deliver the drugs to the nasal mucosa to be delivered to the brain. The naturally occurring flavonoid 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) has previously been shown to have beneficial effects in ameliorating Parkinson's disease (PD). We used both naturally occurring 7,8-DHF and the chemically modified form of DHF, the DHF-ME, to be used as a drug candidate for the treatment of PD and l-DOPA induced dyskinesia (LID), which is the debilitating side effect of l-DOPA therapy in PD. The ligand-protein interaction behavior for 7,8-DHF and 6,7-DHF-ME was found to be more effective with molecular docking and molecular stimulation studies of flavonoid compounds with TrkB receptor. Our study showed that 7,8-DHF delivered via intranasal route using a liposomal formulation ameliorated LID in hemiparkinsonian mice model when these mice were chronically administered with l-DOPA, which is the only current medication for relieving the clinical symptoms of PD. The present study also demonstrated that apart from reducing the LID, 7,8-DHF delivery directly to the brain via the intranasal route also corrected some long-term signaling adaptations involving ΔFosB and α Synuclein in the brain of dopamine (DA) depleted animals.",

Thus, when administered as monotherapy or as adjunct to a low dose of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), the mGlu2 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) LY-487,379 alleviated parkinsonism in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned primates. Here, we sought to investigate the effect of biphenyl-indanone A (BINA), a highly selective mGlu2 PAM whose chemical scaffold is unrelated to LY-487,379, to determine if a structurally different mGlu2 PAM would also confer anti-parkinsonian benefit. In monotherapy experiments, MPTP-lesioned marmosets were injected with either vehicle, L-DOPA/benserazide (15/3.75 mg/kg, positive control) or BINA (0.1, 1, 10 mg/kg). In adjunct to a low L-DOPA dose experiments, MPTP-lesioned marmosets were injected with L-DOPA/benserazide (7.5/1.875 mg/kg) in combination with vehicle or BINA (0.1, 1, 10 mg/kg). Parkinsonism, dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs) were then quantified. When administered alone, BINA 1 and 10 mg/kg decreased parkinsonism severity by ~22% (p < 0.01) and ~47% (p < 0.001), when compared with vehicle, which was comparable with the global effect of a high L-DOPA dose. When administered in combination with a low L-DOPA dose, BINA 1 and 10 mg/kg decreased global parkinsonism by ~38% (p < 0.001) and ~53% (p < 0.001). BINA 10 mg/kg decreased global dyskinesia by ~94% (p < 0.01) and global PLBs by ~92% (p < 0.01). Our results provide additional evidence that mGlu2 positive allosteric modulation elicits anti-parkinsonian effects. That this benefit is not related to a particular chemical scaffold suggests that it may be a class effect rather than the effect of a specific molecule.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is caused by a selective vulnerability and cell loss of dopaminergic neurons of the Substantia Nigra pars compacta and, consequently, striatal dopamine depletion. In Parkinson's disease therapy, dopamine loss is counteracted by the administration of L-DOPA, which is initially effective in ameliorating motor symptoms, but over time leads to a burdening side effect of uncontrollable jerky movements, termed L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. To date, no efficient treatment for dyskinesia exists. The dopaminergic and serotonergic systems are intrinsically linked, and in recent years, a role has been established for pre-synaptic 5-HT1a/b receptors in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. We hypothesized that post-synaptic serotonin receptors may have a role and investigated the effect of modulation of 5-HT4 receptor on motor symptoms and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in the unilateral 6-OHDA mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Administration of RS 67333, a 5-HT4 receptor partial agonist, reduces L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia without altering L-DOPA's pro-kinetic effect. In the dorsolateral striatum, we find 5-HT4 receptor to be predominantly expressed in D2R-containing medium spiny neurons, and its expression is altered by dopamine depletion and L-DOPA treatment. We further show that 5-HT4 receptor agonism not only reduces L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, but also enhances the activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway in striatopallidal medium spiny neurons. Taken together, our findings suggest that agonism of the post-synaptic serotonin receptor 5-HT4 may be a novel therapeutic approach to reduce L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by striatal dopamine deficiency. Since dopamine cannot cross the digestive and blood-brain barriers, its precursor, levodopa (L-DOPA), remains the mainstay of treatment. However, the significant pharmacokinetic (Pk) and pharmacodynamic (Pd) limitations of L-DOPA, combined with the severity of PD, may trigger motor and non-motor complications, for which continuous dopaminergic delivery therapies have been developed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review the literature on the Pk/Pd limitations of L-DOPA and how current treatments of continuous dopaminergic administration ameliorate these problems, in order to identify the need for new therapeutic avenues. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was carried out using PubMed and 75 articles were initially extracted. Following independent screening by two reviewers and consideration of eligibility, 10 articles were chosen for further analysis. Information concerning the Pk/Pd of L-DOPA was classified for each article. RESULTS: Pk/Pd problems notably include: (i) restricted digestive and cerebral absorption; (ii) unnecessary peripheral distribution; (iii) short half-life; (iv) age- and PD-induced decline of central aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase; (v) misdistribution in many cells; and (vii) pulsatile stimulation of dopaminergic receptors. Current treatments only slightly ameliorate some of these problems. CONCLUSIONS: Many Pk/Pd constraints are not resolved by existing continuous dopaminergic delivery therapies. This highlights the significant gap between these treatments and the ideal of continuous dopaminergic stimulation.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by dopamine (DA) cell loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). As PD progresses, patients display disruptions in gait such as changes in posture, bradykinesia, and shortened stride. DA replacement via L-DOPA alleviates many PD symptoms, though its effects on gait are not well demonstrated. This study aimed to assess the relationship between DA lesion, gait, and deficit-induced reversal with L-DOPA. To do so, Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 25, 14 males, 11 females) received unilateral medial forebrain bundle (MFB) DA lesions with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). An automated gait analysis system assessed spatiotemporal gait parameters pre- and post-lesion, and after various doses of L-DOPA (0, 3, or 6 mg/kg; s.c.). The forepaw adjusting steps (FAS) test was implemented to evaluate lesion efficacy while the abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) scale monitored the emergence of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assessed changes in brain monoamines on account of lesion and treatment. Results revealed lesion-induced impairments in gait, inclusive of max-contact area and step-sequence alterations that were not reversible with L-DOPA. However, the emergence of AIMs were observed at higher doses. Post-mortem, 6-OHDA lesions induced a loss of striatal DA and norepinephrine (NE), while prefrontal cortex (PFC) displayed noticeable reduction in NE but not DA. Our findings indicate that hemiparkinsonian rats display measurable gait disturbances similar to PD patients that are not rescued by DA replacement. Furthermore, non-DA mechanisms such as attention-related NE in PFC may contribute to altered gait and may constitute a novel target for its treatment.",

      "abstract": "Dopamine plays important roles in cognitive function and inflammation and therefore is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Drugs that increase or maintain dopamine levels in the brain could be a therapeutic strategy for AD. However, the effects of dopamine and its precursor levodopa (L-DOPA) on Aβ/tau pathology in vivo and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been studied in detail. Here, we investigated whether L-DOPA treatment alters neuroinflammation, Aβ pathology, and tau phosphorylation in 5xFAD mice, a model of AD. We found that L-DOPA administration significantly reduced microgliosis and astrogliosis in 5xFAD mice. In addition, L-DOPA treatment significantly decreased Aβ plaque number by upregulating NEP and ADAM17 levels in 5xFAD mice. However, L-DOPA-treated 5xFAD mice did not exhibit changes in tau hyperphosphorylation or tau kinase levels. These data suggest that L-DOPA alleviates neuroinflammatory responses and Aβ pathology but not tau pathology in this mouse model of AD.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysmorphology/dysfunction follow global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (GCI/R) injury, leading to neuronal death. Our previous researches demonstrated that Levodopa (L-DOPA) improves learning and memory impairment in GCI/R rats by increasing synaptic plasticity of hippocampal neurons. This study investigates if L-DOPA, used in Parkinson's disease treatment, alleviates GCI/R-induced cell death by enhancing mitochondrial quality. Metabolomics and transcriptomic results showed that GCI/R damage affected the Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the hippocampus. The results of this study show that L-DOPA stabilized mitochondrial membrane potential and ultrastructure in hippocampus of GCI/R rats, increased dopamine level in hippocampus, decreased succinic acid level, and stabilized Ca2+ level in CA1 subregion of hippocampus. As a precursor of dopamine, L-DOPA is presumed to improves mitochondrial function in hippocampus of GCI/R rats. However, dopamine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, so L-DOPA is used in clinical therapy to supplement dopamine. In this investigation, OGD/R models were established in isolated mouse hippocampal neurons (HT22) and primary rat hippocampal neurons. Notably, dopamine exhibited a multifaceted impact, demonstrating inhibition of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitoROS) production, stabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential and Ca2+ level, facilitation of TCA circulation, promotion of aerobic respiratory metabolism, and downregulation of succinic acid-related gene expression. Consistency between in vitro and in vivo results underscores dopamine's significant neuroprotective role in mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction following global cerebral hypoxia and ischemia injury. Supplement dopamine may represent a promising therapy to the cognitive impairment caused by GCI/R injury.",

      "abstract": "l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is a debilitating motor side effect arising from chronic dopamine (DA) replacement therapy with l-DOPA for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. LID is associated with supersensitivity of striatal dopaminergic signaling and fluctuations in synaptic DA following each l-DOPA dose, shrinking the therapeutic window. The heterogeneous composition of the striatum, including subpopulations of medium spiny output neurons (MSNs), interneurons, and supporting cells, complicates the identification of cell(s) underlying LID. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to establish a comprehensive striatal transcriptional profile during LID development. Male hemiparkinsonian mice were treated with vehicle or l-DOPA for 1, 5, or 10 d, and striatal nuclei were processed for snRNA-seq. Analyses indicated a limited population of DA D1 receptor-expressing MSNs (D1-MSNs) formed three subclusters in response to l-DOPA treatment and expressed cellular markers of activation. These activated D1-MSNs display similar transcriptional changes previously associated with LID; however, their prevalence and transcriptional behavior were differentially influenced by l-DOPA experience. Differentially expressed genes indicated acute upregulation of plasticity-related transcription factors and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, while repeated l-DOPA-induced synaptic remodeling, learning and memory, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling genes. Notably, repeated l-DOPA sensitized Inhba, an activin subunit of the TGF-β superfamily, in activated D1-MSNs, and its pharmacological inhibition impaired LID development, suggesting that activin signaling may play an essential role in LID. These data suggest distinct subsets of D1-MSNs become differentially l-DOPA-responsive due to aberrant induction of molecular mechanisms necessary for neuronal entrainment, similar to processes underlying hippocampal learning and memory.",

Due to the presence of carboxyl groups, the oxidative polymerization of l-DOPA to obtain particles was not as efficient as that of dopamine. Several established methods toward P(l-DOPA) NP fabrication do not combine convenience, morphological regularity, size controllability, low cost, and adaptability to metal-free application scenarios. In this work, P(l-DOPA) NPs were successfully prepared in hot water with the assistant of organic quaternary ammonium, due to the extra physical cross-linking mediated by cations. The employed physical interactions could also be affected by quaternary ammonium structure (i.e., number of cation heads, length of alkyl chain) to achieve different polymerization acceleration effects. The obtained P(l-DOPA) NPs retained superior photothermal properties and outperformed PDA-based melanin materials. Furthermore, P(l-DOPA) NPs were used in photothermal tumor therapy and showed better efficacy. This study offers new insights into the synthesis of melanin-like materials, as well as new understanding of the interaction between quaternary ammonium and bioinspired polyphenolic materials.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by severe movement defects and the degeneration of dopaminergic neurones in the midbrain. The symptoms of PD can be managed with dopamine replacement therapy using L-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa), which is the gold standard therapy for PD. However, long-term treatment with L-dopa can lead to motor complications. The central renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases in the brain. However, the role of the RAS in dopamine replacement therapy for PD remains unclear. Here, we tested the co-treatment of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) with L-dopa altered L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned mouse model of PD. Perindopril, captopril, and enalapril were used as ACEIs. The co-treatment of ACEI with L-dopa significantly decreased LID development in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice. In addition, the astrocyte and microglial transcripts involving Ccl2, C3, Cd44, and Iigp1 were reduced by co-treatment with ACEI and L-dopa in the 6-OHDA-lesioned striatum. In conclusion, co-treatment with ACEIs and L-dopa, such as perindopril, captopril, and enalapril, may mitigate the severity of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in a mouse model of PD.",

However, limited information exists regarding Mucuna laticifera, a newly identified species within the Mucuna genus. This study unveils a remarkable L-dopa content of 174.3 mg/g in M. laticifera seeds, surpassing all previously documented Mucuna species. Moreover, this research marks the first documentation of L-dopa, flavonoids, and phenolics within M. laticifera seeds. Furthermore, the aqueous extract derived from these seeds exhibits robust antioxidant properties. Investigation into its anti-inflammatory potential reveals a significant reduction in paw swelling and neutrophil infiltration at inflammatory sites in a carrageenan-induced rat model. Gene expression analysis utilizing a rat paw model demonstrates that the seed extract significantly downregulates the expression of various inflammation-related genes compared to carrageenan-treated rats. Collectively, these findings clearly substantiate the anti-inflammatory activity of M. laticifera seed extract. The exceptional L-dopa content combined with its anti-inflammatory properties position M. laticifera seeds as a promising therapeutic option for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's, as well as various inflammatory conditions.

      "abstract": "We tested the efficacy of 4'-fluorocannabidiol (4'-F-CBD), a semisynthetic cannabidiol derivative, and HU-910, a cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) agonist in resolving l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). Specifically, we were interested in studying whether these compounds could restrain striatal inflammatory responses and rescue glutamatergic disturbances characteristic of the dyskinetic state. C57BL/6 mice were rendered hemiparkinsonian by unilateral striatal lesioning with 6-OHDA. Abnormal involuntary movements were then induced by repeated i.p. injections of l-DOPA + benserazide. After LID was installed, the effects of a 3-day treatment with 4'-F-CBD or HU-910 in combination or not with the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine (CPZ) or CB2 agonists HU-308 and JWH015 were assessed. Immunostaining was conducted to investigate the impacts of 4'-F-CBD and HU-910 (with CPZ) on inflammation and glutamatergic synapses. Our results showed that the combination of 4'-F-CBD + CPZ, but not when administered alone, decreased LID. Neither HU-910 alone nor HU-910+CPZ were effective. The CB2 agonists HU-308 and JWH015 were also ineffective in decreasing LID. Both combination treatments efficiently reduced microglial and astrocyte activation in the dorsal striatum of dyskinetic mice. However, only 4'-F-CBD + CPZ normalized the density of glutamate vesicular transporter-1 (vGluT1) puncta colocalized with the postsynaptic density marker PSD95. These findings suggest that 4'-F-CBD + CPZ normalizes dysregulated cortico-striatal glutamatergic inputs, which could be involved in their anti-dyskinetic effects. Although it is not possible to rule out the involvement of anti-inflammatory mechanisms, the decrease in striatal neuroinflammation markers by 4'-F-CBD and HU-910 without an associated reduction in LID indicates that they are insufficient per se to prevent LID manifestations.",

      "abstract": "l-DOPA plays a critical role as a precursor to dopamine and is a standard treatment for Parkinson's disease. Recent research has highlighted the potential therapeutic advantages of deuterated l-DOPA analogs having a longer biological half-life. For their spectroscopic characterization, the in-detail characterization of l-DOPA itself is necessary. This article presents a thorough examination of the vibrational spectra of l-DOPA, with a particular emphasis on chirally sensitive VOA techniques. We successfully obtained high-quality Raman and ROA spectra of l-DOPA in its cationic form, under low pH conditions, and at a high concentration of 100 mg/ml. These spectra cover a broad spectral range, allowing for precise comparisons with theoretical simulations. We also obtained IR and VCD spectra, but they faced limitations due to the narrow accessible spectral region. Exploration of l-DOPA's conformational landscape revealed its intrinsic flexibility, with multiple coexisting conformations. To characterize these conformations, we employed two methods: one involved potential energy surface scans with implicit solvation, and the other utilized molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvation. Comparing ROA spectra from different conformer groups and applying spectral decomposition proved crucial in determining the correct conformer ratios. The use of explicit solvation significantly improved the quality of the final simulated spectral profiles. The accurate determination of conformer ratios, rather than solely relying on the number of averaged spectra, played a crucial role in simulation accuracy. In conclusion, our study offers valuable insights into the structure and conformational behavior of l-DOPA and represents a valuable resource for subsequent spectroscopic studies of its deuterated analogs.",

      "abstract": "Repurposing regulatory agency-approved molecules, with proven safety in humans, is an attractive option for developing new treatments for disease. We identified and assessed the efficacy of 3 drugs predicted by an in silico screen as having the potential to treat l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson's disease. We analysed ∼1.3 million Medline abstracts using natural language processing and ranked 3539 existing drugs based on predicted ability to reduce LID. 3 drugs from the top 5% of the 3539 candidates; lorcaserin, acamprosate and ganaxolone, were prioritized for preclinical testing based on i) having a novel mechanism of action, ii) having not been previously validated for the treatment of LID, iii) being blood-brain-barrier penetrant and orally bioavailable and iv) being clinical trial ready. We assessed the efficacy of acamprosate, ganaxolone and lorcaserin in a rodent model of l-DOPA-induced hyperactivity, with lorcaserin affording a 58% reduction in rotational asymmetry (P < 0.05) compared to vehicle. Acamprosate and ganaxolone failed to demonstrate efficacy. Lorcaserin, a 5HT2C agonist, was then further tested in MPTP lesioned dyskinetic macaques where it afforded an 82% reduction in LID (P < 0.05), unfortunately accompanied by a significant increase in parkinsonian disability. In conclusion, although our data do not support the repurposing of lorcaserin, acamprosate or ganaxolone per se for LID, we demonstrate value of an in silico approach to identify candidate molecules which, in combination with an in vivo screen, can facilitate clinical development decisions. The present study adds to a growing literature in support of this paradigm shifting approach in the repurposing pipeline.",

      "abstract": "A common adverse effect of Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment is L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). This condition results from both dopamine (DA)-dependent and DA-independent mechanisms, as glutamate inputs from corticostriatal projection neurons impact DA-responsive medium spiny neurons in the striatum to cause the dyskinetic behaviors. In this study, we explored whether suppression of presynaptic corticostriatal glutamate inputs might affect the behavioral and biochemical outcomes associated with LID. We first established an animal model in which 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned mice were treated daily with L-dopa (10 mg/kg, i.p.) for 2 weeks; these mice developed stereotypical abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs). When the mice were pretreated with the NMDA antagonist, amantadine, we observed suppression of AIMs and reductions of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and NR2B in the striatum. We then took an optogenetic approach to manipulate glutamatergic activity. Slc17a6 (vGluT2)-Cre mice were injected with pAAV5-Ef1a-DIO-eNpHR3.0-mCherry and received optic fiber implants in either the M1 motor cortex or dorsolateral striatum. Optogenetic inactivation at either optic fiber implant location could successfully reduce the intensity of AIMs after 6-OHDA lesioning and L-dopa treatment. Both optical manipulation strategies also suppressed phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-NR2B signals in the striatum. Finally, we performed intrastriatal injections of LDN 212320 in the dyskenesic mice to enhance expression of glutamate uptake transporter GLT-1. Sixteen hours after the LDN 212320 treatment, L-dopa-induced AIMs were reduced along with the levels of striatal phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-NR2B. Together, our results affirm a critical role of corticostriatal glutamate neurons in LID and strongly suggest that diminishing synaptic glutamate, either by suppression of neuronal activity or by upregulation of GLT-1, could be an effective approach for managing LID.",

      "abstract": "Dopamine neurons play crucial roles in pleasure, reward, memory, learning, and fine motor skills and their dysfunction is associated with various neuropsychiatric diseases. Dopamine receptors are the main target of treatment for neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Antipsychotics that antagonize the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) are used to alleviate the symptoms of these disorders but may also sometimes cause disabling side effects such as parkinsonism (catalepsy in rodents). Here we show that GPR143, a G-protein-coupled receptor for L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), expressed in striatal cholinergic interneurons enhances the DRD2-mediated side effects of haloperidol, an antipsychotic agent. Haloperidol-induced catalepsy was attenuated in male Gpr143 gene-deficient (Gpr143-/y ) mice compared with wild-type (Wt) mice. Reducing the endogenous release of L-DOPA and preventing interactions between GPR143 and DRD2 suppressed the haloperidol-induced catalepsy in Wt mice but not Gpr143-/y mice. The phenotypic defect in Gpr143-/y mice was mimicked in cholinergic interneuron-specific Gpr143-/y (Chat-cre;Gpr143flox/y ) mice. Administration of haloperidol increased the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 at Ser240/244 in the dorsolateral striatum of Wt mice but not Chat-cre;Gpr143flox/y mice. In Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing DRD2, co-expression of GPR143 increased cell surface expression level of DRD2, and L-DOPA application further enhanced the DRD2 surface expression. Shorter pauses in cholinergic interneuron firing activity were observed after intrastriatal stimulation in striatal slice preparations from Chat-cre;Gpr143flox/y mice compared with those from Wt mice. Together, these findings provide evidence that GPR143 regulates DRD2 function in cholinergic interneurons and may be involved in parkinsonism induced by antipsychotic drugs.",

      "abstract": "L-DOPA, the gold standard for managing Parkinson's disease (PD) is fraught by motor fluctuations termed L-Dopa-Induced Dyskinesia (LID). LID has very few therapeutic options. Hence, the need for preclinical screening of new interventions. Cholecalciferol (VD3) treatment reportedly improves motor deficit in experimental Parkinsonism. Therefore, the novel anti-dyskinetic effect of VD3 and its underlying mechanisms in LID was investigated. Dyskinesia was induced by chronic L-DOPA administration in parkinsonian (6-OHDA- lesioned) mice. The experimental groups: Control, Dyskinesia, Dyskinesia/VD3, and Dyskinesia/Amantadine were challenged with L-DOPA to determine the abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) score during 14 days of VD3 (30 mg/kg) or Amantadine (40 mg/kg) treatment. Behavioral Axial, Limb & Orolingual (ALO) AIMs were scored for 1 min at every 20 mins interval, over a duration of 100 mins on days 1,3,7,11 and 14. Using western blot, striatum was assessed for expression of dopamine metabolic enzymes: Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) and Monoamine Oxidase-B (MAO-B); CD11b, BAX, P47phox, and IL-1β. Cholecalciferol significantly attenuated AIMs only on days 11 & 14 with maximal reduction of 32.7%. Expression of TH and MAO-B was not altered in VD3 compared with dyskinetic mice. VD3 significantly inhibited oxidative stress (P47phox), apoptosis (BAX), inflammation (IL-1β) and microglial activation (CD11b). VD3 showed anti-dyskinetic effects behaviorally by attenuating abnormal involuntary movements, modulation of striatal oxidative stress, microglial responses, inflammation, and apoptotic signaling; without affecting dopamine metabolic enzymes. Its use in the management of dyskinesia is promising. More studies are required to further evaluate these findings.

The aim of this study was to assess the therapeutic effects of dual dopaminergic modulation (DDM) with l-DOPA and chlorpromazine (CPZ) in patients with idiopathic cervical dystonia (CD). METHODS: We enrolled 21 patients with CD who responded poorly to botulinum toxin treatment. The severities of CD motor symptoms and CD-associated pain were determined using the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale and the visual analog scale, respectively. RESULTS: In patients with CD (n = 7), oral administration of l-DOPA combined with CPZ significantly attenuated both CD motor symptoms and CD-associated pain in a dose-related manner. By contrast, there was no improvement of CD symptoms in patients (n = 7) who ingested l-DOPA alone nor in those (n = 7) who ingested CPZ alone. DISCUSSION: DDM with l-DOPA and CPZ may be an effective tool to treat dystonia symptoms in patients with botulinum toxin-resistant idiopathic CD. Our results may also indicate that CD dystonia symptoms could be attenuated through DDM inducing an increase in striosomal D1-signaling. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that treatment of botulinum toxin-resistant idiopathic cervical dystonia with l-DOPA and chlorpromazine is superior to either one alone."

METHOD: In 226 male GTS patients (5-14 years), we followed vocal and motor tics and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) after discontinuing blockers at the first visit starting with low-dose L-Dopa. We recorded visual- (VGS) and memory-guided saccades (MGS) in 110 patients and 26 normal participants. RESULTS: At the first visit, prior blocker users exhibited more severe vocal tics and OCD, but not motor tics, which persisted during follow-up. Patients treated with L-Dopa showed greater improvement of motor tics, but not vocal tics and OCD. Patients with and without blocker use showed similarly impaired MGS performance, while patients with blocker use showed more prominently impaired inhibitory control of saccades, associated with vocal tics and OCD. DISCUSSION: Impaired MGS performance suggested a mild hypodopaminergic state causing reduced direct pathway activity in the (oculo-)motor loops of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit. Blocker use may aggravate vocal tics and OCD due to disinhibition within the associative and limbic loops. The findings provide a rationale for discouraging blocker use and using low-dose L-Dopa in GTS."

The importance of oxidative stress has been demonstrated in several human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. L-Dopa decarboxylase (DDC) is the enzyme that converts L-Dopa to dopamine (DA). In spite of a large number of studies, little is known about the biological significance of the enzyme under physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we investigated the relationship between DDC expression and oxidative stress in human neural and non-neural cells. Oxidative stress was induced by treatment with H2O2. Our data indicated that mRNA and protein expression of DDC was enhanced or remained stable under conditions of ROS induction, despite degradation of total RNA and increased cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Moreover, DDC silencing caused an increase in the H2O2-induced cytotoxicity. The current study suggests that DDC is involved in the mechanisms of oxidative stress."

      "abstract": "A large body of work during the past several decades has been focused on therapeutic strategies to control L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LIDs), common motor complications of long-term L-DOPA therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD). Yet, LIDs remain a clinical challenge for the management of patients with advanced disease. Glutamatergic dysregulation of striatal projection neurons (SPNs) appears to be a key contributor to altered motor responses to L-DOPA. Targeting striatal hyperactivity at the glutamatergic neurotransmission level led to significant preclinical and clinical trials of a variety of antiglutamatergic agents. In fact, the only FDA-approved treatment for LIDs is amantadine, a drug with NMDAR antagonistic actions. Still, novel agents with improved pharmacological profiles are needed for LID therapy. Recently other therapeutic targets to reduce dysregulated SPN activity at the signal transduction level have emerged. In particular, mechanisms regulating the levels of cyclic nucleotides play a major role in the transduction of dopamine signals in SPNs. The phosphodiesterases (PDEs), a large family of enzymes that degrade cyclic nucleotides in a specific manner, are of special interest. We will review the research for antiglutamatergic and PDE inhibition strategies in view of the future development of novel LID therapies.",

      "abstract": "L-DOPA is the mainstay of treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, over time this drug can produce dyskinesia. A useful acute PD model for screening novel compounds for anti-parkinsonian and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) are dopamine-depleted dopamine-transporter KO (DDD) mice. Treatment with α-methyl-para-tyrosine rapidly depletes their brain stores of DA and renders them akinetic. During sensitization in the open field (OF), their locomotion declines as vertical activities increase and upon encountering a wall they stand on one leg or tail and engage in climbing behavior termed \"three-paw dyskinesia\". We have hypothesized that L-DOPA induces a stereotypic activation of locomotion in DDD mice, where they are unable to alter the course of their locomotion, and upon encountering walls engage in \"three-paw dyskinesia\" as reflected in vertical counts or beam-breaks. The purpose of our studies was to identify a valid index of LID in DDD mice that met three criteria: (a) sensitization with repeated L-DOPA administration, (b) insensitivity to a change in the test context, and (c) stimulatory or inhibitory responses to dopamine D1 receptor agonists (5 mg/kg SKF81297; 5 and 10 mg/kg MLM55-38, a novel compound) and amantadine (45 mg/kg), respectively. Responses were compared between the OF and a circular maze (CM) that did not hinder locomotion. We found vertical counts and climbing were specific for testing in the OF, while oral stereotypies were sensitized to L-DOPA in both the OF and CM and responded to D1R agonists and amantadine. Hence, in DDD mice oral stereotypies should be used as an index of LID in screening compounds for PD.",

Development of an efficient method for the production of L-DOPA is urgently required. Nanozymes emulating tyrosine hydroxylase have attracted enormous attention for biomimetic synthesis of L-DOPA, but suffered from heterogeneity. Herein, a spherical porous iron-nitrogen-carbon nanozyme was developed for production of L-DOPA. Tannic acid chelated with ferrous ions to form a tannin-iron coordination framework as a carbon precursor. Iron and nitrogen co-doped carbon nanospheres were assembled via an evaporation-induced self-assembly process using urea as a nitrogen source, F127 as a soft template, and formaldehyde as a crosslinker. The nanozyme was obtained after carbonization and acid etching. The nanozyme possessed a dispersive iron atom anchored in the Fe-N coordination structure as an active site to mimic the active center of tyrosine hydroxylase. The material showed spherical morphology, uniform size, high specific surface area, a mesoporous structure and easy magnetic separation. The structural properties could promote the density and accessibility of active sites and facilitate mass transport and electron transfer. The nanozyme exhibited high activity to catalyze the hydroxylation of tyrosine to L-DOPA as tyrosine hydroxylase in the presence of ascorbic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The titer of DOPA reached 1.2 mM. The nanozyme showed good reusability and comparable enzyme kinetics to tyrosine hydroxylase with a Michaelis-Menten constant of 2.3 mM. The major active species was the hydroxyl radical. Biomimetic simulation of tyrosine hydroxylase using a nanozyme with a fine structure provided a new route for the efficient production of L-DOPA.",

      "abstract": "L-Dopa, while treating motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, can lead to debilitating L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias, limiting its use. To investigate the causative relationship between neuro-inflammation and dyskinesias, we assessed if striatal M1 and M2 microglia numbers correlated with dyskinesia severity and whether the anti-inflammatories, minocycline and indomethacin, reverse these numbers and mitigate against dyskinesia. In 6-OHDA lesioned mice, we used stereology to assess numbers of striatal M1 and M2 microglia populations in non-lesioned (naïve) and lesioned mice that either received no L-Dopa (PD), remained non-dyskinetic even after L-Dopa (non-LID) or became dyskinetic after L-Dopa treatment (LID). We also assessed the effect of minocycline/indomethacin treatment on striatal M1 and M2 microglia and its anti-dyskinetic potential via AIMs scoring. We report that L-Dopa treatment leading to LIDs exacerbates activated microglia numbers beyond that associated with the PD state; the severity of LIDs is strongly correlated to the ratio of the striatal M1 to M2 microglial numbers; in non-dyskinetic mice, there is no M1/M2 microglia ratio increase above that seen in PD mice; and reducing M1/M2 microglia ratio using anti-inflammatories is anti-dyskinetic. Parkinson's disease is associated with increased inflammation, but this is insufficient to underpin dyskinesia. Given that L-Dopa-treated non-LID mice show the same ratio of M1/M2 microglia as PD mice that received no L-Dopa, and, given minocycline/indomethacin reduces both the ratio of M1/M2 microglia and dyskinesia severity, our data suggest the increased microglial M1/M2 ratio that occurs following L-Dopa treatment is a contributing cause of dyskinesias.",

It has been posited that the effect could be due to paracetamol and its metabolite, NAPQI, inhibiting pain signals in the spinal column. In this work, we examine the possibility that the therapeutic effect of the paracetamol for the Parkinson's disease patient may be due to an inhibition of the enzymes that metabolize dopamine and/or l-DOPA, thus effectively extending the lifetime of the l-DOPA treatment. In this work, we use the M062X/6-311+G* level of theory to calculate the electronic binding energies (including explicit desolvation) of several ligands (paracetamol, NAPQI, dopamine, and l-DOPA) with a series of enzymes important to the production and metabolism of dopamine and compare them to calculated binding energy values for the natural substrates for those enzymes in order to predict possible inhibition. Benchmark interaction energies for a subset of the systems studied are calculated using the more accurate second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) method in order to calibrate the accuracy of the M062X method. If we assume that the interaction energies calculated here can serve as a proxy for in vivo inhibition, then we can predict that paracetamol and NAPQI should not inhibit the natural production of dopamine and may in fact inhibit the metabolism of l-DOPA and dopamine, thus extending the length of l-DOPA treatments."

In Parkinson's disease (PD), dopamine replacement using the precursor drug L-DOPA is the predominant treatment approach, but long-term exposure leads to the onset of dyskinesias (LIDs). Chronic L-DOPA exposure has been associated with changes in gene expression and altered cortico-striatal plasticity. The aim of this research was to assess the functional consequence of long-term L-DOPA exposure on cognitive and motor function using a rodent model of PD. Across two independent experiments, we assessed the impact of chronic L-DOPA exposure, or a control D2R agonist, on motor and cognitive function in intact and in hemi parkinsonian rats, in the absence of drug. Abnormal involuntary movements associated with LID were measured and brain tissues were subsequently harvested for immunohistochemical analysis. Exposure to chronic L-DOPA, but not the D2R agonist, impaired motor and cognitive function, when animals were tested in the absence of drug. A meta-analysis of the two experiments allowed further dissociation of L-DOPA -treated rats into those that developed LIDs (dyskinetic) and those that did not develop LIDs (non-dyskinetic). This analysis revealed impaired cognitive and motor performance were evident only in dyskinetic, but not in non-dyskinetic, rats. These data reveal a functional consequence of the altered plasticity associated with LID onset and have implications for understanding symptom progression in the clinic.",

      "abstract": "L-DOPA is deficient in the developing albino eye, resulting in abnormalities of retinal development and visual impairment. Ongoing retinal development after birth has also been demonstrated in the developing albino eye offering a potential therapeutic window in humans. To study whether human equivalent doses of L-DOPA/Carbidopa administered during the crucial postnatal period of neuroplasticity can rescue visual function, OCA C57BL/6 J-c2J OCA1 mice were treated with a 28-day course of oral L-DOPA/Carbidopa at 3 different doses from 15 to 43 days postnatal age (PNA) and for 3 different lengths of treatment, to identify optimum dosage and treatment length. Visual electrophysiology, acuity, and retinal morphology were measured at 4, 5, 6, 12 and 16 weeks PNA and compared to untreated C57BL/6 J (WT) and OCA1 mice. Quantification of PEDF, βIII-tubulin and syntaxin-3 expression was also performed. Our data showed impaired retinal morphology, decreased retinal function and lower visual acuity in untreated OCA1 mice compared to WT mice. These changes were diminished or eliminated when treated with higher doses of L-DOPA/Carbidopa. Our results demonstrate that oral L-DOPA/Carbidopa supplementation at human equivalent doses during the postnatal critical period of retinal neuroplasticity can rescue visual retinal morphology and retinal function, via PEDF upregulation and modulation of retinal synaptogenesis, providing a further step towards developing an effective treatment for albinism patients.",

Its depletion resulted in characteristic symptoms in experimental studies and could be antagonized by DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanin), suggesting a similarity to the human disorder Parkinson´s disease (PD) and a therapeutic potential which was successfully exploited from the 1970s on. This was due to the pioneering work of Arvid Carlsson and clinicians around the world who first worked on the breakthrough of L-DOPA therapy and then on its amendment and modification and on alternative therapies for PD patients. All these developments led to the establishment of PD therapy as we know it today. It is characterized by the availability of many different compounds which are mostly employed in combination and by different methods: orally, intravenously, transdermally, subcutaneously, or duodenally. Here, we present without claim of completeness some personal reflections about causal drug developments for PD patients and reflect on some personal interactions with leading clinicians and basic researchers who cooperated with us. Such interactions are crucial for the creation, sometimes serendipitously, of fresh ideas and to further develop existing concepts to make therapeutical progress.",

      "abstract": "Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu2/3 receptors) have been regarded as promising candidates for the treatment of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID); however, confirmation is still lacking. As the hub of the basal ganglia circuit, the striatum plays a critical role in action control. Supersensitive responsiveness of glutamatergic corticostriatal input may be the key mechanism for the development of LID. In this study, we first examined the potency of LY354740 (12 mg/kg, i.p.) in modulating glutamate and dopamine release in lesioned striatum of stable LID rats. Then, we injected LY354740 (20nmoL or 40nmoL in 4 μL of sterile 0.9 % saline) directly into the lesioned striatum to verify its ability to reduce or attenuate L-DOPA-induced abnormal involuntary movements. In experiment conducted in established LID rats, after continuous injection for 4 days, we found that LY354740 significantly reduced the expression of dyskinesia. In another experiment conducted in parkinsonism rat models, we found that LY354740 attenuated the development of LID with an inverted-U dose-response curve. The role of LY354740 in modulating striatal expressions of LID-related molecular changes was also assessed after these behavioral experiments. We found that LY354740 significantly inhibited abnormal expressions of p-Fyn/p-NMDA/p-ERK1/2/p-HistoneH3/ΔFosB, which is in line with its ability to alleviate abnormal involuntary movements in both LID expression and induction phase. Our study indicates that activation of striatal mGlu2/3 receptors can attenuate the development of dyskinesia in parkinsonism rats and provide some functional improvements in LID rats by inhibiting LID-related molecular changes.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The leading treatment for motor signs of Parkinson's disease is L-DOPA, but, upon extended use, it can lead to levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). Serotonergic neurons are involved in LID etiology and previous pre-clinical studies have shown that NLX-112, a 5-HT1A biased agonist, has robust antidyskinetic effects. Here, we investigated its effects in hemiparkinsonian (HPK) rats with a unilateral nigrostriatal 6-OHDA lesion. METHODS: We compared HPK rats with LID (i.e., sensitized to the dyskinetic effects of chronic L-DOPA) and without LID (HPK-non-LID), using [18F]FDG PET imaging and fMRI functional connectivity following systemic treatment with saline, L-DOPA, NLX-112 or L-DOPA + NLX-112. RESULTS: In HPK-non-LID rats, [18F]FDG PET experiments showed that L-DOPA led to hypermetabolism in motor areas (cerebellum, brainstem, and mesencephalic locomotor region) and to hypometabolism in cortical regions. L-DOPA effects were also observed in HPK-LID rats, with the additional emergence of hypermetabolism in raphe nuclei and hypometabolism in hippocampus and striatum. NLX-112 attenuated L-DOPA-induced raphe hypermetabolism and cingulate cortex hypometabolism in HPK-LID rats. Moreover, in fMRI experiments NLX-112 partially corrected the altered neural circuit connectivity profile in HPK-LID rats, through activity in regions rich in 5-HT1A receptors. CONCLUSION: This neuroimaging study sheds light for the first time on the brain activation patterns of HPK-LID rats. The 5-HT1A receptor agonist, NLX-112, prevents occurrence of LID, likely by activating pre-synaptic autoreceptors in the raphe nuclei, resulting in a partial restoration of brain metabolic and connectivity profiles. In addition, NLX-112 also rescues L-DOPA-induced deficits in cortical activation, suggesting potential benefit against non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.",

To unveil previously undiscovered metabolites of Coffea, of phytotherapeutic and economic value, we employed 24 RNAseq libraries. These libraries were sequenced from leaves exposed to a diverse range of environmental conditions. Subsequently, the data were meticulously processed to create models of putative metabolic networks, which shed light on the production of potential natural compounds of significant interest. Then, we selected one of the predicted compounds, the L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), to be analyzed by LC-MS/MS using three biological replicates of flowers, leaves, and fruits from Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora. We were able to identify metabolic pathways responsible for producing several compounds of economic importance. One of the identified pathways involved in isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis was found to be active and producing L-DOPA, which is a common product of POLYPHENOL OXIDASES (PPOs, EC 1.14.18.1 and EC 1.10.3.1). We show that coffee plants are a natural source of L-DOPA, a widely used medicine for treatment of the human neurodegenerative condition called Parkinson's disease. In addition, dozens of other compounds with medicinal significance were predicted as potential natural coffee products. By further refining analytical chemistry techniques, it will be possible to enhance the characterization of coffee metabolites, enabling a deeper understanding of their properties and potential applications in medicine."

Here, we compare the effects of L-DOPA and ropinirole, alone or in combination, on patterns of glial and microvascular reactivity in the striatum. Rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions were treated with therapeutic-like doses of L-DOPA (6 mg/kg), an equipotent L-DOPA-ropinirole combination (L-DOPA 3 mg/kg plus ropinirole 0.5 mg/kg), or ropinirole alone. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the reactivity of microglia (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1, IBA-1) and astroglia (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP), as well as blood vessel density (rat endothelial cell antigen 1, RECA-1) and albumin extravasation. L-DOPA monotreatment and L-DOPA-ropinirole cotreatment induced moderate-severe dyskinesia, whereas ropinirole alone had negligible dyskinetic effects. Despite similar dyskinesia severity, striking differences in perivascular microglia and astroglial reactivity were found between animals treated with L-DOPA vs. L-DOPA-ropinirole. The former exhibited a marked upregulation of perivascular IBA-1 cells (in part CD68-positive) and IBA-1-RECA-1 contact points, along with an increased microvessel density and strong perivascular GFAP expression. None of these markers were significantly upregulated in animals treated with L-DOPA-ropinirole or ropinirole alone. In summary, although ropinirole cotreatment does not prevent L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, it protects from maladaptive gliovascular changes otherwise associated with this disorder, with potential long-term benefits to striatal tissue homeostasis.",

However, the mechanisms responsible for the anti-LID effect are unclear. Changes in cholesterol homeostasis and oxidative stress- and inflammation-related mechanisms such as angiotensin II and Rho-kinase (ROCK) inhibition may be involved. The nigra and striatum of dyskinetic rats showed increased levels of cholesterol, ROCK, and the inflammatory marker IL-1β, which were reduced by the angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT1) antagonist candesartan, simvastatin, and the ROCK inhibitor fasudil. As observed for LID, angiotensin II-induced, via AT1, increased levels of cholesterol and ROCK in the rat nigra and striatum. In cultured dopaminergic neurons, angiotensin II increased cholesterol biosynthesis and cholesterol efflux without changes in cholesterol uptake. In astrocytes, angiotensin induced an increase in cholesterol uptake, decrease in biosynthesis, and no change in cholesterol efflux, suggesting a neuronal accumulation of cholesterol that is reduced via transfer to astrocytes. Our data suggest mutual interactions between angiotensin/AT1, cholesterol, and ROCK pathways in LID, which are attenuated by the corresponding inhibitors. Interestingly, these three drugs have also been suggested as neuroprotective treatments against Parkinson's disease. Therefore, they may reduce dyskinesia and the progression of the disease using common mechanisms."

Understanding the mechanisms underlying the development of these motor disorders is needed to reduce or prevent them. We investigated the role of TrkB receptor in LID, in hemiparkinsonian mice treated by chronic L-DOPA administration. Repeated L-DOPA treatment for 10 days specifically increased full-length TrkB receptor mRNA and protein levels in the dopamine-depleted dorsal striatum (DS) compared to the contralateral non-lesioned DS or to the DS of sham-operated animals. Dopamine depletion alone or acute L-DOPA treatment did not significantly increase TrkB protein levels. In addition to increasing TrkB protein levels, chronic L-DOPA treatment activated the TrkB receptor as evidenced by its increased tyrosine phosphorylation. Using specific agonists for the D1 or D2 receptors, we found that TrkB increase is D1 receptor-dependent. To determine the consequences of these effects, the TrkB gene was selectively deleted in striatal neurons expressing the D1 receptor. Mice with TrkB floxed gene were injected with Cre-expressing adeno-associated viruses or crossed with Drd1-Cre transgenic mice. After unilateral lesion of dopamine neurons in these mice, we found an aggravation of axial LID compared to the control groups. In contrast, no change was found when TrkB deletion was induced in the indirect pathway D2 receptor-expressing neurons. Our study suggests that BDNF/TrkB signaling plays a protective role against the development of LID and that agonists specifically activating TrkB could reduce the severity of LID.",

During disease progression, fluctuations in L-DOPA plasma levels occur, causing motor complications. Sensing devices capable of rapidly monitoring drug levels would allow adjusting L-Dopa dosing, improving therapeutic outcomes. A novel amperometric biosensor for L-Dopa detection is described, based on tyrosinase co-crosslinked onto a graphene oxide layer produced through electrodeposition. Careful optimization of the enzyme immobilization procedure permitted to improve the long-term stability while substantially shortening and simplifying the biosensor fabrication. The effectiveness of the immobilization protocol combined with the enhanced performances of electrodeposited graphene oxide allowed to achieve high sensitivity, wide linear range, and a detection limit of 0.84 μM, suitable for L-Dopa detection within its therapeutic window. Interference from endogenous compounds, tested at concentrations levels typically found in drug-treated patients, was not significant. Ascorbic acid exhibited a tyrosinase inhibitory behavior and was therefore rejected from the enzymatic layer by casting an outer Nafion membrane. The proposed device was applied for L-Dopa detection in human plasma, showing good recoveries.",

However, it has also shown its beneficial effects on Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. Recent clinical studies have suggested that ZNS can also have beneficial effects on L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID), which is a major side effect of long-term L-DOPA treatments for PD. In the present study, we examined the behavioral effects of ZNS on LID in PD model mice. Acute ZNS treatment did not have any observable behavioral effects on LID. Contrastingly, chronic ZNS treatment with L-DOPA delayed the peak of LID and reduced the severity of LID before the peak but increased the duration of LID in a dose-dependent manner of ZNS compared to PD model mice treated with L-DOPA alone. Thus, ZNS appears to have both beneficial and adverse effects on LID."

      "abstract": "Temozolomide is used commonly in the treatment of some types of cancers, but it may also result in cognitive impairments such as memory deficits. l -Dopa, a well known medicine for the central nervous system, has been shown to have positive effects on some cognitive disorders. Here we sought to investigate the effect of l -Dopa on temozolomide-induced cognitive impairments. BALB/c mice were subjected to 3-days temozolomide and 6-days concomitant l -Dopa/benserazide administration in six groups (control, l -Dopa 25 mg/kg, l -Dopa 75 mg/kg, temozolomide, temozolomide +  l -Dopa 25 mg/kg, and temozolomide +  l -Dopa 75 mg/kg). Open field test, object location recognition, novel object recognition test, and shuttle-box test were carried out to determine the locomotor, anxiety-like behavior, and memory function of subjects. TNF-α and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene expression in the hippocampus was measured by real-time PCR. Mice treated with temozolomide showed recognition memory impairment, along with hippocampal TNF-α and BDNF mRNA expression level raise, and detection of histological insults in hematoxylin and eosin hippocampal slides. Mice that received temozolomide +  l -Dopa showed normal behavioral function and lower TNF-α and BDNF hippocampal mRNA expression levels, and histologically normal hippocampal CA1 region in comparison with mice in the temozolomide group. Our results provide evidence that l -Dopa prevents temozolomide-induced recognition memory deficit in mice at the acute phase probably via l -Dopa antineuroinflammatory effects.",

We set out to compare temporal and topographic profiles of abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) after l-DOPA dose challenges including or not the dopamine agonist ropinirole. Twenty-five patients with PD and a history of dyskinesias were sequentially administered either l-DOPA alone (150% of usual morning dose) or an equipotent combination of l-DOPA and ropinirole in random order. Involuntary movements were assessed by two blinded raters prior and every 30 min after drug dosing using the Clinical Dyskinesia Rating Scale (CDRS). A sensor-recording smartphone was secured to the patients' abdomen during the test sessions. The two raters' CDRS scores were highly reliable and concordant with models of hyperkinesia presence and severity trained on accelerometer data. The dyskinesia time curves differed between treatments as the l-DOPA-ropinirole combination resulted in lower peak severity but longer duration of the AIMs compared with l-DOPA alone. At the peak of the AIMs curve (60-120 min), l-DOPA induced a significantly higher total hyperkinesia score, whereas in the end phase (240-270 min), both hyperkinesia and dystonia tended to be more severe after the l-DOPA-ropinirole combination (though reaching statistical significance only for the item, arm dystonia). Our results pave the way for the introduction of a combined l-DOPA-ropinirole challenge test in the early clinical evaluation of antidyskinetic treatments. Furthermore, we propose a machine-learning method to predict CDRS hyperkinesia severity using accelerometer data.",

We examined the effects of combination of KW-6356 with L-DOPA in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated common marmosets. Oral administration of KW-6356 (1 mg/kg) enhanced the anti-parkinsonian activities of various doses of L-DOPA (2.5-10 mg/kg). In MPTP-treated common marmosets primed with L-DOPA to show dyskinesia, KW-6356 (1 mg/kg) also enhanced the anti-parkinsonian activities of various doses of L-DOPA (1.25-10 mg/kg) but not dyskinesia. Chronic co-administration of KW-6356 (1 mg/kg) with a low dose of L-DOPA (2.5 mg/kg) for 21 days increased the degree of dyskinesia induced by the low dose of L-DOPA, but the amplitude of dyskinesia induced by combined administration of KW-6356 (1 mg/kg) with L-DOPA (2.5 mg/kg) was lower than that induced by an optimal dose of L-DOPA (10 mg/kg).

However, pathological changes associated with the development of PD may also alter respiration and can lead to chronic episodes of hypoxia and hypercapnia. The mechanism behind impaired ventilation in PD is unclear. Therefore, in this study, we explore the hypercapnic ventilatory response in a reproducible reserpine-induced (RES) model of PD and parkinsonism. We also investigated how dopamine supplementation with L-DOPA, a classic drug used to treat PD, would affect the breathing and respiratory response to hypercapnia. Reserpine treatment resulted in decreased normocapnic ventilation and behavioral changes manifested as low physical activity and exploratory behavior. The respiratory rate and the minute ventilation response to hypercapnia were significantly higher in sham rats compared to the RES group, while the tidal volume response was lower. All of this appears to be due to reduced baseline ventilation values produced by reserpine. L-DOPA reversed reduced ventilation, indicating a stimulatory effect of DA on breathing, and showed the potency of DA supplementation in restoring normal respiratory activity."

Six Parkinsonian macaques were treated daily with L-DOPA for 3-4 months until they developed LIDs. Three animals were then co-treated with a single dose of 7-NI administered 45 min before each L-DOPA treatment. Dyskinetic MPTP-treated monkeys showed a significant decrease in LIDs compared with their scores without 7-NI treatment (p < 0.05). The anti-Parkinsonian effect of L-DOPA was similar in all three monkeys with and without 7-NI co-treatment. This improvement was significant with respect to the intensity and duration of LIDs while the beneficial effect of L-DOPA treatment was maintained and could represent a promising therapy to improve the quality of life of PD patients.",

      "abstract": "L-DOPA is the standard treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), but chronic treatment typically leads to L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). LID involves a complex interaction between the remaining dopamine (DA) system and the semi-homologous serotonin (5-HT) system. Since serotonin transporters (SERT) have some affinity for DA uptake, they may serve as a functional compensatory mechanism when DA transporters (DAT) are scant. DAT and SERT's functional contributions in the dyskinetic brain have not been well delineated. The current investigation sought to determine how DA depletion and L-DOPA treatment affect DAT and SERT transcriptional processes, translational processes, and functional DA uptake in the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned hemi-parkinsonian rat. Rats were counterbalanced for motor impairment into equally lesioned treatment groups then given daily L-DOPA (0 or 6 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. At the end of treatment, the substantia nigra was processed for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and DAT gene expression and dorsal raphe was processed for SERT gene expression. The striatum was processed for synaptosomal DAT and SERT protein expression and ex vivo DA uptake. Nigrostriatal DA loss severely reduced DAT mRNA and protein expression in the striatum with minimal changes in SERT. L-DOPA treatment, while not significantly affecting DAT or SERT alone, did increase striatal SERT:DAT protein ratios. Using ex vivo microdialysis, L-DOPA treatment increased DA uptake via SERT when DAT was depleted. Overall, these results suggest that DA loss and L-DOPA treatment uniquely alter DAT and SERT, revealing implications for monoamine transporters as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the hemi-parkinsonian model and dyskinetic PD patients.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a pervasive neurodegenerative disease, and levodopa (L-dopa) is its preferred treatment. The pathophysiological mechanism of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), the most common complication of long-term L-dopa administration, remains obscure. Accumulated evidence suggests that the dopaminergic as well as non-dopaminergic systems contribute to LID development. As a 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A/1B receptor agonist, eltoprazine ameliorates dyskinesia, although little is known about its electrophysiological mechanism. The aim of this study was to investigate the cumulative effects of chronic L-dopa administration and the potential mechanism of eltoprazine's amelioration of dyskinesia at the electrophysiological level in rats. METHODS: Neural electrophysiological analysis techniques were conducted on the acquired local field potential (LFP) data from primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) during different pathological states to obtain the information of power spectrum density, theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), and functional connectivity. Behavior tests and AIMs scoring were performed to verify PD model establishment and evaluate LID severity. RESULTS: We detected exaggerated gamma activities in the dyskinetic state, with different features and impacts in distinct regions. Gamma oscillations in M1 were narrowband manner, whereas that in DLS had a broadband appearance. Striatal exaggerated theta-gamma PAC in the LID state contributed to broadband gamma oscillation, and aperiodic-corrected cortical beta power correlated robustly with aperiodic-corrected gamma power in M1. M1-DLS coherence and phase-locking values (PLVs) in the gamma band were enhanced following L-dopa administration. Eltoprazine intervention reduced gamma oscillations, theta-gamma PAC in the DLS, and coherence and PLVs in the gamma band to alleviate dyskinesia. CONCLUSION: Excessive cortical gamma oscillation is a compelling clinical indicator of dyskinesia. The detection of enhanced PAC and functional connectivity of gamma-band oscillation can be used to guide and optimize deep brain stimulation parameters. Eltoprazine has potential clinical application for dyskinesia.",

A link between neuroinflammation and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia has been documented. Hydrogen gas (H2) has neuroprotective effects in Parkinson's disease models and has a major anti-inflammatory effect. Our objective is to test the hypothesis that H2 inhalation reduces L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. 15 days after 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of dopaminergic neurons were made (microinjection into the medial forebrain bundle), chronic L-DOPA treatment (15 days) was performed. Rats were exposed to H2 (2% gas mixture, 1 h) or air (controls) before L-DOPA injection. Abnormal involuntary movements and locomotor activity were conducted. Striatal microglia and astrocyte was analyzed and striatal and plasma samples for cytokines evaluation were collected after the abnormal involuntary movements analysis. H2 inhalation attenuated L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. The gas therapy did not impair the improvement of locomotor activity achieved by L-DOPA treatment. H2 inhalation reduced activated microglia in the lesioned striatum, which is consistent with the observed reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines levels. Display of abnormal involuntary movements was positively correlated with plasma IL-1β and striatal TNF-α levels and negatively correlated with striatal IL-10 levels. Prophylactic H2 inhalation decreases abnormal involuntary movements in a preclinical L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia model. The H2 antidyskinetic effect was associated with decreased striatal and peripheral inflammation. This finding has a translational importance to L-DOPA-treated parkinsonian patients' well-being."

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Dyskinesias induced by L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, L-Dopa (LIDs), are the major complication in the pharmacological treatment of Parkinson's disease. LIDs induce overactivity of the glutamatergic cortico-striatal projections, and drugs that reduce glutamatergic overactivity exert antidyskinetic actions. Chronic administration of immepip, agonist at histamine H3 receptors (H3R), reduces LIDs and diminishes GABA and glutamate content in striatal dialysates (Avila-Luna et al., Psychopharmacology 236: 1937-1948, 2019). OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: In rats unilaterally lesioned with 6-hydroxydopamine in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), we examined whether the chronic administration of immepip and their withdrawal modify LIDs, the effect of L-Dopa on glutamate and GABA content, and mRNA levels of dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs) and H3Rs in the cerebral cortex and striatum. RESULTS: The administration of L-Dopa for 21 days induced LIDs. This effect was accompanied by increased GABA and glutamate levels in the cerebral cortex ipsi and contralateral to the lesioned SNc, and immepip administration prevented (GABA) or reduced (glutamate) these actions. In the striatum, GABA content increased in the ipsilateral nucleus, an effect prevented by immepip. L-Dopa administration had no significant effects on striatal glutamate levels. In lesioned and L-Dopa-treated animals, D1R mRNA decreased in the ipsilateral striatum, an effect prevented by immepip administration. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that chronic H3R activation reduces LIDs and the overactivity of glutamatergic cortico-striatal projections, providing further evidence for an interaction between D1Rs and H3Rs in the cortex and striatum under normal and pathological conditions.",

Amantadine is beneficial for improving the motor symptoms, reducing \"off\" time, and ameliorating LID, although its long-term efficacy remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of amantadine on PD and LID using a rat model with repetitive drug treatment. METHOD: We utilized 6-hydroxydopamine injections to develop a hemiparkinsonian rat model. The rats were assigned to four groups: five rats received l-dopa and benserazide for 31 days, six rats received l-dopa and benserazide plus amantadine for 31 days, five rats received l-dopa and benserazide for 15 days followed by l-dopa and benserazide plus amantadine for 16 days, and five rats received l-dopa and benserazide plus amantadine for 15 days followed by l-dopa and benserazide treatment for 16 days. We evaluated the l-dopa-induced abnormal involuntary movements on treatment days 1, 7, 14, 16, 22, and 29. Subsequently, immunohistochemistry for drebrin was performed. RESULTS: l-dopa-induced abnormal movements were reduced on the first day of amantadine treatment, and these effects disappeared with repetitive treatment. In contrast, the extension of l-dopa \"on\" time was observed after repetitive amantadine treatment. All groups showed enlarged drebrin immunoreactive dots in the dopamine-denervated striatum, indicating that amantadine did not prevent priming effects of repetitive l-dopa treatment. CONCLUSION: Anti-LID effect of amantadine diminished after repetitive treatment, and the effect of amantadine on wearing-off emerged after repetitive treatment in a hemiparkinsonian rat model. Fluctuations in amantadine effects should be considered when using it in clinical settings.",

The potential contribution of striatal D2 receptor (D2R)-positive neurons and downstream circuits in the pathophysiology of LID remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of striatal D2R+ neurons and downstream globus pallidus externa (GPe) neurons in a rat model of LID. Intrastriatal administration of raclopride, a D2R antagonist, significantly inhibited dyskinetic behavior, while intrastriatal administration of pramipexole, a D2-like receptor agonist, yielded aggravation of dyskinesia in LID rats. Fiber photometry revealed the overinhibition of striatal D2R+ neurons and hyperactivity of downstream GPe neurons during the dyskinetic phase of LID rats. In contrast, the striatal D2R+ neurons showed intermittent synchronized overactivity in the decay phase of dyskinesia. Consistent with the above findings, optogenetic activation of striatal D2R+ neurons or their projections in the GPe was adequate to suppress most of the dyskinetic behaviors of LID rats. Our data demonstrate that the aberrant activity of striatal D2R+ neurons and downstream GPe neurons is a decisive mechanism mediating dyskinetic symptoms in LID rats.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms that result from loss of nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) cells. While L-DOPA provides symptom alleviation, its chronic use often results in the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). Evidence suggests that neuroplasticity within the serotonin (5-HT) system contributes to LID onset, persistence, and severity. This has been supported by research showing 5-HT compounds targeting 5-HT1A/1B receptors and/or the 5-HT transporter (SERT) can reduce LID. Recently, vortioxetine, a multimodal 5-HT compound developed for depression, demonstrated acute anti-dyskinetic effects. However, the durability and underlying pharmacology of vortioxetine's anti-dyskinetic actions have yet to be delineated. To address these gaps, we used hemiparkinsonian rats in Experiment 1, examining the effects of sub-chronic vortioxetine on established LID and motor performance. In Experiment 2, we applied the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 or 5-HT1B antagonist SB-224289 in conjunction with L-DOPA and vortioxetine to determine the contributions of each receptor to vortioxetine's effects. The results revealed that vortioxetine consistently and dose-dependently attenuated LID while independently, 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors each partially reversed vortioxetine's effects. Such findings further support the promise of pharmacological strategies, such as vortioxetine, and indicate that broad 5-HT actions may provide durable responses without significant side effects.",

To investigate the effects of PT320 on the manifestation of dyskinesia in L-DOPA-primed mice, a clinically translatable biweekly PT320 dose was administered starting at either 5 or 17-weeks-old mice. The early treatment group was given L-DOPA starting at 20 weeks of age and longitudinally evaluated up to 22 weeks. The late treatment group was given L-DOPA starting at 28 weeks of age and longitudinally observed up to 29 weeks. To explore dopaminergic transmission, fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) was utilized to measure presynaptic dopamine (DA) dynamics in striatal slices following drug treatments. Early administration of PT320 significantly mitigated the severity L-DOPA-induced abnormal involuntary movements; PT320 particularly improved excessive numbers of standing as well as abnormal paw movements, while it did not affect L-DOPA-induced locomotor hyperactivity. In contrast, late administration of PT320 did not attenuate any L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia measurements. Moreover, early treatment with PT320 was shown to not only increase tonic and phasic release of DA in striatal slices in L-DOPA-naïve MitoPark mice, but also in L-DOPA-primed animals. Early treatment with PT320 ameliorated L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in MitoPark mice, which may be related to the progressive level of DA denervation in PD.",

      "abstract": "Growing preclinical and clinical evidence highlights neurosteroid pathway imbalances in Parkinson's Disease (PD) and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LIDs). We recently reported that 5α-reductase (5AR) inhibitors dampen dyskinesias in parkinsonian rats; however, unraveling which specific neurosteroid mediates this effect is critical to optimize a targeted therapy. Among the 5AR-related neurosteroids, striatal pregnenolone has been shown to be increased in response to 5AR blockade and decreased after 6-OHDA lesions in the rat PD model. Moreover, this neurosteroid rescued psychotic-like phenotypes by exerting marked antidopaminergic activity. In light of this evidence, we investigated whether pregnenolone might dampen the appearance of LIDs in parkinsonian drug-naïve rats. We tested 3 escalating doses of pregnenolone (6, 18, 36 mg/kg) in 6-OHDA-lesioned male rats and compared the behavioral, neurochemical, and molecular outcomes with those induced by the 5AR inhibitor dutasteride, as positive control. The results showed that pregnenolone dose-dependently countered LIDs without affecting L-DOPA-induced motor improvements. Post-mortem analyses revealed that pregnenolone significantly prevented the increase of validated striatal markers of dyskinesias, such as phospho-Thr-34 DARPP-32 and phospho-ERK1/2, as well as D1-D3 receptor co-immunoprecipitation in a fashion similar to dutasteride. Moreover, the antidyskinetic effect of pregnenolone was paralleled by reduced striatal levels of BDNF, a well-established factor associated with the development of LIDs. In support of a direct pregnenolone effect, LC/MS-MS analyses revealed that striatal pregnenolone levels strikingly increased after the exogenous administration, with no significant alterations in downstream metabolites. All these data suggest pregnenolone as a key player in the antidyskinetic properties of 5AR inhibitors and highlight this neurosteroid as an interesting novel tool to target LIDs in PD.",

      "abstract": "Levodopa (L-DOPA) is an essential drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Currently, L-DOPA can be produced by chemical synthesis and can also be found naturally in many herbs, especially Mucuna Pruriens (MP). According to clinical research, the MP extract containing L-DOPA for the treatment of Parkinson's disease could reduce side effects more than the synthetic one. Unfortunately, MP extracts can be easily degraded. Changes in physical and chemical properties such as the appearance (color, melt, solid lump) and the reduction of L-DOPA content in the extract were commonly observed. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an extraction procedure to stabilize the extract of L-DOPA. This study attempted to enhance the extraction process by modifying the traditional acidification approach using hydrochloric acid, citric acid, or ascorbic acid. According to the stability test results, using Phyllanthus emblica water (PEW) as a solvent improved the preservative properties more than other solvents. The color of the PEW-MP powder changed slightly after 12 months of accelerated storage, but the amount of L-DOPA remained the highest (73.55%). Moreover, L-DOPA was only detected in MP and PEW-MP, but not PEW alone (the HPTLC chromatogram at Rf 0.48 and the HPLC chromatogram at Rt 6.0 min). The chemical profiles of PEW and L-DOPA observed in the chromatograms indicated that they are independently separated. As a result, they can be applied to a quality control process. Therefore, PEW was proven to be a powerful solvent for L-DOPA herbal extract that could be readily used as a raw material for herbal products.",

A wet AMD cell model was created via CoCl2 treatment of ARPE-19 cells. The cytoprotective effects of L-DOPA in the model were determined using CCK-8, flow cytometry, TUNEL, qPCR, and ELISA assays. Subsequently, circRNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were used to screen differentially expressed circRNAs, which were overexpressed in ARPE-19 cells, to explore their role in wet AMD. The findings revealed that 200 μM CoCl2 treatment inhibited the cell viability and the production of tyrosinase, melanin, and pigment epithelium-derived growth factor but promoted apoptosis and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in ARPE-19 cells. Moreover, 20 μM L-DOPA exerted the best therapeutic effect on the model. qPCR showed that Hsa_circ_0018401 (circ-SGMS1) was significantly differentially expressed in each experimental group, which was consistent with the sequencing results. The overexpression of circ-SGMS1 in ARPE-19 cells reversed the effects of CoCl2. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that circ-SGMS1 was expressed more in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. qPCR assays indicated that circ-SGMS1 overexpression did not have a significant effect on the expressions of VEGFA and KDR but significantly reduced the expressions of HIF-1a and THBS1. Circ-SGMS1 is of immense significance in the AMD treatment mechanism of L-DOPA. Overexpression of circ-SGMS1 may alleviate wet AMD by inhibiting HIF-1a and THBS1 expression.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease associated psychosis (PDAP) is a prevalent non-motor symptom (NMS) that significantly erodes patients' and caregivers' quality of life yet remains vastly understudied. One potential source of PDAP in late-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) is the common dopamine (DA) replacement therapy for motor symptoms, Levodopa (L-DOPA). Given the high incidence of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) in later phases of PD, this study sought to characterize the relationship between PDAP and LID in a bilateral medial forebrain bundle 6-hydroxydopamine hydrobromide (6-OHDA) lesion rat model. To assess PDAP in this model, prepulse inhibition (PPI), a well-validated assay of sensorimotor gating, was employed. First, we tested whether a bilateral lesion alone or after chronic L-DOPA treatment was sufficient to induce PPI dysfunction. Rats were also monitored for LID development, using the abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) test, to examine PPI and LID associations. In experiment 2, Vilazodone (VZD), a serotonin transporter (SERT) blocker and 1A receptor (5-HT1A) partial agonist was administered to test its potential efficacy in reducing LID and PPI dysfunction. Once testing was complete, tissue was collected for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to examine the monoamine levels in motor and non-motor circuits. Results indicate that bilateral DA lesions produced motor deficits and that chronic L-DOPA induced moderate AIMs; importantly, rats that developed more severe AIMs were more likely to display sensorimotor gating dysfunction. In addition, VZD treatment dose-dependently reduced L-DOPA-induced AIMs without impairing L-DOPA efficacy, although VZD's effects on PPI were limited. Altogether, this project established the bilateral 6-OHDA lesion model accurately portrayed LID and PDAP-like behaviors, uncovered their potential relationship, and finally, demonstrated the utility of VZD for reducing LID.",

      "abstract": "The pharmacological manipulation of neuroinflammation appears to be a promising strategy to alleviate l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson's disease (PD). Doxycycline (Doxy), a semisynthetic brain-penetrant tetracycline antibiotic having interesting anti-inflammatory properties, we addressed the possibility that this compound could resolve LID in l-DOPA-treated C57BL/6 mice presenting either moderate or intermediate lesions of the mesostriatal dopaminergic pathway generated by intrastriatal injections of 6-OHDA. Doxy, when given subcutaneously before l-DOPA at doses of 20 mg kg-1 and 40 mg kg-1, led to significant LID reduction in mice with moderate and intermediate dopaminergic lesions, respectively. Importantly, Doxy did not reduce locomotor activity improved by l-DOPA. To address the molecular mechanism of Doxy, we sacrificed mice with mild lesions 1) to perform the immunodetection of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and Fos-B and 2) to evaluate a panel of inflammation markers in the striatum, such as cyclooxygenase-2 and its downstream product Prostaglandin E2 along with the cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. TH-immunodetection revealed that vehicle and Doxy-treated mice had similar striatal lesions, excluding that LID improvement by Doxy could result from neurorestorative effects. Importantly, LID inhibition by Doxy was associated with decreased Fos-B and COX-2 expression and reduced levels of PGE2, TNF-α, and IL-1β in the dorsolateral striatum of dyskinetic mice. We conclude 1) that Doxy has the potential to prevent LID regardless of the intensity of dopaminergic lesioning and 2) that the anti-inflammatory effects of Doxy probably account for LID attenuation. Overall, the present results further indicate that Doxy might represent an attractive and alternative treatment for LID in PD."

      "abstract": "In previous experiments, we have discovered that positive allosteric modulation of metabotropic glutamate 2 (mGlu2) receptors enhances the anti-parkinsonian action of an optimal dose of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). Whether selective mGlu2 positive allosteric modulation would also alleviate parkinsonian disability as monotherapy or as adjunct to a sub-optimal dose of L-DOPA has not been determined. Here, we assessed the anti-parkinsonian effect of mGlu2 positive allosteric modulation as monotherapy and adjunct to a sub-optimal dose of L-DOPA in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned marmosets. The highly selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM) LY-487,379 was utilised to activate mGlu2 receptors. When administered as monotherapy, LY-487,379 10 mg/kg diminished global parkinsonism by 48% (P < 0.001) and increased duration of on-time by 7-fold, when compared to vehicle treatment (P < 0.05). When added to a sub-optimal dose of L-DOPA, LY-487,379 10 mg/kg decreased global parkinsonism by 44% (P < 0.001) and extended duration of on-time by 2.5-fold (P < 0.01). Our results indicate that selective mGlu2 positive allosteric modulation elicits anti-parkinsonian benefits as monotherapy and as adjunct to sub-optimal dose of L-DOPA paradigms, potentially suggesting that mGlu2 PAMs may have a therapeutic niche early in the treatment of PD as DOPA-sparing agents.",

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether cortical sensorimotor inhibition evaluated by short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) related to cholinergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic activities is impaired in PD patients with L-dopa-unresponsive FOG (ONOFF-FOG). METHODS: SAI protocol was performed in 28 PD patients with ONOFF-FOG, 15 PD patients with \"off\" FOG (OFF-FOG), and 25 PD patients without FOG during medication \"on\" state. Additionally, 10 ONOFF-FOG patients underwent SAI testing during both \"off\" and \"on\" states. Twenty healthy controls participated in this study. Gait was measured objectively using a portable Inertial Measurement Unit system, and participants performed 5-meter Timed Up and Go single- and dual-task conditions. Spatiotemporal gait characteristics and their variability were determined. FOG manifestations and cognition were assessed with clinical scales. RESULTS: Compared to controls, PD patients without FOG and with OFF-FOG, ONOFF-FOG PD patients showed significantly reduced SAI. Further, dopaminergic therapy had no remarkable effect on this SAI alterations in ONOFF-FOG. Meanwhile, OFF-FOG patients presented decreased SAI only relative to controls. PD patients with ONOFF-FOG exhibited decreased gait speed, stride length, and increased gait variability relative to PD patients without FOG and controls under both walking conditions. For ONOFF-FOG patients, significant associations were found between SAI and FOG severity, gait characteristics and variability. CONCLUSION: Reduced SAI was associated with severe FOG manifestations, impaired gait characteristics and variability in PD patients with ONOFF-FOG, suggesting the impaired thalamocortical cholinergic-GABAergic SAI pathways underlying ONOFF-FOG.",

L-4-chlorokynurenine (4-Cl-KYN or AV-101) is a pro-drug of 7-chlorokynurenic acid (7-Cl-KYNA), a potent and specific antagonist of the glycine (GlyB) co-agonist site of NMDA receptors. The 7-Cl-KYNA has limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, whereas AV-101 readily accesses the brain. We investigated if AV-101 reduces LID in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned monkeys while maintaining the antiparkinsonian activity of L-Dopa. A first pilot study using three dyskinetic MPTP monkeys showed that acute AV-101 treatment (250 and 450 mg/kg) reduced LID and maintained the antiparkinsonian activity of L-Dopa. The main study using six additional dyskinetic MPTP monkeys showed that repeated AV-101 treatment (250 mg/kg, b.i.d. for 4 consecutive days) maintained their L-Dopa antiparkinsonian response. We measured significantly less LID when AV-101 was combined with L-Dopa treatment. AV-101 alone or with L-Dopa had no non-motor adverse effects in MPTP monkeys. Our study showed antidyskinetic activity of AV-101 in MPTP monkeys was comparable to amantadine tested previously in our laboratory in this model. We observed no adverse effects with AV-101, which is an improvement over amantadine, with its known side effects.",

Here, a one-pot multi-enzyme cascade pathway was designed for DSS synthesis from l-DOPA using tyrosine aminotransferase from Escherichia coli (EcTyrB) and d-isomer-specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus frumenti (LfD2-HDH). Glutamate dehydrogenase from Clostridium difficile (CdgluD) was also introduced for a self-sufficient system of α-ketoglutaric acid and NADH. Under optimal conditions (35 °C, pH 7.0, EcTyrB:LfD2-HDH:CdgluD = 3:2:1, glutamate:NAD+ = 1:1), 98.3% yield (at 20 mM l-DOPA) and space-time yield of 6.61 g L-1 h-1 (at 40 mM l-DOPA) were achieved. Decreased yields of DSS at elevated l-DOPA concentrations (100 mM) could be attributed to an inhibited CdgluD activity caused by NH4+ accumulation. This developed multi-enzyme cascade pathway (including EcTyrB, LfD2-HDH, and CdgluD) provides an efficient and sustainable approach for the production of DSS from l-DOPA.",

      "abstract": "L-dopa variably influences transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) parameters of motor cortex (M1) excitability and plasticity in Parkinson's disease (PD). In patients OFF dopaminergic medication, impaired M1 plasticity and defective GABA-A-ergic inhibition can be restored by boosting gamma (γ) oscillations via transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) during intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS). However, it is unknown whether L-dopa modifies the beneficial effects of iTBS-γ-tACS on M1 in PD. In this study, a PD patients group underwent combined iTBS-γ-tACS and iTBS-sham-tACS, each performed both OFF and ON dopaminergic therapy (four sessions in total). Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by single TMS pulses and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) were assessed before and after iTBS-tACS. We also evaluated possible SICI changes during γ-tACS delivered alone in OFF and ON conditions. The amplitude of MEP elicited by single TMS pulses and the degree of SICI inhibition significantly increased after iTBS-γ-tACS. The amount of change produced by iTBS-γ-tACS was similar in patients OFF and ON therapy. Finally, γ-tACS (delivered alone) modulated SICI during stimulation and this effect did not depend on the dopaminergic condition of patients. In conclusion, boosting cortical γ oscillatory activity via tACS during iTBS improved M1 plasticity and enhanced GABA-A-ergic transmission in PD patients to the same extent regardless of dopaminergic state. These results suggest a lack of interaction between L-dopa and γ-tACS effects at the M1 level. The possible neural substrate underlying iTBS-γ tACS effects, that is, γ-resonant GABA-A-ergic interneurons activity, may explain our findings.",

This work proposes an HPLC-UV method, validated according to EURACHEM guidelines as regards linearity, limits of detection and quantification, precision, accuracy, and matrix effect. The LD extraction was studied by evaluating its aqueous stability over 3 months. The best chromatographic conditions were found by systematically testing several C18 stationary phases and acidic mobile phases. In addition, the assessment of the best storage treatment of Vicia faba L. broad beans able to preserve a high LD content was performed. The best LD determination conditions include sun-drying storage, extraction in HCl 0.1 M, chromatographic separation with a Discovery C18 column, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm particle size, and 99% formic acid 0.2% v/v and 1% methanol as the mobile phase. The optimized method proposed here overcomes the problems linked to LD stability and separation, thus contributing to the improvement of its analytical determination.",

We set out to examine the pattern of cortico-basal ganglia oscillations induced by selective agonists of D1 and D2 receptors in a rat model of LID. Local field potentials were recorded in freely moving rats using large-scale electrodes targeting three motor cortical regions, dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum, external globus pallidus, and substantial nigra pars reticulata. Abnormal involuntary movements were elicited by the D1 agonist SKF82958 or the D2 agonist sumanirole, while overall motor activity was quantified using video analysis (DeepLabCut). Both SKF82958 and sumanirole induced dyskinesia, although with significant differences in temporal course, overall severity, and body distribution. The D1 agonist induced prominent narrowband oscillations in the high gamma range (70-110 Hz) in all recorded structures except for the nigra reticulata. Additionally, the D1 agonist induced strong functional connectivity between the recorded structures and the phase analysis revealed that the primary motor cortex (forelimb area) was leading a supplementary motor area and striatum. Following treatment with the D2 agonist, narrowband gamma oscillations were detected only in forelimb motor cortex and dorsolateral striatum, while prominent oscillations in the theta band occurred in the globus pallidus and nigra reticulata. Our results reveal that the dyskinetic effects of D1 and D2 receptor agonists are associated with distinct patterns of cortico-basal ganglia oscillations, suggesting a recruitment of partially distinct networks.",

      "abstract": "Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons leads to Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by reduced levels of striatal dopamine (DA) and impaired voluntary movements. DA replacement is achieved by levodopa treatment which in long-term causes involuntary movements or dyskinesia. Dyskinesia is linked to the pulsatile activation of D1 receptors of the striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) forming the direct output pathway (dMSNs). The contribution of DA stimulation of D2R in MSNs of the indirect pathway (iMSNs) is less clear. Using the 6-hydroxydopamine model of PD, here we show that loss of DA-mediated inhibition of these neurons intensifies levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) leading to reprogramming of striatal gene expression. We propose that the motor impairments characteristic of PD and of its therapy are critically dependent on D2R-mediated iMSNs activity. D2R signaling not only filters inputs to the striatum but also indirectly regulates dMSNs mediated responses."

      "abstract": "Previous studies indicate a role of dopamine in spatial navigation. Although neural representations of direction are an important aspect of spatial cognition, it is not well understood whether dopamine directly affects these representations, or only impacts other aspects of spatial brain function. Moreover, both dopamine and spatial cognition decline sharply during age, raising the question which effect dopamine has on directional signals in the brain of older adults. To investigate these questions, we used a double-blind cross-over L-DOPA/Placebo intervention design in which 43 younger and 37 older adults navigated in a virtual spatial environment while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We studied the effect of L-DOPA, a dopamine precursor, on fMRI activation patterns that encode spatial walking directions that have previously been shown to lose specificity with age. This was done in predefined regions of interest, including the early visual cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and hippocampus. Classification of brain activation patterns associated with different walking directions was improved across all regions following L-DOPA administration, suggesting that dopamine broadly enhances neural representations of direction. No evidence for differences between regions was found. In the hippocampus these results were found in both age groups, while in the retrosplenial cortex they were only observed in younger adults. Taken together, our study provides evidence for a link between dopamine and the specificity of neural responses during spatial navigation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The sense of direction is an important aspect of spatial navigation, and neural representations of direction can be found throughout a large network of space-related brain regions. But what influences how well these representations track someone's true direction? Using a double-blind cross-over L-DOPA/Placebo intervention design, we find causal evidence that the neurotransmitter dopamine impacts the fidelity of direction selective neural representations in the human hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex. Interestingly, the effect of L-DOPA was either equally present or even smaller in older adults, despite the well-known age related decline of dopamine. These results provide novel insights into how dopamine shapes the neural representations that underlie spatial navigation.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: The pharmacological effects of antidepressants in modulating noradrenergic transmission as compared to serotonergic transmission in a rat model of Parkinson's disease under chronic L-DOPA therapy are insufficiently explored. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine administered chronically alone or jointly with L-DOPA, on motor behavior and monoamine metabolism in selected brain structures of rats with the unilateral 6-OHDA lesion. METHODS: The antiparkinsonian activities of L-DOPA and desipramine were assessed behaviorally using a rotation test and biochemically based on changes in the tissue concentrations of noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin and their metabolites, evaluated separately for the ipsi- and contralateral motor (striatum, substantia nigra) and limbic (prefrontal cortex, hippocampus) structures of rat brain by HPLC method. RESULTS: Desipramine administered alone did not induce rotational behavior, but in combination with L-DOPA, it increased the number of contralateral rotations more strongly than L-DOPA alone. Both L-DOPA and desipramine + L-DOPA significantly increased DA levels in the ipsilateral striatum, substantia nigra, prefrontal cortex and the ipsi- and contralateral hippocampus. The combined treatment also significantly increased noradrenaline content in the ipsi- and contralateral striatum, while L-DOPA alone decreased serotonin level on both sides of the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: The performed analysis of the level of monoamines and their metabolites in the selected brain structures suggests that co-modulation of noradrenergic and dopaminergic transmission in Parkinson's disease by the combined therapy with desipramine + L-DOPA may have some positive implications for motor and psychiatric functions but further research is needed to exclude potential negative effects.",

In this study, a two-step bioprocess for the preparation of SAA from l-DOPA was developed. In the first step, l-DOPA was transformed to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DHPPA) using engineered Escherichia coli cells expressing membrane-bound L-amino acid deaminase from Proteus vulgaris. After that, the unpurified DHPPA was directly converted into SAA by permeabilized recombinant E. coli cells co-expressing d-lactate dehydrogenase from Pediococcus acidilactici and formate dehydrogenase from Mycobacterium vaccae N10. Under optimized conditions, 48.3 mM of SAA could be prepared from 50 mM of l-DOPA, with a yield of 96.6%. Therefore, the bioprocess developed here was not only environmentally friendly, but also exhibited excellent production efficiency and, thus, is promising for industrial SAA production.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The gold standard for symptomatic relief of Parkinson's disease (PD) is L-DOPA. However, long-term treatment often leads to motor complications such as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). While amantadine (Gocovri™) is the only approved therapy for dyskinesia in PD patients on the American market, it is associated with neurological side effects and limited efficacy. Thus, there remains a high unmet need for addressing LID in PD patients worldwide. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and performance compared to approved treatments of the serotonin receptor 1A (5-HT1A) and 5-HT1B/D agonists buspirone and zolmitriptan in the 6-hydroxydopamine unilaterally lesioned rat model for PD. METHODS: The hemiparkinsonian 6-OHDA-lesioned rats underwent chronic treatment with L-DOPA to induce dyskinesia and were subsequently used for efficacy testing of buspirone, zolmitriptan and comparison with amantadine, measured as abnormal involuntary movement (AIM) scores after L-DOPA challenge. Safety testing was performed in model and naïve animals using forelimb adjusting, rotarod and open field tests. RESULTS: 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B/D agonism effectively reduced AIM scores in a synergistic manner. The drug combination of buspirone and zolmitriptan was safe and did not lead to tolerance development following sub-chronic administration. Head-to-head comparison with amantadine showed superior performance of buspirone and zolmitriptan in the model. CONCLUSIONS: The strong anti-dyskinetic effect found with combined 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B/D agonism renders buspirone and zolmitriptan together a meaningful treatment for LID in PD.",

      "abstract": "By decreasing glutamate transmission, mGlu4 receptor positive allosteric modulators (mGlu4-PAM), in combination with levodopa (l-DOPA) may restore the synergy between glutamatergic and dopaminergic transmissions, thus maximizing the improvement of motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to clarify the effects of foliglurax, a selective mGlu4-PAM, on the loss of bidirectional synaptic plasticity associated with l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). Behavioral assessments compared dyskinesia intensity in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats treated with l-DOPA or l-DOPA plus foliglurax. In slices from the same rats, patch-clamp techniques were used to examine electrophysiological differences in glutamatergic synapses, evaluating the EPSCs mediated by NMDA and AMPA receptors in striatal spiny projection neurons. High-frequency stimulation of corticostriatal fibers was used as long-term potentiation (LTP)-inducing protocol. Conversely, 15 min of low-frequency stimulation was applied to depotentiate LTP. The density of dendritic spines was measured in striatal slices in the same experimental conditions. Our results show that, in corticostriatal slices, foliglurax decreased spontaneous glutamatergic transmission in both sham-operated and 6-OHDA lesioned rats. When co-administered with l-DOPA in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, foliglurax fully restored dendritic spine density in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, this co-treatment rescued striatal bidirectional plasticity and attenuated the intensity of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. This is the first demonstration in an animal model of PD and dyskinesia that a mGlu4 PAM can restore striatal synaptic plasticity.",

      "abstract": "L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is one of the important secondary metabolites of plants and has been used for various purposes, such as in clinical treatment for Parkinson's disease and dopamine-responsive dystonia. In plants, L-DOPA is a precursor of many alkaloids, catecholamines, and melanin; the L-DOPA synthesis pathway is similar to that in mammals. L-DOPA acts as an allelochemical, has an important role in several biological processes, such as stress response and metabolism, in plants. L-DOPA is widely used in the clinical treatment as well as a dietary supplement or psychotropic drug, understanding of biosynthesis of L-DOPA in plant could lead to a stable supply of L-DOPA. This paper describes an improved method for simple and rapid quantification of L-DOPA content using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The standard quantitative methods for L-DOPA require multiple purification steps or relatively large amounts of plant material. In our improved method, quantification of L-DOPA was possible with extract of one-two pieces of cotyledon without any partitioning or column for purification. The endogenous L-DOPA (approximately 4,000 µg g-1 FW (fresh weight)) could be detected from the one pieces of cotyledon of the faba bean sprout using this method. This method was also effective for samples with low endogenous amounts of L-DOPA such as broccoli, Japanese white radish, pea, and red cabbage sprouts. Therefore, this improved method will allow to measurement of L-DOPA content easily and accurately from a small amount of plant tissue and contribute to understanding biosynthesis, catabolism, and transport of L-DOPA."

      "abstract": "Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have found applications in biomedicine as diagnostic tools, but extensive research efforts have been also directed toward their development as more efficient drug delivery agents. The high specific surface area of AuNPs may provide dense loading of molecules like catechols (L-DOPA and dopamine) on nanosurfaces, enabling functionalization strategies for advancing conventional therapy and diagnostic approaches of neurodegenerative diseases. Despite numerous well-described procedures in the literature for preparation of different AuNPs, possible transformation and structural changes of surface functionalization agents have not been considered thoroughly. As a case in point, the catechols L-DOPA and dopamine were selected because of their susceptibility to oxidation, cyclization, and polymerization. To assess the fate of coating and functionalization agents during the preparation of AuNPs or interaction at the nano-bio interface, a combination of spectroscopy, light scattering, and microscopy techniques was used while structural information and reaction mechanism were obtained by NMR in combination with computational tools. The results revealed that the final form of catechol on the AuNP nanosurface depends on the molar ratio of Au used for AuNP preparation. A large molar excess of L-DOPA or dopamine is needed to prepare AuNPs funtionalized with fully reduced catechols. In the case of molar excess of Au, the oxidation of catechols to dopamine quinone and dopaquinone was promoted, and dopaquinone underwent intramolecular cyclization in which additional oxidation products, leukodopachrome, dopachrome, or its tautomer, were formed because of the larger intrinsic acidity of the more nucleophilic amino group in dopaquinone. MD simulations showed that, of the oxidation products, dopachrome had the highest affinity for binding to the AuNPs surface. The results highlight how a more versatile methodological approach, combining experimental and in silico techniques, allows more reliable characterization of binding events at the surface of AuNPs for possible applications in biomedicine.",

      "abstract": "Dyskinesia remains an unmet need in Parkinson's disease (PD). We have previously demonstrated that glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) inhibition with ALX-5407 reduces dyskinesia and slightly improves parkinsonism in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned marmoset. Here, we sought to determine the effect of bitopertin, a clinically-tested GlyT1 inhibitor, on parkinsonism and dyskinesia in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rat. To do so, we assessed the effect of bitopertin on parkinsonism as monotherapy and as adjunct to a low dose of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). We then assessed the efficacy of bitopertin on dyskinesia in the context of acute challenge and chronic administration studies. Lastly, we evaluated whether de novo treatment with bitopertin, started concurrently with L-DOPA, would diminish the development of dyskinesia. We discovered that bitopertin (0.3 mg/kg), when administered alone, reduced the severity of parkinsonism by 35% (P < 0.01). As adjunct to a low dose of L-DOPA, bitopertin (3 mg/kg) enhanced the anti-parkinsonian effect of L-DOPA by 36% (P < 0.05). Moreover, the acute addition of bitopertin (0.03 mg/kg) to L-DOPA reduced dyskinesia by 27% (P < 0.001), and there was no tolerance to the anti-dyskinetic benefit after 4 weeks of daily administration. Lastly, bitopertin (0.03 mg/kg) started concurrently with L-DOPA, also attenuated the development of dyskinesia, by 33% (P < 0.01), when compared to L-DOPA alone. Our results suggest that GlyT1 inhibition may simultaneously reduce parkinsonism and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and represents a novel approach to treat, possibly prevent, motor complications in PD.",

Our objective was to test the effect of continuous dopaminergic stimulation (CDS) on LID and the mechanism of its effect on the calcium (Ca2+) signaling pathway. 6-OHDA (6-hydroxydopamine)-treated rats were administered 1% CMC-Na, L-DOPA, rotigotine behenate (RGTB), and L-DOPA + RGTB, respectively, for 28 days. During the treatment, the abnormal involuntary movement (AIM) scores were conducted on days 1, 5, 10, 14, 19, 23 and 28 after the first dose. Subsequently, the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons was detected by immunohistochemistry. Additionally, the changes in Ca2+ were detected using a laser confocal technique, and the related proteins, such as neuronal NOS (nNOS), BAX, BCL2, CaMKII, P-CaMKII, and PSD-95, were measured by Western blot. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to investigate the changes in synaptic structure. The data showed that CDS reduced the AIM scores, increased the expression of TH in the substantia nigra (SN), decreased the expression of nNOS and BAX/BCL2ratio in the striatum, reduced the Ca2+ influx induced by L-DOPA and inhibited the Ca2+ signaling pathways of dopamine neurons in the striatum. Moreover, the overactivity of synapses induced by L-DOPA was inhibited by CDS. These data further support the hypothesis that continuous delivery of a dopamine agonist reduces the risk of LID induction. Moreover, RGTB could be a promising treatment for PD by simulating CDS.",

The current production of L-DOPA is associated with poor productivity and long production period. Biomimetic system inspired from tyrosine hydroxylase was developed to achieve the production of L-DOPA from tyrosine with high reactivity, efficiency, and specificity. The biomimetic system owned close resemblance of component and structure in comparison with tyrosine hydroxylase, consisting of tyrosine as substrate, a redox complex of Fe2+ and EDTA as the catalyst to simulate the active center of the natural tyrosine hydroxylase, hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant, and ascorbic acid as the reductant. HPLC, HPLC-MS/MS, 1H NMR, and specific rotation identified L-DOPA was generated. The system showed high catalytic activity and regioselectivity for hydroxylation of tyrosine as equal to tyrosine hydroxylase. FeIVO2+ was formed as the major active species, and NIH shift was observed. EDTA accelerated the reaction by reducing the redox potential of Fe3+/Fe2+ couple. Density functional theory calculation suggested formation of FeIVO2+ was more thermodynamically favorable. The biomimetic system shared analogous catalytic mechanism with TyrH. Process parameters was optimized for maximum production of L-DOPA, namely 6.4 mM tyrosine, 1.6 mM Fe2+, 1.92 mM EDTA, 150 mM H2O2, and 35 mM ascorbic acid in 0.2 M glycine-HCl buffer at pH 4.5 and 60 °C. The yield, titer, and productivity were obtained as 52.01%, 3.22 mM, and 48,210.68 mg L-1 h-1, respectively. The proposed method exhibited an amazing productivity, might provide a promising strategy to industrialize L-DOPA production.",
