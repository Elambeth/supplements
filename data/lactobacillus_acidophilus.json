      "abstract": "Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) ingestion has been previously shown to be beneficial for glycemic control and pain management, but not in diabetic neuropathy (DN). The present work was designed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of daily treatment with Lactobacillus acidophilus LA85 (LA85) strain in a model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced painful DN in mice and characterize its mechanisms of action. Male C57BL/6 mice received a daily intraperitoneal administration of STZ (60 mg/kg, 3 days). After the establishment of sensory neuropathy, mice were daily treated with LA85 (1.0 × 107 or 1.0 × 109 CFU), vehicle, or gabapentin (isolated or associated with LA85) for 28 days. Nociceptive thresholds were assessed using von Frey and Hargreaves tests. Motor performance was evaluated in the rota-rod test. Glycaemic measurement was determined before and after induction in four different times. Gene expression profile, cytokine levels, and oxidative stress biomarkers in the spinal cord were evaluated by real-time PCR, ELISA, and biochemical assays, respectively. STZ-induced mice showed persistent hyperglycaemia and compatible behavioural signs of sensory neuropathy, such as mechanical allodynia and thermal hypoalgesia. Treatment with LA85, especially at 1.0 × 109 CFU, significantly reduced the neuropathy signs. No LA85-induced motor impairment was evidenced in the rota-rod test. LA85 treatment reduced levels of interleukin-1β, malondialdehyde, and nitrite, and modulated oxidative stress biomarkers in the spinal cord of diabetic mice. The long-lasting antinociceptive effect induced by Lactobacillus acidophilus LA85 during diabetic neuropathy may be associated with reestablishment of redox and immune homeostasis in the spinal cord."

      "abstract": "COVID-19 presents a wide range of symptoms, including gastrointestinal manifestations such as diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain. Lactobacillus acidophilus has been proposed as a potential adjunct therapy to alleviate these symptoms due to its probiotic properties, which help restore gut microbiota balance and modulate immune responses. This review systematically analyzed studies assessing the effects of L. acidophilus in COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. The literature search was conducted through PubMed and the WHO COVID-19 database using keywords such as \"Lactobacillus acidophilus\", \"COVID-19\", \"gastrointestinal symptoms\", and \"inflammation markers\". The search covered studies published until February 2025. Inclusion criteria: observational and clinical trials with L. acidophilus for symptom relief. Exclusion: animal studies and non-ethical approvals. The findings suggest that L. acidophilus supplementation may contribute to faster resolution of diarrhea, improved gut microbiota balance, and reduced inflammatory markers. However, some studies have found no significant impact on hospitalization rates or disease progression. The probiotic's mechanisms of action appear to involve microbiota modulation, intestinal barrier reinforcement, and anti-inflammatory effects rather than direct viral inhibition in COVID-19 after progression. Some L. acidophilus strains show promise, and clinical validation should follow careful preclinical studies (in vitro, cell lines, and animal models), especially in vulnerable populations such as immunocompromised individuals. Understanding the gut-lung axis and its role in immune response regulation, together with the need for a thorough characterization of the specific strains, including biochemical, genomic, and functional properties, before testing in humans, may provide deeper insights into the therapeutic potential of probiotics in viral infections."

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a complex and chronic inflammatory bowel disease whose pathogenesis involves genetic and environmental factors, which poses a challenge for treatment. Here, we have designed an innovative integrated therapeutic strategy using Lactobacillus acidophilus extracellular vesicles (EVs) to encapsulate UiO-66-NH2 nanoparticles bounded with TNF-α siRNA (EVs@UiO-66-NH2@siRNA) for UC treatment. This system shows superior affinity to inflammation-related cells due to the Lactobacillus acidophilus EVs can maintain immune homeostasis by regulating the secretion of cytokines in vitro. siRNA can specifically target the key inflammatory TNF-α in UC and silence its gene expression, thereby regulating the process of inflammatory response. After oral administration, EVs@UiO-66-NH2@siRNA demonstrates an accurate delivery of TNF-α siRNA to colonize the colon site and exerts a siRNA therapeutic effect by inhibiting the expression of TNF-α, which alleviates the intestinal inflammation in DSS-induced UC model. Moreover, this system can modulate the types and compositional structures of gut microbiota and metabolites to achieve an anti-inflammatory phenotype, which is helpful for the repair of intestinal homeostasis. We also have proved that UiO-66-NH2 nanoparticles exhibit a high loading capacity for TNF-α siRNA and good pH responsiveness, improving the potent release of siRNA in colon tissue. Collectively, the EVs@UiO-66-NH2@siRNA nano-delivery system demonstrate a feasible combination therapeutic strategy for UC through gut microecology modulation, immune regulation and TNF-α siRNA silence, which may provide a potential targeted treatment approach for inflammatory bowel disease.",

Therefore, the present study evaluated the effectiveness of five probiotic (viable) and parabiotic (non-viable: heat and acid-treated) strains (Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) in reducing AFM1 in yoghurt over two weeks. It also explored the ability of the micro-encapsulated L. acidophilus and the viable and non-viable new bacterial/yeast combinations (L. acidophilus- B. bifidum- S. cerevisiae) as promising and new strategies to eliminate and control AFM1 in the dairy plant. All the studied strains reduced AFM1 efficiently in pro and parabiotic yoghurt compared to the control yoghurt (without fortification) (P < 0.05), with the highest efficacy in L. acidophilus. Furthermore, the bacterial/yeast combination scored a better AFM1 reduction percentage than the single treatments, with a binding percentage of 90 % in acid-treated co-culture. However, the innovative application of the encapsulated L. acidophilus with chitosan-CaCl2-alginate (Alg/CaCl2/CH) and chitosan‑sodium tripolyphosphate (CH/TPP) was considered the best treatment as they achieved fast and significant AFM1 reduction percentages of 68 and 81 %, respectively, from the first day of storage. In conclusion, these findings provided a safe and effective solution for AFM1 control in the dairy industry. Additionally, the effective reduction percentages obtained by parabiotics open the door for extensive application in non-fermented dairy foods."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lactobacillus species have attracted more and more attention as a potential antibiotic substitute for human health and animal production due to their remarkable antibacterial effects. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. This experiment's goal was to investigate the impacts of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on the growth performance, carcass characteristics, immune function of broiler chickens and their mechanism. METHODS: One hundred and eighty 1-day-old AA broilers were used and randomly allocated into 3 treatment groups with 6 replicates of 10 chickens per replicate. The 3 treatment groups were control group (CK), L. acidophilus added group (LAB-E, 1.0 × 108 CFU/kg) for the first 7 days; L. acidophilus added group (LAB-A, 1.0 × 108 CFU/kg) for the whole experimental period. Broilers had free access to water and feed. RESULTS: The results showed that addition of L. acidophilus for the whole experimental period significantly decreased ADFI, FCR and the abdominal fat percentage of broilers (p < 0.05), tended to increase the levels of IgG in broiler serum (p = 0.093). The LAB-A group had higher HDL-C content and IL-2, IL-4 content, and lower level of LPS in broiler serum compared to the controls (p < 0.05). DISCUSSION: In conclusion, L. acidophilus improved feed efficiency and immune function of broilers by controlling nutrient metabolism and inflammation responses of broilers. L. acidophilus can be used as a potential substitute for antibiotics in broiler production."

      "abstract": "Oncolytic viruses (OVs) hold promise for cancer treatment. However, the antitumor efficacy is limited. Microbiota plays a pivotal role in cancer treatment and its impact on oncolytic virotherapy is unknown. Here, we show that VSVΔ51 has higher antitumor efficacy for hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of microbiota in female mouse models. VSVΔ51 infection causes microbiota dysbiosis, increasing most of the gut bacteria abundance, while decreasing the commensal Lactobacillus. VSVΔ51 reduced intestinal expression of SLC20A1 that binds to Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) CdpA cell wall protein through IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling, thereby attenuating attachment and colonization of L. acidophilus. L. acidophilus supplementation confers sensitivity to VSVΔ51 through restoring gut barrier integrity and microbiota homeostasis destroyed by VSVΔ51. In this work, we show that targeting microbiota homostasis holds substantial potential in improving therapeutic outcomes of oncolytic virotherapy.",

Recent interest has grown in exploring the potential of probiotics and prebiotics as complementary therapies. This study investigates the combined effects of the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and the prebiotic Balanites aegyptiaca on blood glucose levels, oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers in an alloxan-induced diabetic rat model. METHODS: A total of 40 male rats (100-110 g; 8-10 weeks) were randomly divided into five groups: a normal control group, a diabetic control group, and diabetic groups treated with Lactobacillus acidophilus, Balanites aegyptiaca, or their combination. The mice in the diabetic groups were orally treated with 28.5 mg/kg of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Balanites aegyptiaca, or both twice daily for 30 days. Blood glucose levels were measured before and after treatment. Antioxidant enzyme activities, including glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione Stransferase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase, were assessed. Inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) and lipid profiles (cholesterol and triglycerides) were also evaluated. RESULTS: The combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Balanites aegyptiaca significantly reduced blood glucose levels in diabetic rats from 295 mg/dl to 114 mg/dl, outperforming the effects of either treatment alone. Antioxidant enzyme activities were markedly enhanced in the combined treatment group, indicating reduced oxidative stress. The combined therapy also significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 compared to the diabetic control group. Furthermore, lipid profiles showed improved cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the combined treatment group, even in a high-lipid diet. CONCLUSION: The combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Balanites aegyptiaca reduced hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and inflammation in diabetic rats, suggesting potential as a complementary diabetes therapy."

We aimed to evaluate the antibacterial properties of C-dots derived from Lactobacillus acidophilus (L-C-dots) alone and in combination against carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates. METHODS: Seventy clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were tested for carbapenem resistance using a modified carbapenem inactivation assay. To determine the presence of fimH and mrkD genes, which are associated with biofilm formation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted. L-C-dots were synthesized using a hydrothermal method and characterized. Furthermore, their antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities were evaluated against CRKP isolates. The combination of L-C-dots with the meropenem antibiotics were also tested using a checkerboard assay. Finally, the influence of L-C-dots on the expression levels of fimH and mrkD genes was examined using quantitative PCR (qPCR). RESULTS: L-C-dots demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against CRKP isolates, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 50 mg/mL and a sub-MIC of 25 mg/mL. L-C-dots effectively inhibited biofilm formation at MIC and sub-MIC concentrations (P ˂ 0.05). Additionally, the L-C-dots had synergistic and additive interactions with the meropenem antibiotics against CRKP isolates, reducing the MIC of both agents. Furthermore, the L-C-dots decreased the expression of the fimH(p< 0.029) and mrkD (p < 0.015) genes. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that L-C-dots may serve as a promising new treatment option for CRKP infections. They show potential as a strong therapeutic choice, especially when used in combination with traditional antibiotics.",

Typhimurium) infection can cause inflammation and oxidative stress in the body, leading to gastroenteritis, fever and other diseases in humans and animals. More and more studies have emphasized the broad prospects of probiotics in improving inflammation and oxidative stress, but the ability and mechanism of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) to alleviate the inflammatory/oxidative reaction caused by pathogens are still unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we treated the mice with LA for 14 days, infected them with S. Typhimurium for 24 h, and sacrificed the mice to collect samples. We found that the early intervention of LA alleviated the pathological injury and reversed the down-regulation of the duodenal and hepatic tight junction protein mRNA levels caused by S. Typhimurium infection. Compared with S. Typhimurium group, LA early intervention increased the expression of antioxidant enzymes, but decreased the levels of serum malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Additionally, LA early intervention significantly increased Nrf2 mRNA expression in the liver and decreased Keap1 mRNA expression in the duodenum compared to the S. Typhimurium group. Furthermore, early LA treatment reduced the abundance of Bacteroides acidificiens, increased the abundance of Akkermansia, and alleviated the decrease in SCFAs levels in the cecum of S. Typhimurium-infected mice. Spearman correlation analysis showed that there was a certain correlation between cecal flora and serum indicators and short chain fatty acids. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the results indicate that LA early intervention may alleviates S. Typhimurium-induced inflammation and oxidative responses in mice by activating the p62-Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway and regulating the gut microbial community. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Exploring the ability of LA to resist animal oxidative stress and microflora regulation caused by pathogenic microbes, so as to provide more options for developing healthy disease-resistant feed additives."

Moreover, they not only reduced fasting blood glucose and glucose/insulin resistance, but also improved dyslipidemia, liver function and inflammation. Further high-performance liquid chromatography analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that EPS is an acidic polysaccharide, characterized by a molecular weight of 952 kDa and predominantly composed of glucose. Additionally, the mechanism investigation revealed that the L. acidophilus YL01 and EPS demonstrated limited efficacy in restoring the composition of gut microbiota, but rather exerted an influence on the abundance of specific bacterial groups. The enrichment of the bacterial groups resulted in the increase of acetic acid and butyric acid, which further mediates the gut-liver crosstalk in regulating lipid metabolism by the activation of AMPK/ACC pathway.",

Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus), a probiotic, has been reported to be effective against blastocystosis. The present study evaluated the therapeutic and prophylactic effectiveness of L. acidophilus compared to metronidazole (MTZ) in rats experimentally infected with Blastocystis subtype 3 (ST3). Four groups of Blastocystis ST3-infected rats received MTZ, L. acidophilus, both MTZ and L. acidophilus, or prophylactic L. acidophilus. Non-infected and infected control groups were included. The effectiveness of treatment and prevention was evaluated using parasitological monitoring, histopathological examination, immunohistochemical staining for TNF-α and IgA expression, and immunological testing for TNF-α and IL-10. In the L. acidophilus-treated group, a 76% reduction in the mean fecal parasitic count and a 67% clearance in the intestinal wash were achieved aligning closely with outcomes observed in the MTZ-treated group. An immunomodulatory impact via upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and downregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α was demonstrated as well. Combined administration of MTZ and L. acidophilus exhibited superior efficacy with a 99% decrease in the mean fecal parasitic count and a 98% decrease in the intestinal fluid parasitic count. Additionally, the lowest TNF-α and the highest IL-10 serum levels. Prophylactic use of L. acidophilus for 7 days neither prevented infection nor reduced its severity. Furthermore, no significant differences were detected in serum levels of TNF-α and IL-10 following post-prophylaxis and post-treatment with L. acidophilus. Accordingly, L. acidophilus might be recommended as an adjuvant treatment alongside MTZ for improved efficacy against blastocystosis.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of total metabolites of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (LP) against common equine endometrial pathogenic bacteria in vitro (Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli (1), Escherichia coli (2), Escherichia coli (3), Escherichia coli (4), Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus equi, Staphylococcus warneri, Actinobacillus equi and Klebesiella pneumoniae), as well as to assess their low molecular weight metabolites (loM) and extracellular vesicle (EVs) inhibition capacity over a multidrug-resistant E. coli isolated from mares with clinical endometritis. The total metabolites of LA showed better inhibition on A. baumannii, E. coli (1) and E. cloacae, while those of LP inhibited E. coli (4), S. equi and A. equi. Besides total metabolites, loM of LA and LP can inhibit E. coli. LA EVs were more effective in preventing E. coli (2) compared to LA loM, while LP EVs presented inhibition but below 90%. The use of LA and LP in the mare's uterus may be an interesting approach to controlling endometritis. In addition to metabolites, EVs can contribute to the inhibition of multidrug-resistant E. coli.",

Exopolysaccharides (EPS) from probiotic bacteria have been shown to regulate microbial composition and metabolism, but their role in promoting probiotic growth and alleviating inflammation in UC remains unclear. Here, we investigate BLEPS-1, a novel EPS derived from Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum XZ01, for its ability to promote the growth of Lactobacillus strains. We then tested a synbiotic formulation of BLEPS-1 and L. acidophilus in a DSS-induced UC mouse model. The combination of BLEPS-1 and L. acidophilus alleviated DSS-induced intestinal inflammation, outperforming either component alone. Administration of BLEPS-1 decreased the proportion of M1 macrophages in the intestine, while M2 macrophages were more abundant following L. acidophilus treatment. Together, BLEPS-1 and L. acidophilus synergistically modulated macrophage polarization toward the M2-type. Administration of BLEPS-1 and L. acidophilus together modulated gut microbiota composition and altered the gut metabolic profile, with BLEPS-1 and L. acidophilus promoting metabolism of short-chain fatty acids and aromatic amino acids, respectively. Our study identified a novel synbiotic formulation with potent immunomodulatory and metabolic activity, laying the groundwork for a promising therapeutic strategy to treat intestinal inflammatory diseases such as colitis.",

In this study, jujube juice was used as a substrate and fermented by L. acidophilus 6074 to investigate its effects on gut microbiota, intestinal barrier function, oxidative stress, inflammatory factors, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in mice with colitis and to reveal its potential mechanism for alleviating colitis. The results demonstrated that fermentation caused significant changes in the nutrients and nonnutrients of jujube juice, mainly in organic acids (malic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, and succinic acid) and free amino acids (Thr, Met, Ser, Ile, and Lys). High-dose LAFJ (20 mL/kg/day) significantly reduced the disease activity index (DAI), improved histopathological morphology, and increased colon length in colitis mice. LAFJ alleviated colon damage and preserved the integrity of the colonic mucosal barrier by promoting the expression of colonic tight junction proteins occludin, claudin-1, and zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1). Furthermore, LAFJ inhibited the production of proinflammatory factors and attenuated oxidative stress. Gut microbiota of mice revealed that LAFJ increased beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Akkermansia, promoted the production of SCFAs, and inhibited the growth of harmful microorganisms. Overall, LAFJ could reshape and restore gut microbiota imbalance caused by intestinal inflammation and alleviate the development of colitis, which may become a novel dietary intervention.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the compound Lactobacillus acidophilus in combination with montmorillonite powder on the inflammatory response in children with rotavirus enteritis (RVE). METHODS: A total of 94 children with RVE admitted to our hospital between June 2021 and April 2023 were selected and divided into two groups using a random digit table method. Each group consisted of 47 children. Both groups were administered standard symptomatic treatment upon admission. The control group was additionally administered montmorillonite powder, while the observation group was administered compound L. acidophilus tablets in addition to the treatment administered to the control group. Both the treatments were administered for a duration of 5 days. Parameters such as clinical efficacy, symptom relief time (diarrhea, vomiting, fever, dehydration), inflammatory response (C-reactive protein [CRP]), and adverse reactions (constipation, bloating, drowsiness, skin allergy, dry mouth) were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Posttreatment, the observation group exhibited a significantly higher total effective rate (95.74%) compared to the control group (78.72%). The symptom relief time for diarrhea ([2.23 ± 0.48] days), vomiting ([1.38 ± 0.25] days), fever ((1.91 ± 0.68) days), and dehydration ([2.74 ± 0.53] days) in the observation group were all significantly shorter than those in the control group ([3.42 ± 0.71] days, [2.65 ± 0.54] days, [2.76 ± 0.84] days, and [4.60 ± 0.89] days), respectively. The posttreatment CRP levels in the observation group were (5.26 ± 1.32) mg/L, lower than those in the control group (7.45 ± 1.58) mg/L, although this difference was not statistically significant. The incidence of adverse reactions was 14.89% in the observation group and 8.51% in the control group, with no significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSION: The combination of compound L. acidophilus and montmorillonite effectively shortens the symptom recovery time and improves inflammatory response in children with RVE, while maintaining a high safety profile."

The present study evaluated the chemopreventive effect of the combined treatment of Lactobacillus acidophilus, calcium citrate, and Moringa oleifera leaves extract against DMH (1,1-dimethylhydrazine hydrochloride) induced colon cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats were grouped into 10 different groups and treated with DMH 30 mg/kg s.c. for 8 weeks, Successful induction of colon cancer was confirmed with the help of symptoms, Individual and combined treatments of Lactobacillus acidophilus (109 cfu p.o.), calcium citrate (2 mg/kg p.o.) and Moringa oleifera (100 & 200 mg/kg p.o.) leaves extracts were used for 4 weeks. RESULT: After 4 weeks of treatment, it was observed that a significant reduction in aberrant crypt foci (ACFs) count, whereas liver and kidney function, AST (aspartate transaminase), ALT (alanine transaminase), urea and creatinine biomarkers were retained in its normal range. Upon DMH treatment, liver tissue loses histoarchitecture with mononuclear cell infiltration, nuclear enlargement, and hyperchromasia, this reverts due to the combined treatment of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA), calcium citrate (CC) and hydroalcoholic extract of Moringa oleifera leaves (ME). From the results, it was revealed that individual and combined treatment of Lactobacillus acidophilus, calcium citrate, and hydroalcoholic extract of Moringa oleifera leaves shows beneficial effects against the carcinogen. CONCLUSION: Combined treatment of Lactobacillus acidophilus, calcium citrate, and hydroalcoholic extract of Moringa oleifera leaves showed positive effects against carcinogenesis and lowered aberrant crypt foci count and shows histoarchitectural improvements in liver histology with no nuclear enlargement and hyperchromasia in liver tissue.",

      "abstract": "Continuous use of antibiotics in poultry feed as growth promoters poses a grave threat to humanity through the emergence of antibiotic resistance, necessitating the exploration of novel and sustainable alternatives. The present study was carried out to evaluate the performance of postbiotics derived from Lactobacillus acidophilus in broiler birds. The postbiotics were harvested by culturing probiotic bacteria from the stock cultures at the required temperature and duration under laboratory conditions and supplemented to broilers via feed. For experimentation, 480-day-old CARI-Bro Dhanraja (slow-growing broiler) straight-run chicks were randomly split up into six groups. Treatment groups diets are as follows: T1- Basal diet (BD)+0.2%(v/w) MRS Broth/ uninoculated media; T2 - BD + Antibiotic (CTC); T3- BD + Probiotic; T4, T5 & T6 - BD + postbiotics supplementation of 0.2%, 0.4% and 0.6% (v/w) respectively. The chicks were raised under an intensive, deep litter system with standard protocol for 6 weeks. Results showed that 0.2% of postbiotics (T4) had significantly (P < 0.001) higher body weight (1677.52 g) with better FCR (1.75) and immune response. Postbiotic supplementation altered various serum attributes positively, in this study. Significant (P < 0.001) reductions in total plate counts (TPC), coliform counts, and maximum Lactobacillus counts were recorded in all postbiotic-supplemented groups. The villus height (1379.25 μm), width (216.06 μm) and crept depth (179.25 μm) showed significant (P < 0.001) improvement among the treatment groups on the 21st and 42nd day of the experimental trial, with the highest value in the T4 group (0.2% postbiotic supplementation). Jejunal antioxidant values also noted significantly (P < 0.001) higher values in T4 group. The study concludes that 0.2% postbiotic supplementation can act as a substitute to antibiotic growth promoters and also combat the disfavour activity of probiotics in broilers.",

We evaluate the functional and molecular gastrointestinal responses to a synbiotic administration combining CG and NCFM in a rat model of long-lasting colon hypersensitivity. The intracolonic pressure was assessed during the 9-week experiment in animals receiving CG in association or not with NCFM and compared to that in Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Lpc-37®-treated animals and control rats receiving tap water. The effects of the synbiotic were evaluated using the Wallace score, the quantification of colon myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the master genes driving analgesia and inflammation. CG 1.5 alone and NCFM 109 colony forming units (CFU) alone similarly decreased the visceral pain sensitivity. Lpc-37 had no significant effect. The best profile of pain perception inhibition was obtained with the combination of CG 1.5 g and NCFM 109 CFU, confirming a synbiotic property. This synbiotic treatment significantly reduced macroscopic colonic lesions and MPO concentrations, and induced master genes involved in analgesia (CB1, CB2, MOR, PPARα), with a downregulation of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNFα) and an induction of IL-10 and PPARγ. In conclusion, CG 1.5 g + NCFM 109 CFU significantly decreased visceral pain perception and intestinal inflammation through the regulation of master genes.",

      "abstract": "The viability and functional activity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), such as Lactobacillus acidophilus in a fermented milk product is important. One of the functional activities of the LAB in fermented milk is the ability of the LAB to positively impact the human health. This study aimed to determine the effect of frozen storage on the fermented milk, namely acidophilus milk, based on the nutritional milk quality, the viability of L. acidophilus, and its potential to lower cholesterol levels in Wistar rats. The parameters measured was including milk quality (mainly pH, protein content, lactic acid levels, and syneresis), L. acidophilus bacterial viability in frozen storage (for 1, 2, and 3 months), and some biological assays to evaluate the potential of milk in lowering blood cholesterol levels in Wistar rats. The result of this study suggests that acidophilus milk quality can be maintained in frozen storage for two months, and it had lactic acid levels of 1.07%, pH of 4.08, and protein levels of 3.33%. Giving acidophilus milk to Wistar rats for 15 days could reduce the cholesterol level continuously until 30 days of treatment. Therefore, this study proves that acidophilus milk quality can be maintained very well in frozen storage, and its functional properties to lower the cholesterol level of Wistar rats can be achieved after two weeks of consumption."

      "abstract": "Lactobacillus acidophilus is a probiotic commonly used in aquaculture to enhance the growth and immune system of aquatic species through the synthesis of various enzymes, and antimicrobial compounds like lactic acid. Traditional method of growing L. acidophilus involes using the De Man-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS) medium. However, L. acidophilus belongs to a non-spore forming group, which make it vulnerable to stress conditions, especially during the usage process. Therefore, the present study aimed to improve the survival rate, antibacterial activity, and enrich the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) content of L. acidophilus LB when cultured in an algae-supplemented medium, thus increasing its benefits in aquaculture applications. Using different algae biomass species as an alternative to MRS medium for the growth of L. acidophilus LB, the results showed that Spirulina platensis promoted the highest density of L. acidophilus LB. When grown in (S. platensis + glucose) medium, L. acidophilus LB produced the highest lactic acid concentration of 18.24 ± 2.43 mg/mL and survived in extreme conditions such as 4% NaCl, pH 1.0-2.0, and 50 ºC, and inhibited 99.82 ± 0.24% of Vibrio parahaemolyticus population after 2 days of treatment. Additionally, it was observed that the PUFAs content, specifically omega-6, and -7, also increased in the fermentation mixture as compared to the control sample. These findings highlighted the potential of utilizing the cyanobacteria S. platensis as an alternative, eco-friendly growth substance for L. acidophilus LB to enhance its bioactivity and viability under extreme conditions.",

However, understanding the effects of paraprobiotics on the growth performance and gut microbiota of piglets and how the paraprobiotics exert their impact are still limited. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus IFFI 6005 supplementation on the growth performance, intestinal microbiota, and fecal metabolites of piglets. First, a feed-additive sample of heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus IFFI 6005 was prepared by culture. Second, 96 (initial BW = 14.38 ± 0.67 kg, weaning age of 40 days) healthy piglets were selected and randomized into four treatment groups. Each treatment group consisted of three replicates (n = 8). Pigs were fed a basal diet (NC), basal diet plus antibiotics (PC), basal diet plus Lactobacillus acidophilus IFFI 6005 at 600 g/t (LA, 1.0 × 1010 cfu/g), and basal diet plus heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus IFFI 6005 at 600 g/t (HKLA), respectively; the trial lasted for 30 days. The results showed that the ratios of feed to gain (F:G) and diarrhea rate of both the HKLA and PC groups were significantly lower compared with the NC and LA groups (p < 0.05); however, there was no significant difference between the HKLA and PC group (p > 0.05). In addition, the average daily weight gain (ADG) of the HKLA group was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of the other three groups in terms of growth performance. Finally, 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolome analysis based on fecal samples further elaborated that the addition of heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus IFFI 6005 to the feed improved the intestinal microbial diversity and abundance (p < 0.05) and reduced the abundance of pathogenic bacteria (p < 0.05), but it did not affect the abundance of Lactobacillus (p > 0.05). Through the comparison of microbial abundance and metabolite content between the two groups (NC_vs_HKLA), the largest differences were found in six microorganisms and 10 metabolites in the intestine (p < 0.05). These differential metabolites were involved in the digestion, absorption and utilization of protein and starch, as well as in oxidative stress. In summary, addition of heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus IFFI 6005 as a new feed additive in piglets has beneficial effects on the growth performance, intestinal bacteria and metabolites, and can be used as an alternative to antibiotics."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a global public health concern. A synbiotic preparation containing Bifidobacterium lactis and Lactobacillus acidophilus has been used as adjunct therapy for hypertension. We sought to elucidate the antihypertensive activity of this preparation and explore the underlying mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Blood pressure in rats was measured using the tail-cuff method. Colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by the two probiotics was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Mechanistic studies were performed by proteomic analyses based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and STRING database and metabolomic analyses using the UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS platform and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)β/γ antagonists. Although biochemical analysis of blood samples showed that the synbiotic preparation did not alter the levels of angiotensin II, aldosterone, or cortisol, it significantly lowered the systolic blood pressure in the treatment group. Moreover, the synbiotic preparation contributed to the localization of the two probiotics in the ileum and colon of the treatment group. Proteomics, immunochemistry, and real-time qPCR analyses showed that administration of the synbiotic preparation activated the PPAR signaling pathway in the ileum and significantly upregulated PPARβ and PPARγ. The antagonist studies further confirmed this finding. In addition, metabolomic analyses demonstrated that among the 27 metabolites that showed significant differences between the control and model groups, administration of the synbiotic preparation significantly upregulated lysophosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine in the ileum of the treatment group. CONCLUSION: The results of the study suggest that the novel synbiotic preparation reduces blood pressure by altering the composition of the intestinal microbiota, regulating PPAR signaling pathway, and activating the PPARβ and PPARγ cascade reactions in the ileum."

      "abstract": "Gut microbiota dysbiosis is involved in cholestatic liver diseases. However, the mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects and mechanisms of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) on cholestatic liver injury in both animals and humans. Bile duct ligation (BDL) was performed to mimic cholestatic liver injury in mice and serum liver function was tested. Gut microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Fecal bacteria transplantation (FMT) was used to evaluate the role of gut microbiota in cholestasis. Bile acids (BAs) profiles were analyzed by targeted metabolomics. Effects of L. acidophilus in cholestatic patients were evaluated by a randomized controlled clinical trial (NO: ChiCTR2200063330). BDL induced different severity of liver injury, which was associated with gut microbiota. 16S rRNA sequencing of feces confirmed the gut flora differences between groups, of which L. acidophilus was the most distinguished genus. Administration of L. acidophilus after BDL significantly attenuated hepatic injury in mice, decreased liver total BAs and increased fecal total BAs. Furthermore, after L. acidophilus treatment, inhibition of hepatic Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7α1), restored ileum Fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) and Small heterodimer partner (SHP) accounted for BAs synthesis decrease, whereas enhanced BAs excretion was attributed to the increase of unconjugated BAs by enriched bile salt hydrolase (BSH) enzymes in feces. Similarly, in cholestasis patients, supplementation of L. acidophilus promoted the recovery of liver function and negatively correlated with liver function indicators, possibly in relationship with the changes in BAs profiles and gut microbiota composition. L. acidophilus treatment ameliorates cholestatic liver injury through inhibited hepatic BAs synthesis and enhances fecal BAs excretion.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Defective intestinal epithelial tight junction (TJ), characterized by an increase in intestinal TJ permeability, has been shown to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the immunopathology of IBD and has been shown to cause an increase in intestinal epithelial TJ permeability. Although TNF-α antibodies and other biologics have been advanced for use in IBD treatment, these therapies are associated with severe side effects and have limited efficacy, and there is an urgent need for therapies with benign profiles and high therapeutic efficacy. Probiotic bacteria have beneficial effects and are generally safe and represent an important class of potential therapeutic agents in IBD. Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) is one of the most used probiotics for wide-ranging health benefits, including in gastrointestinal, metabolic, and inflammatory disorders. A specific strain of LA, LA1, was recently demonstrated to have protective and therapeutic effects on the intestinal epithelial TJ barrier. However, the mechanisms of actions of LA1 remain largely unknown. METHODS: The primary aim of this study was to investigate microbial-epithelial interactions and novel signaling pathways that regulate the effect of LA1 on TNF-α-induced increase in intestinal epithelial TJ permeability, using cell culture and animal model systems. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment of filter-grown Caco-2 monolayers with LA1 prevented the TNF-α-induced increase in intestinal epithelial TJ permeability by inhibiting TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB p50/p65 and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) gene and kinase activity in a TLR-2-dependent manner. LA1 produced a TLR-2- and MyD88-dependent activation of NF-κB p50/p65 in immune cells; however, LA1, in intestinal cells, inhibited the NF-κB p50/p65 activation in a TLR-2-dependent but MyD88-independent manner. In addition, LA1 inhibition of NF-κB p50/p65 and MLCK gene was mediated by TLR-2 pathway activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and IKK-α phosphorylation. Our results demonstrated novel intracellular signaling pathways by which LA1/TLR-2 suppresses the TNF-α pathway activation of NF-κB p50/p65 in intestinal epithelial cells and protects against the TNF-α-induced increase in intestinal epithelial TJ permeability.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Menopause poses significant health risks for women, particularly an increased vulnerability to fractures associated with osteoporosis. Dietary interventions have emerged as promising strategies, focusing on mitigating the risk of osteoporosis rather than solely addressing the established disease. This 12-week randomized controlled trial aimed to analyze the effects of consuming Lactobacillus acidophilus probiotics on calcium levels, biomarkers of bone metabolism, and bone mineral density (BMD) profiles in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Fifty-five participants were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo (n = 25) or the probiotic L. acidophilus UALa-01™ (n = 30) daily via oral intervention. Throughout the study, evaluations included body composition, blood biochemical parameters, serum calcium levels, and biomarkers of bone metabolism. Additionally, Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to measure BMD profiles. RESULTS: The findings delineated that the probiotic group experienced a decrease in serum calcium levels compared to their initial levels. However, hair calcium levels and biomarkers related to bone metabolism showed no notable changes within this group. Consumption of probiotic L. acidophilus also seemed to prevent fluctuations in bone turnover markers. Moreover, there were no significant alterations in BMD levels at the lumbar spine, left femur, and total body in the probiotic group. Additionally, probiotic intake led to favorable outcomes by significantly reducing both body fat and visceral fat during the intervention period. Conversely, an adverse effect of consuming probiotic L. acidophilus was observed with a significant increase in glucose concentration. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the consumption of L. acidophilus probiotics daily for 12 weeks among postmenopausal women does not affect the profile of BMD, but it may help in stabilizing bone turnover. It is important to note that most measured parameters were within the normal range for this population. However, it is worth noting that 3 months of probiotic supplementation could potentially disrupt calcium and glucose status in postmenopausal women."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (C. p), a facultative intracellular bacterium, is an important zoonotic pathogen that causes abscesses and pyogenic granulomas. The relationship between gut microbiota and host health or diseases has received increasing attention. However, the role of gut microbiota in the process of C. p infection is still unclear. In this study, we established a C. p infection model in C57BL/6 mice and examined the impact of preemptive oral administration Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) on infection. Our findings revealed that C. p infection led to pronounced pathological alterations in the liver and kidneys, characterized by abscess formation, intense inflammatory responses, and bacterial overload. Remarkably, these deleterious effects were greatly relieved by oral administration of L. acidophilus before infection with C. p. Additionally, we further found that during C. p infection, peritoneal macrophages (PMs) of mice orally administered with L. acidophilus accumulated more rapidly at sites of infection. Furthermore, our results showed that PMs from mice with oral L. acidophilus administration showed a stronger C. p clearance effect, and this was mediated by high expression of LC3-II protein. Meanwhile, oral administration of L. acidophilus protected the gut microbiota disorder in C57BL/6 mice caused by C. p infection. In summary, our study demonstrates that oral administration of L. acidophilus confers effective protection against C. p infection in C57BL/6 mice by modulating macrophage autophagy, thereby augmenting bacterial clearance and preserving gut microbiota and function stability. These findings position L. acidophilus as a viable probiotic candidate for the clinical prevention of C. p infection. IMPORTANCE: Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (C. p) is known to induce a range of chronic diseases in both animals and humans. Currently, clinical treatment for C. p infection mainly relies on antibiotic therapy or surgical intervention. However, excessive use of antibiotics may increase the risk of drug-resistant strains, and the effectiveness of treatment remains unsatisfactory. Furthermore, surgical procedures do not completely eradicate pathogens and can easily cause environmental pollution. Probiotic interventions are receiving increasing attention for improving the body's immune system and maintaining health. In this study, we established a C. p infection model in C57BL/6 mice to explore the impact of Lactobacillus acidophilus during C. p infection. Our results showed that L. acidophilus effectively protected against C. p infection by regulating the autophagy of macrophages and maintaining intestinal microbiota homeostasis. This study may provide a new strategy for the prevention of C. p infection.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Soybean meal (SBM) is used widely in animal feed but it contains anti-nutritional factors (ANFs) such as protease inhibitors - immunogenic proteins that limit its utilization. Fermentative processes could help to reduce these ANFs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the nutritional attributes, bacterial community dynamics, and microbial metagenomic profile during the solid-state fermentation of SBM using a strain of the bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus with or without pre-autoclaving treatment. RESULTS: Following fermentation, there was a reduction in the pH and a concurrent increase in the population of lactic acid bacteria. Fermentation also resulted in an increase in both crude and soluble protein levels. Trypsin inhibitor levels decreased after fermentation, particularly in fermented SBM that had not been pre-autoclaved, with an inactivation rate higher than 90%. Moreover, high-molecular-weight peptides (44-158 kDa), specifically some polypeptides from the soybean immunogen glycinin and β-conglycinin, underwent degradation during the fermentation process. Bacterial community analysis revealed the dominance of the Lactobacillus genus in all samples, regardless of the treatments applied. Metagenomic profiling identified L. acidophilus as the dominant species in inoculated SBM, irrespective of whether pre-autoclaving was conducted or not. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of solid-state fermentation with L. acidophilus under non-sterile conditions to inactivate trypsin inhibitor and increase protein concentration and hydrolysate immunogen proteins into low-molecular-weight peptides in SBM. Lactobacillus acidophilus inoculum also inhibited the growth of undesirable bacteria. This knowledge contributes to our understanding of the potential applications of solid-state fermentation with L. acidophilus in improving the nutritional quality of SBM. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is spawned by an inequality between the portion of energy consumed and the quantity of energy expended. Disease entities such as cardiovascular disease, arteriosclerosis, hypertension, and cancer, which are correlated with obesity, influence society and the economy. Suppression of adipogenesis, the process of white adipocyte generation, remains a promising approach for treating obesity. Oil Red O staining was used to differentiate 3T3-L1 cells for screening 20 distinct Lactobacillus species. Among these, Lactobacillus acidophilus DS0079, referred to as YBS1, was selected for further study. YBS1 therapy decreased 3T3-L1 cell development. Triglyceride accumulation and mRNA expression of the primary adipogenic marker, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), including its downstream target genes, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein 4 and adiponectin, were almost eliminated. YBS1 inhibited adipocyte differentiation at the early stage (days 0-2), but no significant difference was noted between the mid-stage (days 2-4) and late-stage (days 4-6) development. YBS1 stimulated the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) during the early stages of adipogenesis; however, this effect was eliminated by the SB203580 inhibitor. The data showed that YBS1 administration inhibited the initial development of adipocytes via stimulation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, which in turn controlled PPARγ expression. In summary, YBS1 has potential efficacy as an anti-obesity supplement and requires further exploration.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a highly aggressive form of oral cancer. Probiotic lactobacilli have demonstrated anticancer effects, whilst their interaction with Streptococcus mutans in this context remains unexplored. The objective of this study was to investigate the antiproliferative effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus on OSCC and to understand the effect of S mutans on OSCCs and whether it affects the antiproliferative potential of L acidophilus when co-exposed to OSCC. METHODS: The human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells of the oral cavity (HNO97 cell line) were exposed to cultures of L acidophilus and S mutans separately and in combination. Further, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed to assess the viability of HNO97 cells. Bacterial adhesion to HNO97 cells was examined by confocal microscopy and apoptosis by Nexin staining. To understand the underlying mechanism of apoptosis, expression of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) gene and protein were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. RESULTS: A significant decrease (53%-56%) in the viability of HNO97 cells on exposure to L acidophilus, S mutans, and the 2 species together demonstrated the antiproliferative activity of L acidophilus and S mutans. Both bacteria showed adhesion to HNO97 cells. The expression of the TRAIL gene increased 5-fold in HNO97 cells on treatment with L acidophilus and S mutans, which further increased to ∼17-fold with both species present. Expression levels of the TRAIL protein were significantly (P < .05) increased in bacteria-treated cell lysates. Further, bacteria-treated HNO97 cells exhibited lower live and intact cell percentages with higher proportions of cells in early and late apoptotic stages. CONCLUSIONS: L acidophilus exhibits the antiproliferative activity against OSCC cells possibly partially via a TRAIL-induced mechanism of apoptosis, which is not affected by the presence of S mutans. These findings may encourage further investigation into the possible therapeutic application of probiotic L acidophilus in OSCC.",

      "abstract": "The worldwide reduction in the use of antibiotics in animal feed is fueling the need for alternatives for the prevention and control of poultry intestinal diseases such as necrotic enteritis (NE), which is caused by Clostridium perfringens. This is the first report on the use of an intestinal epithelial chicken cell line (CHIC-8E11) to study the pathogenic traits of C. perfringens and to investigate the mode of action of cell-free supernatants (CFS) from probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus AG01 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis AG02 in reducing the pathogenicity of C. perfringens. The cell adhesion, permeability and cytotoxicity were assessed under challenge with four C. perfringens strains isolated from broiler NE episodes of differing geographical origin (CP1-UK; CP10-Sweden; 25037-CP01 and CP22-USA). All the C. perfringens strains could adhere to the CHIC-8E11 cells, with varying affinity (0.05-0.48% adhesion across the strains). The CFS from one out of two strains (CP22) increased the cell permeability (+4.5-fold vs. the control, p < 0.01), as measured by the fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FD4) content, with NetB toxin implicated in this effect. The CFS from all the strains was cytotoxic against the CHIC-8E11 cells in a dose- and strain-dependent manner (cytotoxicity 23-62% across the strains when dosed at 50 µL/mL, as assessed by the MTT cell viability assay). Pre-treatment of the cells with CFS from B. animalis subsp. lactis AG02 but not L. acidophilus AG01 reduced the cell adhesion of three out of four C. perfringens strains (by 77-85% vs. the control, p < 0.001) and reduced the negative effect of two NetB-positive strains on the cell permeability. The CFS of both probiotics alleviated the cytotoxicity of all the C. perfringens strains, which was dependent on the dose. The results confirm the suitability of the CHIC-8E11 cell line for the study of host-pathogen cell interactions in the context of NE caused by C. perfringens and reveal a beneficial mode of action of B. animalis subsp. lactis AG02 in reducing C. perfringens cell adhesion and, together with L. acidophilus AG01, in reducing C. perfringens cytotoxicity."

      "abstract": "Probiotics are defined as \"live microorganisms that provide health benefits to the host when administered in adequate amounts.\" Probiotics have beneficial effects on human health, including antibacterial activity against intestinal pathogens, regulation of blood cholesterol levels, reduction of colitis and inflammation incidence, regulation of the immune system, and prevention of colon cancer. In addition to probiotic bacteria, some phenolic compounds found in foods we consume (both food and beverages) have positive effects on human health. p-coumaric acid (p-CA) is one of the most abundant phenolic compounds in nature and human diet. The interactions between these two different food components (phenolics and probiotics), resulting in more beneficial combinations called synbiotics, are not well understood in terms of how they will affect the gut microbiota by promoting the probiotic properties and growth of probiotic bacteria. Thus, this study aimed to investigate synbiotic relationship between p-CA and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 (LA-5), Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG). Probiotic bacteria were grown in the presence of p-CA at different concentrations, and the effects of p-CA on probiotic properties, as well as its in vitro effects on AChE and BChE activities, were investigated. Additionally, Surface analysis was conducted using FTIR. The results showed that treatment with p-CA at different concentrations did not exhibit any inhibitory effect on the growth kinetics of LA-5 and LGG probiotic bacteria. Additionally, both probiotic bacteria demonstrated high levels of antibacterial properties. It showed that it increased the auto-aggregation of both probiotics. While p-CA increased co-aggregation of LA-5 and LGG against Escherichia coli, it decreased co-aggregation against Staphylococcus aureus. Probiotics grown with p-CA were more resistant to pepsin. While p-CA increased the resistance of LA-5 to bile salt, it decreased the resistance of LGG. The combinations of bacteria and p-CA efficiently suppressed AChE and BChE with inhibition (%) 11.04-68.43 and 13.20-65.72, respectively. Furthermore, surface analysis was conducted using FTIR to investigate the interaction of p-coumaric acid with LA-5 and LGG, and changes in cell components on the bacterial surface were analyzed. The results, recorded in range of 4000 -600 cm-1 with resolution of 4 cm-1, demonstrated that p-CA significantly affected only the phosphate/CH ratio for both bacteria. These results indicate the addition of p-CA to the probiotic growth may enhance the probiotic properties of bacteria.",

Forty-two female BALB/c inbred mice were divided into six groups: Group 1 (Control), Group 2 (Dox), Group 3 (Dox and probiotics), Group 4 (Dox and vitamin D3), Group 5 (Dox, probiotics, and vitamin D3), and Group 6 (probiotics and vitamin D3). The 4T1 mouse carcinoma cell line was injected into the mammary fat pad of each mouse. Gene expression was examined using quantitative real-time PCR. The treated groups (except group 6) showed significantly reduced tumor volume and weight compared to the control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Probiotics/vitamin D3 with Dox reduced chemotherapy toxicity and a combination of supplements had a significant protective effect against Dox (P < 0.05, 0.01, 0.001). The treated groups (except 6) had significantly higher expression of Bax/Caspase 3 genes and lower expression of Bcl-2 genes than the control group (P < 0.05, 0.01).

      "abstract": "In China, traditional medications for osteoporosis have significant side effects, low compliance, and high costs, making it urgent to explore new treatment options. Probiotics have demonstrated superiority in the treatment of various chronic diseases, and the reduction of bone mass in postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is closely related to the degradation and metabolism of intestinal probiotics. It is crucial to explore the role and molecular mechanisms of probiotics in alleviating PMOP through their metabolites, as well as their therapeutic effects. We aim to identify key probiotics and their metabolites that affect bone loss in PMOP through 16srDNA sequencing combined with non-targeted metabolomics sequencing, and explore the impact and possible mechanisms of key probiotics and their metabolites on the progression of PMOP in the context of osteoporosis caused by estrogen deficiency. The sequencing results showed a significant decrease in Lactobacillus acidophilus and butyrate in PMOP patients. In vivo experiments confirmed that the intervention of L. acidophilus and butyrate significantly inhibited osteoclast formation and bone resorption activity, improved intestinal barrier permeability, suppressed B cells, and the production of RANKL on B cells, effectively reduced systemic bone loss induced by oophorectomy, with butyric acid levels regulated by L. acidophilus. Consistently, in vitro experiments have confirmed that butyrate can directly inhibit the formation of osteoclasts and bone resorption activity. The above research results indicate that there are various pathways through which L. acidophilus inhibits osteoclast formation and bone resorption activity through butyrate. Intervention with L. acidophilus may be a safe and promising treatment strategy for osteoclast related bone diseases, such as PMOP.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial properties of different concentrations of bamboo shoot ethanol extract with chlorhexidine mouth rinse on isolates of salivary Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus). Materials and methods Non-stimulated salivary samples from 30 young adults were treated ex vivo with bamboo shoot ethanolic extract at concentrations of 30 µg/ml, 40 µg/ml, 50 µg/ml, and 60 µg/ml. The colony-forming units were quantified by measuring the number of viable bacterial cells. Inhibition zones were evaluated using the agar diffusion method. One-way ANOVA and post-hoc test were used to analyze the significant difference between variables using SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results The mean zone of inhibition with bamboo shoot ethanolic extract against salivary S. mutans (23.00 ± 0.816) and L. acidophilus (22.00 ± 0.816) total counts was closest to the control chlorhexidine (S. mutans = 22.00 ± 0.876 and L. acidophilus = 21.10 ± 0.876). A greater activity against S. mutans and L. acidophilus is seen in the zone of inhibition of the 60 µg/ml experimental concentration of bamboo shoot ethanolic extract, with a significant difference in the disc diffusion assay. Conclusion The treatment with bamboo shoot extract was equivalent effective in the mentioned bacterial species. Clinical relevance It can be assured that preventive measures like mouth rinse and dentifrices compromising bamboo shoots, a potential dental biomaterial, would be optimistic agents for caries control, including the cariostatic effect."

Oral administration of L. acidophilus KBL409 significantly reduced dermatitis scores and decreased infiltration of immune cells in skin tissues.

      "abstract": "Selenium is an essential trace element for most organisms, protecting cells from oxidative damage caused by free radicals and serving as an adjunctive treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this study, We used the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus HN23 to reduce tetra-valent sodium selenite into particulate matter, and analyzed it through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). We found that it consisted of selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) with a mass composition of 65.8 % zero-valent selenium and some polysaccharide and polypeptide compounds, with particle sizes ranging from 60 to 300 nm. We also detected that SeNPs were much less toxic to cells than selenite. We further used free fatty acids (FFA)-induced WRL68 fatty liver cell model to study the therapeutic effect of SeNPs on NAFLD. The results show that SeNPs are more effective than selenite in reducing lipid deposition, increasing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and antioxidant capacity of WRL68 cells, which is attributed to the chemical valence state of selenium and organic composition in SeNPs. In conclusion, SeNPs produced by probiotics L. acidophilus had the potential to alleviate NAFLD by reducing hepatocyte lipid deposition and oxidative damage. This study may open a new avenue for SeNPs drug development to treat NAFLD.",

      "abstract": "Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) is a common clinical probiotic that improves ulcerative colitis (UC) by restoring intestinal immune balance. However, the interaction of LA with the gut microbiota and its metabolites in the treatment of UC remains unknown. Therefore, this study seeks to elucidate whether the gut microbiota and its metabolites act as pivotal effectors in LA's therapeutic mechanisms and how precisely they modulate intestinal immunity. In this study, we verified that LA can obviously ameliorate the disease severity, and regulate intestinal immune disorders in UC mice. Subsequently, antibiotic (ABX)-mediated depletion of the gut microflora demonstrated that the therapeutic efficiency of LA was closely associated with gut microbiota. In addition, the results of metabolomics revealed that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a metabolite of intestinal flora, may be a potential effector molecule mediating therapeutic effects of LA. Indeed, we found that UDCA can improve the macro pathological characteristics of UC mice, and through a comprehensive set of in vivo and in vitro experiments, we discovered that UDCA exerts dual effects on immune regulation. Firstly, it promotes the differentiation of Treg cells, resulting in increased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Secondly, UDCA inhibits the polarization of M1 macrophages, effectively reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, we found that UDCA regulation of immune response is directly related to the RapGap/PI3K-AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway. In conclusion, LA and its metabolite, UDCA, may treat UC by activating the RapGap/PI3K-AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway and modulating Treg cells and M1 macrophages. All in all, our findings highlight the potential of microbial metabolites in enhancing probiotic for UC treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is the world's third most frequent cancer and the fourth cause of mortality. Probiotics play an important function in preventing metastasis as well as the growth and proliferation of malignant cancer cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study investigated the anticancer effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus supernatant and Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast on colorectal cell lines, including HT29 and SW480 as a colorectal cancer model. The extract from the Lactobacillus acidophilus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae standard probiotics were prepared, and probiotics characterization was confirmed by morphological and Biochemical tests. The viability of HT29 and SW480 colon cancer cell lines on effecting probiotic supernatant was evaluated by measuring the MTT colorimetric method. Comparison of the expression profile of several genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle, and metastatic pathway in HT29 and SW480 cell lines with the treatment of probiotics extract showed an upregulation in the BAX, CASP3, and CASP9 and down regulation BCl-2, MMP2, and MMP9 genes. Also, a comparison of microRNA expression profiles indicated an increase of miR 34, 135, 25, 16, 195, 27, 98, let7 and a decrease of miR 9, 106b, 17, 21, 155, 221. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION: The findings of this study indicate that probiotics can effectively suppress the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells and even reverse their development. Additionally, the study of cellular genes and miRNA profiles associated with colorectal cancer have demonstrated that our probiotics play a crucial role in CRC prevention by increasing the expression of tumor suppressor microRNAs and their target genes while decreasing oncogenes.",

Therefore, this study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the possibility of producing synbiotic yogurt sauce prepared with Spirulina platensis microalgae extract (SPAE) as a valuable and alternative product for mayonnaise. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After preparing yogurt from fresh cow's milk, synbiotic yogurt sauce was prepared according to the formulation, and the effect of SPAE at the rate of 0.5, 1, and 2% on the viability of the probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus was evaluated, and chemical, rheological, and sensory tests were carried out in the storage period (35 days). RESULTS: The highest viability rate of L. acidophilus was related to the treatment containing 2% of SPAE with 1.31 log CFU/g reduction (from 9.02 log CFU/g on the first day to 7.71 log CFU/g on the final day) and 1% of SPAE with 2.98 log CFU/g reduction, respectively, which were significantly more effective than other treatments (P < 0.05), and it was found that the viability rate increases with the increase in the percentage of the prebiotic composition. There was also a significant difference between the treatments in the simulating conditions of the digestive system, and the viability of L. acidophilus in the treatment containing the prebiotic composition increased (P < 0.05). According to the results, during storage, in the presence of microalgae, acidity increased, and pH, viscosity, and sensory properties decreased compared to the control group. Upon analyzing the results, it was found that the addition of the prebiotic composition of SPAE, which is known as a functional product, led to a partial improvement in its properties. Therefore, the use of this alga, while benefiting from its medicinal and therapeutic properties, increases the viability rate of probiotic.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent and life-threatening cancer closely associated with the gut microbiota. Probiotics, as a vital microbiota group, interact with the host's colonic epithelia and immune cells by releasing a diverse range of metabolites named postbiotics. The present study examined the effects of postbiotics on CRC's prominent differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using in silico and in vitro analysis. Through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identified four DEGs in CRC, including secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1), secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2), secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4), and matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7). Enrichment analysis and ExpiMap, a novel deep learning-based method, determined that these DEGs are involved in the Wnt signaling pathway as a primary cascade in CRC. Also, spatial transcriptome analysis showed specific expression patterns of the SFRP2 gene in fibroblast cell type. The expression of selected DEGs was confirmed on CRC and normal adjacent tissues using Real-Time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Moreover, we examined the effects of postbiotics extracted from Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) on the proliferation, migration, and cell cycle distribution of HT-29 cells using MTT, scratch, and flow cytometry assays. Our results showed that L. acidophilus postbiotics induce cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and also had anti-proliferative and anti-migration effects on HT-29 cells, while it did not exert anti-proliferative activity on control fibroblasts. Finally, we revealed that treating HT-29 cells with postbiotics can affect the expression of selected DEGs. We suggested that L. acidophilus postbiotics have therapeutic potential in CRC by modulating key genes in the Wnt pathway.",

Here, the therapeutic effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus)-fermented jujube juice (FJJ) and the possible mechanism against chronic liver injury (CLI) in mice are further studied. METHODS AND RESULTS: After the CCl4 -induced CLI mice are separately treated with L. acidophilus (LA), unfermented jujube juice (UFJJ), and FJJ, FJJ but not LA or UFJJ suppresses the liver index. By using H&E staining, immunofluorescence staining, RT-PCR, and western blotting, it is shown that LA, UFJJ, and FJJ intervention ameliorate hepatocyte necrosis, inhibit the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory (NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-1β, and TNF-α) and fibrosis-associated factors (TGF-β1, LXRα, and MMP2). Also, FJJ displays significant protection against mucosal barrier damage in CLI mice. Among the three interventions, FJJ exhibits the best therapeutic effect, followed by UFJJ and LA. Furthermore, FJJ improves dysbiosis in CLI mice. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that FJJ exhibits a protective effect against CCl4 -induced CLI mice by inhibiting apoptosis and oxidative stress, regulating liver lipid metabolism, and improving gut microecology. Jujube juice fermentation with L. acidophilus can be a food-grade supplement in treating CLI and related liver diseases.",

METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 80 children and adolescents with ADHD diagnosis, aged 6-16 years, were included. The participants were randomly assigned to two groups: one group received probiotics plus atomoxetine, whereas the other group received atomoxetine only. ADHD symptomatology was assessed using the Conners Parent Rating Scale-Revised Long Version (CPRS-R-L) and Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL/6-18). The participants were evaluated for their vigilance and executive function using Conner's Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and Wisconsin Card Sort Test (WCST). Both groups were assessed at the beginning of the study and the end of the twelve weeks. RESULTS: The probiotic group comprised 36 patients, whereas the control group comprised 40 patients in the final analysis after four patients dropped out of the trial. After 3 months of probiotic supplementation, a significant improvement in the CPRS-R-L and CBCL total T scores was observed compared with those in the control group (p = 0.032, 0.024, respectively). Additionally, the probiotic group demonstrated improved focus attention (target accuracy rate and omission errors;p = 0.02, 0.043, respectively) compared with the control group. An analysis of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) performance demonstrated that the probiotic group had significantly lower perseverative (p = 0.017) and non-perseverative errors (p = 0.044) but no significant differences compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus acidophilus LB supplementation combined with atomoxetine for 3 months had a beneficial impact on ADHD symptomology and a favorable influence on cognitive performance. As a result, the efficacy of probiotics as an adjunctive treatment for managing ADHD may be promising. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT04167995).

      "abstract": "Veillonella and Lactobacillus species are key regulators of a healthy gut environment through metabolic cross-feeding, influencing lactic acid and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels, which are crucial for gut health. This study aims to investigate how Veillonella ratti (V. ratti) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) interact with each other and alleviate dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in a mouse model. We assess their metabolic interactions regarding carbon sources through co-culturing in a modified medium. In the in vitro experiments, V. ratti and LA were inoculated in mono-cultures and co-culture, and viable cell counts, OD600, pH, lactic acid, glucose and SCFAs were measured. For the in vivo experiment, 60 C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into five groups and administered V. ratti and LA alone or in combination via oral gavage (1 × 109 CFU mL-1 per day per mouse) for 14 days. On the seventh day, 2.5% DSS was added to the drinking water to induce colitis. The effects of these probiotics on UC were evaluated by assessing intestinal barrier integrity and intestinal inflammation in the gut microenvironment. In vitro results demonstrated that co-culturing V. ratti with LA significantly increased viable cell numbers, lactic acid production, and SCFA production, while reducing pH and glucose levels in the medium. In vivo findings revealed that intervention with V. ratti, particularly in combination with LA, alleviated symptoms, including weight loss, colon shortening, and tissue damage. These probiotics mitigated intestinal inflammation by down-regulating pro-inflammatory molecules, such as IL-6, IL-1β, IL-γ, iNOS, and IFN-γ, as well as oxidative stress markers, including MDA and MPO. Concurrently, they upregulated the activity of anti-inflammatory enzymes, namely, SOD and GSH, and promoted the production of SCFAs. The combined intervention of V. ratti and LA significantly increased acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, and total SCFAs in cecal contents. Furthermore, the intervention of V. ratti and LA increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Akkermansia, while reducing the abundance of harmful bacteria, such as Escherichia-Shigella and Desulfovibrio, thereby mitigating excessive inflammation. These findings highlight the enhanced therapeutic effects resulting from the interactions between V. ratti and LA, demonstrating the potential of this combined probiotic approach.",

METHODS: A total of 30 SPF BALB/c male mice were randomly divided into control group(10) and model group(20). The model group was given ceftriaxone sodium solution by gavage for a week to create a mouse model of antibiotic flora disorder. The natural recovery group(10) was given 10% skimmed milk solution by gavage, and the LA11-Onlly group was given Lactobacillus acidophilus skimmed milk solution(1.0×10~9CFU/mL). Two weeks later, the feces were collected aseptically.16S rRNA sequencing technology and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry(UPLC-MS) were used to analyze the repair effect of LA11-Onlly on antibiotic induced bacterial flora disorder and lipid metabolism in mice. RESULTS: After ceftriaxone treatment, the diversity of intestinal microbiota in mice decreased, and there was a significant difference in the composition of flora compared with the control group; After treatment with LA11-Onlly, the Alpha diversity increased, the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Butyricicoccus increased, and the composition of flora was closer to the control group; At the same time, the concentration of short chain fatty acids(SCFAs) increased in varying degrees. Compared with the natural recovery group, the levels of butyric acid and valeric acid in LA11-Onlly group increased significantly, close to the same level as the control group. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus acidophilus LA11-Onlly probiotics can inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria by regulating the diversity and community composition of intestinal microbiota, promote the increase of the concentration of SCFAs, and alleviate the damage of antibiotics to the body.",

Among the LAB, Lactobacillus acidophilus is a species that deserves to be highlighted for being used both in prophylaxis and in the treatment of pathologies. Most of the metabolites produced by this species are linked to the inhibition of pathogens. In this study, we utilized a pangenomic and metabolic annotation analysis using Roary and BlastKOALA, ML-based probiotic activity prediction with iProbiotic and whole-genome similarity using ANI to identify strains of L. acidophilus with potential probiotic activity. According to the results in BlastKOALA and iProbiotics, L. acidophilus NCTC 13721 had the greatest potential among the 64 strains tested, both in terms of its ability to be a Lactobacillus spp. probiotic, when in the amount of genes involved in the metabolism of organic acids and quorum sensing. In addition, DSM 20079 proved to be promising for prospecting new probiotic Lactobacillus from BlastKOALA analyses, as they presented similar results in the number of genes involved in the production of lactic acid, acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, except for quorum sensing where the NCTC 13721 strain had 14 more genes. L. acidophilus NCTC 13721 and L. acidophilus La-5 strains showed greater ability to be Lactobacillus spp. probiotic capacity, showing 84.8% and 51.9% capacity in the iProbiotics tool, respectively. When analyzed in ANI, none of the evaluated strains showed genomic similarity with NCTC 13721. In contrast, the DSM 20079 strain showed genomic similarity with all evaluated strains except NCTC 13721. Furthermore, eight strains with characteristics with approximately 100% genomic similarity to La-5 were listed: S20_1, LA-5, FSI4, APC2845, LA-G80-111, DS1_1A, LA1, and BCRC 14065. Therefore, according to the findings in iProbiotics and BlastKoala, among the 64 strains evaluated, NCTC 13721 is the most promising strain to be used for future in vitro studies.",

      "abstract": "Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a recurrent condition that affects millions of women worldwide. The use of probiotics is a promising alternative or an adjunct to traditional antibiotics for BV prevention and treatment. However, current administration regimens often require daily administration, thus contributing to low user adherence and recurrence. Here, electrospun fibers were designed to separately incorporate and sustain two lactic acid producing model organisms, Lactobacillus crispatus (L. crispatus) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus). Fibers were made of polyethylene oxide and polylactic-co-glycolic acid in two different architectures, one with distinct layers and the other with co-spun components. Degradation of mesh and layered fibers was evaluated via mass loss and scanning electron microscopy. The results show that after 48 h and 6 days, cultures of mesh and layered fibers yielded as much as 108 and 109 CFU probiotic/mg fiber in total, respectively, with corresponding daily recovery on the order of 108 CFU/(mg·day). In addition, cultures of the fibers yielded lactic acid and caused a significant reduction in pH, indicating a high level of metabolic activity. The formulations did not affect vaginal keratinocyte viability or cell membrane integrity in vitro. Finally, mesh and layered probiotic fiber dosage forms demonstrated inhibition of Gardnerella, one of the most prevalent and abundant bacteria associated with BV, respectively resulting in 8- and 6.5-log decreases in Gardnerella viability in vitro after 24 h. This study provides initial proof of concept that mesh and layered electrospun fiber architectures developed as dissolving films may offer a viable alternative to daily probiotic administration.",

In this experiment, the mechanism for the effect of different metal ion pre-stress on the acid-tolerant survival of Lactobacillus was investigated. Scanning electron microscopy, Fourier infrared spectroscopy, and flow cytometry were used to analyze the condition of bacteria after acid treatment, which revealed that different metal ion pre-stress could improve the survival ability of Lactobacillus acidophilus CICC 6074 under low acid conditions by improving cell morphology, mitigating cell membrane damage, and regulating surface protein expression. Furthermore, Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) proteomic analysis revealed that Mn2+ pre-stress showed relatively more superior protective effects on acid tolerance in L. acidophilus CICC 6074 through activation of DNA replication, RNA synthesis, S-layer protein secretion, H+-ATPase enzyme activity, etc. This study will provide new ideas and a theoretical basis for the development and application of lactic acid bacteria.",

METHODS: Human gastric adenocarcinoma AGS cells were incubated with H. pylori and six probiotic strains (Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, L. acidophilus La-14, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Lp-115, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Lpc-37, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus Lr-32, and L. rhamnosus GG) and the adhesion ability of H. pylori in different combinations was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and urease activity assay. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into five groups (uninfected, H. pylori, H. pylori+NCFM, H. pylori+Lp-115, and H. pylori+NCFM+Lp-115) and treated with two lactobacilli strains (NCFM and Lp-115) for six weeks. H. pylori colonization and tissue inflammation statuses were determined by rapid urease test, Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining, immunohistochemistry, and qRT-PCR and ELISA. RESULTS: L. acidophilus NCFM, L. acidophilus La-14, L. plantarum Lp-115, L. paracasei Lpc-37, L. rhamnosus Lr-32, and L. rhamnosus GG reduced H. pylori adhesion and inflammation caused by H. pylori infection in AGS cells and mice. Among all probiotics L. acidophilus NCFM and L. plantarum, Lp-115 showed significant effects on the H. pylori eradication and reduction of inflammation in-vitro and in-vivo. Compared with the H. pylori infection group, the mRNA and protein expression levels of IL-8 and TNF-α in the six Lactobacillus intervention groups were significantly reduced. The changes in the urease activity (ureA and ureB) for 1-7h in each group showed that L. acidophilus NCFM, L. acidophilus La-14, L. plantarum Lp-115, and L. rhamnosus GG effectively reduced the colonization of H. pylori. We observed a higher ratio of lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration into the lamina propria of the gastric mucosa and neutrophil infiltration in H. pylori+NCFM+Lp-115 mice. The infiltration of inflammatory cells in lamina propria of the gastric mucosa was reduced in the H. pylori+NCFM+Lp-115 group. Additionally, the expression of IFN-γ was decreased significantly in the NCFM and Lp-115 treated C57BL/6 mice. CONCLUSIONS: L. acidophilus NCFM and L. plantarum Lp-115 can reduce the adhesion of H. pylori and inhibit the gastric inflammatory response caused by H. pylori infection.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third cause of death by cancers worldwide and is one of the most common cancer types reported in both Egypt and the United States. The use of probiotics as a dietary therapy is increasing either as a prevention or as a treatment for many diseases, particularly, in the case of CRC. The increasing acceptance of lactic acid bacterial (LAB) oligosaccharides as bioactive agents has led to an increase in the demand for the large-scale production of LAB-oligosaccharides using fermentation technology. Therefore, in the current study, we are using the Plackett- Burman design (PBD) approach, where sixteen experimental trials were applied to optimize the production of the target oligosaccharide LA-EPS-20079 from Lactobacillus acidophilus. Glucose, yeast extract and sodium acetate trihydrate were the top three significant variables influencing LA-EPS production. The maximum concentration of LA-EPS-20079 achieved by L. acidophilus was 526.79 μg/ml. Furthermore, Box-Behnken design (BBD) as response surface methodology (RSM) was used to complete the optimization procedure. The optimal levels of the chosen variables which were 30.0 g/l, glucose; 5 g/l, yeast extract and 10.0 g/l sodium acetate trihydrate with the predicted LA-EPS-20079 concentration of 794.82 μg/ml. Model validity reached 99.93% when the results were verified. Both optimized trials showed great cytotoxic effects against colon cancer line (CaCo-2) with inhibition percentages ranging from 64.6 to 81.9%. Moreover, downregulation in the expression level of BCL2 and Survivin genes was found with a fold change of 3.377 and 21.38, respectively. Finally, we concluded that the optimized LA-EPS-20079 has maintained its anticancer effect against the CaCo-2 cell line that was previously reported by our research group.",

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease associated with immune system dysfunction caused by gut dysbiosis. This study aimed to investigate the alleviating effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus LA85 on colitis and its underlying mechanism using mouse models of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC. The UC mouse models were established by treating C57BL/6J male mice with 2.5% (w/v) DSS in drinking water for 7 days. These mice received supplementation with either L. acidophilus LA85 (1 × 109 colony-forming units/day) or 200 µL of sterile water once daily (LA85-treated and UC model mice, respectively). The disease activity index (DAI), colon length, and histological changes in the colons of mice were then analyzed at Day 21, and the effects of L. acidophilus LA85 on the gut microbiota and serum inflammatory cytokines were also investigated. Compared with the UC model mice, L. acidophilus LA85-treated UC mice showed significant reductions in a variety of colitis symptoms, including weight loss, the DAI score, colon shortening, and colon tissue damage. Lactobacillus acidophilus LA85 supplementation also significantly decreased the serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-6 while increasing the serum concentration of IL-10. Furthermore, LA85 supplementation improved the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota, both of which had been decreased by DSS. In particular, L. acidophilus LA85-treated UC mice showed higher relative abundances of Akkermansia and Romboutsia than the UC model mice. These results demonstrate that L. acidophilus LA85 can alleviate inflammatory diseases of the intestine, such as inflammatory bowel disease, by regulating immune responses and restoring the gut microbiota. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease caused by imbalance of gut microbiota. This study showed that L. acidophilus LA85 can alleviate DSS-induced colitis in mice through regulation of inflammatory cytokines, protection of intestinal barrier, and regulation of specific gut microbiota. L. acidophilus LA85 is a promising probiotic candidate for the treatment of UC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a highly prevalent illness affecting women globally. Lactobacilli, which make up the majority of healthy vaginal microbiota (VMB), serve as a powerful barrier against infections. Probiotic therapy has been recommended for the treatment or prevention of VVC. AIM OF WORK: To compare the in vivo therapeutic effects of Lactobacillus johnsonii (B-2178) vs. Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA-5®) on VVC in a rat model, particularly highlighting the immune response of the host vaginal epithelium. METHODS: In total, 30 female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups; Group 1: no intervention, Group 2: ovariectomy group, while animals in Groups 3-5 were subjected to ovariectomy and an intravaginal inoculation of Candida albicans (C. albicans) to establish VVC. The animals in Groups 4 and 5 received intravaginal lactobacilli treatment with L. acidophilus (LA-5®) and L. johnsonii (B-2178) strains, respectively, for 7 days. C. albicans load was measured in a vaginal lavage 1, 3, and 7 days after the stoppage of the treatment. Histological, morphometric, and immunohistochemical studies of the vaginal tissues were done. IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-17 were measured in the vaginal tissue. RESULTS: Both L. johnsonii and L. acidophilus significantly reduced C. albicans vaginal load (250 ± 77.46 and 133.33 ± 40.82 CFU/mL) compared to the count before treatment in both groups (4,850 ± 1419.51 and 4966.67 ± 852.45 CFU/mL) even after 7 days of stoppage of lactobacilli treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IFN-γ was reported in both treated groups compared to the infected untreated group. L. johnsonii has a significant effect on the reduction of hyphae formation of C. albicans as well as the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) immunostaining density of vaginal tissue compared to L. acidophilus. Moreover, treatment with L. johnsonii significantly minimized the epithelium damage triggered by C. albicans infection and restored normal vaginal architecture as evidenced by the histologic and morphometric studies when compared to L. acidophilus. CONCLUSION: Through maintaining an immune tolerant state in the vaginal epithelium and ameliorating the undesirable uncontrolled inflammatory response in the vaginal tissue, L. johnsonii (B-2178) has the potential to be utilized alone or in combination with other lactobacilli species in probiotic clinical trials to treat or prevent VVC."

Five groups of female inbred BALB/c mice were orally administered with the probiotics and their mixes (MIX, at a 1:1 ratio) at varying dosages (1.5 × 108 cfu/ml and 1.2 × 109 cfu/ml) before and after the injection of a subcutaneous CT26 tumor over the course of 38 days via gavage. Finally, their effects on the tumor apoptosis and the cytokine levels in spleen cell cultures were analyzed and compared. M11, MIX, and 52b groups had the greatest levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production. The highest production level of granzyme B (GrB) was related to the MIX and 52b groups. Moreover, these groups showed the lowest production level of (IL-4) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). Furthermore, the groups of MIX and 52b demonstrated the greatest amount of lymphocyte proliferation of spleen cells in response to the tumor antigen. The delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response significantly increased in the groups of MIX and 52b compared with the control (p < 0.05). The findings demonstrated that the oral treatment of the human strain (52b) and the combination of these bacteria generated strong T helper type 1 (Th1) immune responses in the tumor tissue of the tumor-bearing mice, which led to the suppression of the tumor development.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), in which standardized cedar pollen extract solution is administered, has been used to treat cedar pollinosis, but SLIT is problematic because it takes a long time to become effective, and some cases are ineffective even after long-term treatment. It has also been reported that lactobacillus acidophilus extract (LEX), a food-derived ingredient, alleviates various allergic symptoms. This study examined the usefulness of LEX as a treatment for cedar pollinosis in comparison with SLIT. We also examined whether the combined use of SLIT and LEX could have an early-onset of therapeutic effect on cedar pollinosis. We also examined the usefulness of LEX as a salvage therapy for patients who failed to respond to SLIT. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with cedar pollinosis were divided into three groups. The three groups were: three patients in the standardized cedar pollen extract group (S group), seven patients in the lactobacillus-producing extract group (L group), and five patients in the combination group of standardized cedar pollen extract and lactobacillus-producing extract (SL group). The subjects were treated for three years, corresponding to the three scattering seasons of cedar pollen, and observed according to the evaluation items. The evaluation items were severity score based on examination findings, subjective symptom score (QOL score) based on the Japanese Standard QOL Questionnaire for Allergic Rhinitis (JRQLQ No. 1) questionnaire, nonspecific IgE level measurement by blood test, and cedar pollen-specific IgE level measurement. RESULTS: After three years of observation, there were no significant differences in severity score and nonspecific IgE levels among the three groups, while QOL score decreased significantly between the first and third years of treatment in the L group. Cedar pollen-specific IgE levels in the S and SL groups showed an increase in the first year and a gradual decrease in the second and third years of treatment compared to the pre-treatment period. In group L, no increase was observed in the first year, and a significant decrease was observed in the second and third years during the cedar pollen dispersal period. CONCLUSIONS: The results of severity and quality of life scores indicated that it took three years of treatment for the S and SL groups to show efficacy, while the L group showed improvement in quality of life scores and cedar pollen-specific IgE levels from the first year, suggesting that LEX is useful as a treatment for cedar pollinosis. The efficacy of combination therapy with SLIT and LEX was not clear, but since the effect of LEX was observed from the early stage of treatment, it was thought that the combination therapy with LEX intake from the early stage of treatment may be effective in reducing the incidence of ineffective cases. The combination therapy of SLIT and LEX may also be useful as a salvage therapy."

Despite oxidative stress and inflammation being the most embedded mechanism of injury, pharmacological agents that exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory impacts could prevent such toxicities. This study aimed to assess the enteroprotective effect of lactobacillus acidophilus (LB) and/or umbelliferone (UMB) against MTX-induced intestinal injury. Histologically, pretreatment with LB, UMB, or their combinations preserve the intestinal histological structure and mucin content with superior effect in combination therapy. In addition, oral pretreatment with UMB, LB, or their combinations significantly restored oxidant/antioxidant status, as evidenced by the upregulation of Nrf2, SOD3, HO-1, GSH, and GST levels concurrent with a decline in MDA contents. Besides, they suppressed the inflammatory burden by inhibiting STAT3, MPO, TLR4, NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels. Moreover, LB, UMB, or their combinations significantly upregulated Wnt and β-catenin expression. Notably, pretreatment with the combination therapy is superior to monotherapy in protecting rats' small intestines from MTX-induced enteritis. In conclusion, combined pretreatment with LB and UMB could be a novel therapeutic regimen for conditions of intestinal injury induced by MTX via restoring oxidant/antioxidant balance and suppressing inflammatory burden.",

In the present study, Lactobacillus acidophilus C4 with high acid and bile salt resistance has been isolated and screened, and the beneficial effect of L. acidophilus C4 on Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice has been evaluated. Our data showed that oral administration of L. acidophilus C4 remarkably alleviated colitis symptoms in mice and minimized colon tissue damage. METHODS: To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we have investigated the levels of inflammatory cytokines and intestinal tight junction (TJ) related proteins (occludin and ZO-1) in colon tissue, as well as the intestinal microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in feces. RESULTS: Compared to the DSS group, the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in L. acidophilus C4 group were reduced, while the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and catalase (CAT) were found to be elevated. In addition, proteins linked to TJ were elevated after L. acidophilus C4 intervention. Further study revealed that L. acidophilus C4 reversed the decrease in intestinal microbiota diversity caused by colitis and promoted the levels of SCFAs. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrate that L. acidophilus C4 effectively alleviated DSS-induced colitis in mice by repairing the mucosal barrier and maintaining the intestinal microecological balance. L. acidophilus C4 could be of great potential for colitis therapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Isoflavones and probiotics are two major factors involved in bone health. Osteoporosis and disturbances in iron (Fe) levels are common health problems in aging women. This study aimed to analyze how soybean products, daidzein, genistein, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) affect Fe status and blood morphological parameters in healthy female rats. METHODS: A total of 48 Wistar rats aged 3 months were randomly divided into six groups. The control group (K) received a standard diet (AIN 93 M). The remaining five groups received a standard diet supplemented with the following: tempeh flour (TP); soy flour (RS); daidzein and genistein (DG); Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM20079 (LA); as well as a combination of daidzein, genistein, and L. acidophilus DSM20079 (DGLA). After 8 weeks of intervention, blood samples of the rats were collected for morphological analysis, whereas tissue samples were collected and kept at -80 °C until Fe analysis. Red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, platelets (PLTs), red cell distribution width, white blood cells, neutrophils (NEUT), lymphocytes (LYM), monocytes, eosinophils (EOS), and basophils were measured for blood morphological analysis. Fe concentrations were determined using flame atomic spectrometry. For statistical analysis, an ANOVA test for significance at the 5 % level was used. The relationship between tissue Fe levels and blood morphological parameters was determined using Pearson's correlation. RESULTS: Although no significant differences were observed in the Fe content between all diets, the TP group showed significantly higher levels of NEUT and lower levels of LYM than the control group. Compared with the DG and DGLA groups, the TP group showed a dramatically higher PLT level. In addition, the RS group showed significantly higher Fe concentrations in the spleen compared with the standard diet. Compared with the DG, LA, and DGLA groups, the RS group also showed significantly higher Fe concentrations in the liver. Compared with the TP, DG, LA, and DGLA groups, the RS group showed dramatically higher Fe concentrations in the femur. Pearson's correlations between blood morphological parameters and Fe levels in tissues were observed, especially a negative correlation between the Fe level in the femur and the NEUT concentration (-0.465) and a strong positive correlation between the Fe level in the femur and the LYM concentration (0.533). CONCLUSION: Soybean flour was found to increase Fe levels in rats, whereas tempeh may alter anti-inflammatory blood parameters. Isoflavones and probiotics did not affect Fe status in healthy female rats.",

      "abstract": "Reputed as a significant metabolic disorder, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by high-fat deposits in the liver and causes substantial economic challenges to any country's workforce. Previous studies have indicated that some lactic acid bacteria may effectively prevent or treat NAFLD. Overall, L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 protected against HFD-induced NAFLD by improving liver characteristics and modulating microbiota composition, and thus could be a candidate for improving NAFLD. This study aimed to assess the protective effects of L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 on a high-fat diet(HFD)-induced NAFLD. First, hepatic lipid profile and histological alterations were determined to study whether L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 could ameliorate NAFLD. Then, the intestinal permeability and gut barrier were explored. Finally, gut microbiota was analyzed to elucidate the mechanism from the insights of the gut-liver axis. The results showed that Lactobacillus KLDS1.0901 administration significantly decreased body weight, Lee's index body, fat rate, and liver index. L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 administration significantly improved lipid profiles by decreasing the hepatic levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and by increasing the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. A conspicuous decrease of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in serum was observed after L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 administration. Meanwhile, the H&E and Oil Red O-stained staining showed that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 significantly reduced liver lipid accumulation of HFD-fed mice by decreasing the NAS score and lipid area per total area. Our results showed that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 administration decreased the interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) concentrations accompanied by the increase of interleukin-10 (IL-10). L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 administration could improve the intestinal barrier function by upregulating the mRNA levels of occludin, claudin-1, ZO-1, and Muc-2, which were coupled to the decreases of the concentration of LPS and D-lactic acid. Notably, L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 administration modulated the gut microbiota to a near-normal pattern. Hence, our results suggested that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 can be used as a candidate to ameliorate NAFLD."

Synbiotic microgels crosslinked using 8 % AlCl3 (SPI/NaCMC-Al3+8 microgels) showed the highest encapsulation efficiency (92 %). The double-crosslinked microgels exhibited a smooth surface as proved by SEM. FT-IR, XRD, and DSC analyses showed the possible interaction within matrices and demonstrated the higher thermal stability of synbiotic microgels prepared using a higher concentration of AlCl3. All in all, after exposure to simulated digestion fluid, heat treatment (72 °C, 15 s), and refrigerated storage, more cells in double-crosslinked microgels survived compared to single-crosslinked microgels. In particular, probiotic viability was highest in SPI/NaCMC-Al3+8 microgels.

      "abstract": "AIM: One of the rapidly rising global public health concern is obesity. Over the past three decades, the prevalence of obesity has doubled/tripled in several nations around the world, most likely as a result of urbanization, sedentary lifestyles, and increased intake of high-calorie processed foods. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus administration on rats exposed to high-fat diet experimentally on anorexigenic peptides in the brain and some biochemical parameters in the serum. METHODS: In the study, 4 different experimental groups were formed. Group 1 was designated as the control group and fed with a standard rat chow (SD). Group 2 was designated as the high-fat diet (HFD) fed group. Group 3 fed with SD and L. acidophilus probiotic administered. Group 4 fed with HFD and L. acidophilus probiotic administered. At the end of the experiment, leptin, serotonin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels were measured in the brain tissue and serum. Glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), total protein (TP), albumin, uric acid, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were determined in the serum. RESULTS: At the end of the study, it was found that there was an increase in body weight and body mass index in Group 2 compared to Group 1. It was determined that the levels of AST, ALT, TG, TC, glucose, leptin in the serum were significantly high (P < 0.05). The levels of GLP-1 and serotonin in the serum and in the brain were significantly low (P < 0.05). There was a significant decrease in TG and TC in Groups 3 and 4 compared to Group 2 (P < 0.05). The leptin hormone levels in serum and brain were significantly higher in Group 2 than in other groups (P < 0.05). GLP-1 and serotonin levels were found to be significantly low (P < 0.05). The leptin levels in the serum of Groups 3 and 4 decreased significantly compared to Group 2 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: It was found that probiotic supplementation in high-fat diet had positive effects on anorexigenic peptides. It was concluded that L. acidophilus probiotic can be recommended as a food supplement in the treatment of obesity.",

METHODS: In the study, 5 experimental groups were formed. Group 1 was fed with standard rat chow, and Group 2 was fed with 2% cholesterol added standard rat chow for 8 weeks. Group 3 was fed with 2% cholesterol feed and received atorvastatin (20 mg/kg/day) for the last 4 weeks. Group 4 was given L. acidophilus (2 ×108 cfu/kg/day). Group 5 was given atorvastatin and L. acidophilus probiotic in the last 4 weeks of the experiment period. After the experimental period, blood samples were taken from each rat. Rats were sacrificed and brain tissues were taken for analyzes. In sera samples, leptin, ghrelin, insulin, serotonin hormones and NO levels were measured with ELISA. In brain samples, cannabinoid 1 receptor proteins and apoptosis levels were measured by ELISA. Total oxidant and antioxidant levels were investigated with using Rel Assay Kits. RESULTS: The addition of cholesterol to feeds increased the levels of serum cholesterol, insulin and leptin levels; on the other hand, reduced the levels of serotonin and ghrelin. In hypercholesterolemia, total oxidant and NO levels were increased, and total antioxidant levels were decreased. CONCLUSION: The results showed that administrations of L. acidophilus and atorvastatin might be recommended for treatment of hypercholesterolemia.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Probiotics are known to play a beneficial role in curing irritable bowel syndrome such as ulcerative colitis. Commensal Lactobacillus species are thought to play a protective role against ulcerative colitis, as they restore homeostasis in intestinal disorders. Abnormal serotonin availability has been described in ulcerative colitis, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the anti-inflammatory role of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) and its effect on serotonin expression. METHODS: Ulcerative colitis was created with the intrarectal administration of acetic acid. A total of 40 adult male rats were divided into five groups of eight rats as control, sham, experimental colitis, treatment (Colitis + L. acidophilus) and protective group (L. acidophilus + colitis). To evaluate the effects of L. acidophilus on serotonin expression in ulcerative colitis, this bacterial strain was administered orally to the rats with acetic acid-induced colitis. After oral administration of L. acidophilus for 14 days, serotonin content was biochemically measured and serotonin expression was evaluated immunohistochemically. RESULTS: The expression of serotonin and its protein content was significantly increased in colitis compared to the control and sham groups. Abnormal serotonin availability in the rats with acetic acid-induced colitis was significantly reduced by the L. acidophilus. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, it was observed that the amount of serotonin in the intestinal tissue increased excessively with ulcerative colitis. In addition, L.acidophilus has been found to reduce the abnormally increased amount of serotonin in the colon tissue, as well as reduce the inflammation in the intestinal tissue that occurs with ulcerative colitis. With our findings, it is predicted that probiotic application can be used as a treatment option in ulcerative colitis.",

We found that the fermentation solution (FS) intervention improved the calcium absorption, BMD, and bone microarchitecture in osteoporotic rats and resulted in better inhibition of osteoclast differentiation markers ACP-5 and pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 and promotion of osteoblast differentiation marker OCN. This better performance may be due to the improved restoration of the relative abundance of specific bacteria associated with improved calcium absorption and osteoporosis such as Lactobacillus, Allobaculum, and UCG-005. Several key metabolites, including indicaxanthin, chlorogenic acid, and 3-hydroxymelatonin, may also be the key to the better improvement. In conclusion, the LA fermenting APS can better improve calcium absorption and osteoporosis by increasing active metabolites and altering gut microbiota. This finding should become a solid foundation for the development of LA fermenting APS in functional foods."

Investigation of cerium nitrate in culture medium containing inoculated Lactobacillus acidophilus strain before incubation produces nano-series. Loaded with glatiramer acetate (GA) was formed by coating carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and CeO2. FE-SEM analysis showed nano-series in the 9-11 nm range, spherical shape, and uniform particle size distribution.

Peripheral blood monocytes cells (PBMCs) may have altered function to some extent in women with endometriosis. Lactobacillus acidophilus is a probiotic bacterium within the human body with the ability of alleviating many inflammatory diseases. Here, we examined the effect of L. acidophilus on PBMCs of endometriosis patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, peripheral blood samples were obtained from endometriosis patients (n=11) and non-endometriosis individuals (n=11). After isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with Ficoll, cells were cultured in the presence and absence of phytohemagglutinin. Also, these cells were co-cultured with 1×106 CFU/ml of L. acidophilus. IL-6 and IL-1 cytokines were measured by ELISA method and the two groups were evaluated and compared. RESULTS: The results showed that in endometriosis patients, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1 and IL-6, by PBMC was increased compared to non-endometriosis subjects, and stimuli such as PHA intensified this elevation. Also, L. acidophilus increased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1 and IL-6. However, the production of these cytokines decreased due to the modulatory properties of bacterial cells after 48 h. CONCLUSION: According to the results of the current study, IL-1 and IL-6 production was significantly increased in PMBCs of endometriosis patients compared to that of the healthy controls. Also, Lactobacillus acidophilus was considered as an antigenic compound and induced IL-1 and IL-6 production. According to these results, probiotics can be further used for the treatment of endometriosis patients and more investigations are needed to confirm these results."

Fecal samples were collected from the pen floors over a 5-month period at three different feedlots in a similar geographical location in Nebraska, where each feed yard represented a treatment group: (i.) control: no supplement, (ii.) Bovamine Defend: supplemented with NP51 and NP24 at a target dose of 9 log10CFU/g/head/day, and (iii.) Probicon: supplemented with L28 at a target dose of 6 log10CFU/g/head/day. Each fecal sample was tested for the prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella, and concentration of E. coli O157:H7, Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium perfringens. Cattle were harvested and PLNs were collected on the harvest floor. Real-time Salmonella PCR assays were performed for each PLN sample to determine Salmonella presence. The cattle supplemented with both DFMs had reduced foodborne pathogens in fecal samples, but feces collected from the pens housing the cattle supplemented with Probicon consistently had significantly less E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella prevalence as well as a lower C. perfringens concentration. While DFMs do not eliminate foodborne pathogens in fecal shedding and PLNs, the use of DFMs as a pre-harvest intervention allows for an effective way to target multiple pathogens reducing the public health risks and environmental dissemination from cattle."

Therefore, this work evaluated the effect of the incorporation of Lactobacillus acidophilus (probiotic) and inulin (prebiotic) in the diet through obesity markers (biochemical, anthropometric, and molecular markers) in an obese murine model. Four treatments were administered: (1) hypocaloric diet (HD), (2) HD + L. acidophilus, (3) HD + inulin, and (4) DH supplemented with L. acidophilus + inulin for 8 weeks. After treatment, glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C, and LDL-C in plasma were determined. In addition, the total body weight and adipose tissue were taken to calculate the body mass index. Following RNA extraction from adipose tissue, the expression of PPAR gamma, PPAR alpha, and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF1β) was evaluated by semiquantitative PCR. All treatments showed an improvement in biochemical markers compared to the values of the obese model (p < 0.05). Optimal values for blood glucose (133.2 ± 14.3 mg/dL), triglycerides (71 ± 4.6 mg/dL), total cholesterol (48.9 ± 6 mg/dL), HDL-C (40.9 ± 4.8 mg/dL), and LDL-C (8.4 ± 1.7 mg/dL) were obtained in the mixed treatment. Regarding fat mass index (FMI), prebiotic treatment caused the greatest reduction. On the other hand, mixed treatment increased the gene expression of PPARα and TGF1β in adipose tissue with DH with L. acidophilus and inulin treatment. This work demonstrates that the use of L. acidophilus and inulin as a complementary treatment is a viable alternative for prevention and action as a complementary treatment for obesity given the reduction in biochemical parameters and anthropometric indices; these reductions were greater than those found in the classic treatment of obesity due to the induction of the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism and anti-inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to reducing the high levels of glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol caused by obesity.",

Potential associations between the effects of probiotics on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury and gut microbiome patterns as well as the serum levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, lipopolysaccharide, and short chain fatty acids were also studied. Intragastric administration of lyophilized Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis at a dose of 1.2 × 108 CFU/mL for 15 days resulted in myocardial infarct size reduction in rats with DIO, CIC, and antibiotic-induced dysbiosis. This cardioprotective effect was associated with specific changes in cytokine concentrations, namely reduced levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-2, and IL-8. At the same time, the use of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis was accompanied by a significant reduction in lipopolysaccharide level, suggesting normalization of intestinal epithelial barrier permeability. However, the cardioprotective effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis is not secondary to improved healing of the intestinal mucosa in CIC, as evidenced by the lack of difference in histopathological scores."

      "abstract": "Colchicine (COL) is a permeability-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate drug used for familial Mediterranean fever, acute pericarditis, and the management of acute gout. It has a narrow therapeutic index which implies that a small change in the drug's absorption profile may lead to either toxicity or therapeutic failure. Absorption can be altered by modulating the function of P-gp via the concomitant use of drugs, herbal medicines, or food supplements such as probiotics. Here, we investigated the effect of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus BIOTECH 1900 on COL's transepithelial mucosal-to-serosal transport in the jejunum of ICR mice. A high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array (HPLC-PDA) method for the assay of COL was developed and validated. The HPLC-PDA method was applied in an ex vivo non-everted gut sac model to measure COL's cumulative mucosal-to-serosal transport and apparent permeability (Papp). Treatment of L. acidophilus BIOTECH 1900 resulted to a significantly lower COL transport and Papp value compared to the control group. Additionally, the activity of L. acidophilus BIOTECH 1900 was found to be similar to dexamethasone, a known P-gp inducer. We report that L. acidophilus BIOTECH 1900 decreases the transepithelial mucosal-to-serosal transport of COL, suggesting possible P-gp induction. Further studies are recommended to substantiate this transporter-based drug-probiotic interaction.",

Aims: This study aimed to assess the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCUF202.2 fermentation on Artemisia selengensis Turcz (AST) in relieving hyperuricemia (HUA) and the mechanisms involved. Results: The fermented Artemisia selengensis Turcz extracts (FASTE) could significantly increase the content of free polyphenol and enhance the inhibitory effect on xanthine oxidase (XOD) in vitro. The result of ultrafiltration coupled with UPLC-MS/MS screened out the components that might be combined with XOD in the caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs) of Artemisia selengensis Turcz extracts (ASTE) as 5-CQA, 3-CQA, 4-CQA, 1-CQA, 3,4-diCQA, 3,5-diCQA, 1,5-diCQA and 4,5-diCQA as well as caffeic acid (CA) of FASTE except the above. Our results also showed that ASTE and FASTE could alleviate HUA in rats. In contrast, FASTE had a better ability to reduce serum adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity than ASTE. Furthermore, FASTE could restore catalase (CAT) in HUA model rats in vivo, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity to a better degree, thereby inhibiting the production of excess malondialdehyde (MDA). Under the intervention of ASTE and FASTE, the levels of serum pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors in rats tended to be normal. However, FASTE could increase the expression of the uric acid secretion protein OAT1 and decrease the expression of reabsorption proteins URAT1 and GLUT9 in model rats, thereby reducing the serum uric acid (SUA) level in model rats. ASTE and FASTE can increase the abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium and Akkermansiaceae. Conclusion: Overall, part of diCQAs and CQAs was decomposed after fermentation. FASTE had a more substantial HUA-relieving effect than ASTE. It is expected to be applied to functional foods and contribute to the research and development of uric acid lowering functional foods.",

Fresh C. rotundifolia was treated without any additive (CK), or with L (106 CFU/g fresh weight), different levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1% fresh weight) of organic acid (malic or citric acid), and the combinations of L and the different levels of organic acids for 30, 45, and 60 days of ensiling. The effects of malic acid and citric acid were similar during the ensiling process. Treatment with either citric or malic acid and also when combined with L inhibited crude protein degradation, lowered pH and ammonia nitrogen, and increased lactic acid concentration and dry matter content (p < 0.05). The neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber increased initially and then decreased with fermentation time in all treatments (p < 0.05). Increasing the level of organic acid positively affected the chemical composition of C. rotundifolia silage. In addition, the addition of 1% organic acid increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, while the relative abundances of Clostridium and Enterobacter decreased at 60 days (p < 0.05). Moreover, both organic acids and combined additives increased (p < 0.05) the relative abundance of Cyanobacteria at 60 days of fermentation. We concluded that adding malic acid, citric acid, and L combined with an organic acid could improve the quality of C. rotundifolia silage and increase the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria. The addition of organic acid at a level of 1% was the most effective."

Both TG were treated with Flogostop Duo (for 20 days-TG1 or 30 days-TG2) in combination with the standard treatment, while CG underwent standard treatment only. The standard treatment was nasal aerosol with Fluticasone and Mucolytic, and nasal washing with hypertonic solution. All patients were analyzed by otoscopy, impedance, fibroscopy, and pure auditory test at the baseline (T0), after 20 days (T1) and 35 days (T2). 120 children were included in the study, 40 in the CG, 40 in the TG1, and 40 in the TG2. Both TG1 and TG2 presented statistically significant differences with respect to controls in otoscopy, impedance, fibroscopy, and PTA at T2. The otoscopy improved at T2 with statistically significant value only in TG2. The impedance and fibroscopy improved at T1 both in TG1 and TG2 compared to CG. A statistically significant improvement was observed in TG2 at T2 in comparison to both CG and TG1. Statistically significant differences were observed in PTA at T2 only compared with controls. This study confirmed the efficacy of nutraceutical as supporting therapy in the upper respiratory tract infection in children. In particular, the supplement containing Boswellia serrata and Bromelain, which are molecules with strong anti-inflammatory and pain-control capacities, could add the benefit without the adverse effects which are related to NSAID use."

Six diets were formulated: three diets without L. acidophilus containining 0 (control, ME0), 2.5 (ME2.5), and 5.0 g/kg of moringa (ME5.0) and the same three diets containing L. acidophilus at 1 × 107 CFU/g of diet (ME0+P, ME2.5 + P, and ME5.0 + P, respectively). Growth performance was measured after 60 days of the rearing period. On the final day, the shrimp were sampled to assess enzyme activity, intestinal and hepatopancreatic histology, and gut microbiota. Shrimp hemocytes were examined on Days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 to measure the immune response in terms of the total hemocyte count, phenoloxidase activity, phagocytosis, and superoxide anion production. Furthermore, the shrimp were challenged with V. alginolyticus and V. parahaemolyticus. The results revealed that ME2.5 + P significantly increased (P < 0.05) final weight, weight gain, specific growth rate, enzyme activities, and villi height compared with ME2.5 and control. Wall thickness was increased in the shrimp fed diet supplemented with moringa and L. acidophilus compared with the control shrimp. Hepatopancreatic histology revealed that R cells were more abundant in the shrimp fed diet containing moringa and L. acidophilus compared with those fed diet containing moringa alone (P < 0.05) at the same concentration. High-throughput sequencing analysis indicated that the dietary supplementation with moringa and L. acidophilus affected the gut microbiota composition. All gene functions, members of KEGG level 2, related to metabolism were increased in diet supplemented with moringa with or without L. acidophilus compared with the control group. The immune assay revealed that the total hemocyte count, phenoloxidase activity, phagocytic rate, superoxide anion production, and immune-related gene expression (including those of prophenoloxidase II, alpha-2-macroglobulin, penaeidin2, antilipopolysaccharide factor, crustin, lysozyme, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase) were higher in the experimental groups than in the control group on several observed days; however, the increases were observed more often in the ME2.5 + P group than in the other treatment groups. Furthermore, the ME2.5 + P group exhibited a significantly higher survival rate (P < 0.05) in the challenge test against V. alginolyticus and V. parahaemolyticus. In conclusion, supplementation with dietary moringa and L. acidophilus at ME2.5 + P improved growth performance, immune system, and resistance against Vibrio in the shrimp.",

After the formation of biofilm was observed in the monolayer bacterial culture under several conditions, the enzymatic treatment and nucleic acid quantification were sequentially performed. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:  Independent t-test and Mann-Whitney were performed following data normality to analyze the significant differences of the treatment effect on the nucleic acid concentration in EPS from the isolated biofilm. RESULTS:  The results showed that the nucleic acid concentration in EPS biofilm were not increased by coculture with L. acidophilus as probiotics. However, the treatment with 10% EEP could significantly increase nucleic acid concentration. CONCLUSION:  This study suggested that the biosurfactants from probiotic bacteria L. acidophilus might be a promising candidate for endodontic treatment, arguably better than EEP in inhibiting biofilm maturation and complexity."

      "abstract": "To test probiotic therapy for osteoarthritis (OA), we administered Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) by oral gavage (2×/week) after induction of OA by partial medial meniscectomy (PMM). Pain was assessed by von Frey filament and hot plate testing. Joint pathology and pain markers were comprehensively analyzed in knee joints, spinal cords, dorsal root ganglia and distal colon by Safranin O/fast green staining, immunofluorescence microscopy and RT-qPCR. LA acutely reduced inflammatory knee joint pain and prevented further OA progression. The therapeutic efficacy of LA was supported by a significant reduction of cartilage-degrading enzymes, pain markers and inflammatory factors in the tissues we examined. This finding suggests a likely clinical effect of LA on OA. The effect of LA treatment on the fecal microbiome was assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analysis. LA significantly altered the fecal microbiota compared to vehicle-treated mice (PERMANOVA p < 0.009). Our pre-clinical OA animal model revealed significant OA disease modifying effects of LA as reflected by rapid joint pain reduction, cartilage protection, and reversal of dysbiosis. Our findings suggest that LA treatment has beneficial systemic effects that can potentially be developed as a safe OA disease-modifying drug (OADMD)."

      "abstract": "Olsalazine is a typical 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) drug that depends on gut microbiota to liberate its anti-inflammatory moiety 5-ASA in the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). In recent decades, 5-ASA drugs combined with probiotics have achieved a better effective treatment for UC. Mechanisms of combination therapy have been widely discussed from a pharmacodynamic perspective. However, it is still unclear whether the better therapeutic efficacy of combination therapy was made by changing the metabolism of 5-ASA drugs in the colon under the regulation of probiotics. In the present study, combined with pharmacokinetic and gut microbiota analyses, we systematically evaluated the potential effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) on the metabolism of Olsalazine at three levels (pharmacokinetic characteristics, metabolic microbiota, and metabolic enzymes) to offer some insights into this issue. As pharmacokinetic results showed, L. acidophilus barely had an influence on the pharmacokinetic parameters of Olsalazine, 5-ASA, and N-Ac-5-ASA. Notably, the colonic exposure of 5-ASA was not affected by L. acidophilus. Gut microbiota results also illustrated that L. acidophilus did not change the total abundance of azoreductase (azoR) and N-acetyltransferase (NAT) associated gut microbiota and enzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of Olsalazine. Both pharmacokinetic and gut microbiota results revealed that L. acidophilus did not increase the colonic exposure of 5-ASA to improve the efficacy of combination therapy. L. acidophilus played its role in UC treatment by regulating gut microbiota composition and amino acid, phenolic acid, oligosaccharide, and peptidoglycan metabolic pathways. There was no potential medication risk of combination therapy of Olsalazine and L. acidophilus. In summary, this research provided strong evidence of medication safety and a comprehensive understanding of therapeutic advantages for combination therapy of probiotics and 5-ASA drugs from the pharmacokinetic and gut microbiota perspectives.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Caries lesions are high prevalent dental infectious. Gram-positive bacteria are the most common pathogenic microorganisms causing caries lesions. Low-Level laser therapy has been shown to have a significant bactericidal effect without causing damage to the oral tissues. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of diode laser (980 nm) at different times and doses on Streptococcus (S.) Mutans and (Lactobacillus) L. Acidophilus microorganisms. METHODS: This study was performed on two groups of microorganisms, including S. mutans and L. acidophilus, at a concentration of 108 CFU/ml, which exposed to a diode laser source with a central wavelength of 980 nm to investigate three different energies with the following time-exposures (at doses of 5, 10 and 20 J/cm2 with irradiation times of 5, 10 and 20 s). The growth of bacteria (CFU/ml) was calculated. RESULTS: A significant decrease in CFUs/ml of two microorganisms was observed immediately and 24 h after irradiation (p-value < 0.05). The most effective laser radiation for S. mutans immediately and 24 h after exposure was seen at 5 s with 20 J/cm2 and 20 s with 5 J/cm2, respectively. The most effective laser radiation for L. acidophilus was the time of 5 s with 10 J/cm2 both immediately and 24 h after exposure. CONCLUSION: In the present study, we demonstrated that diode laser (980 nm) has great efficacy in the growth reduction of S. mutans and L. acidophilus at different times and doses."

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic non-specific inflammatory bowel disease with complex pathogenesis. The intestinal flora disturbance affects the homeostasis of the intestinal environment, leading to metabolic imbalance and immune abnormalities of the host, contributing to the perpetuation of intestinal inflammation. We suggest that the combination of anti-inflammatory therapy and the regulation of intestinal flora balance may help in the treatment process. Previously, we used a combination treatment consisting of Lactobacillus acidophilus (Lac) and Chinese medicine Huan Kui Le (HKL) suspension in a UC rat model, where the combined intervention was more effective than either treatment alone. Herein, the mechanism of action of this combined treatment has been investigated using 16S rRNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA methods in the colon, and untargeted metabolomics profiling in serum. Colon protein expression levels of IL-13 and TGF-β were upregulated, whereas those of TLR9 and TLR4 were downregulated, consistent with an anti-inflammatory effect. In addition, gut microbiota structure changed, shown by a decrease in opportunistic pathogens correlated with intestinal inflammation, such as Klebsiella and Escherichia-Shigella, and an increase in beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium. The latter correlated positively with IL-13 and TGF-β and negatively with IFN-γ. Finally, this treatment alleviated the disruption of the metabolic profile observed in UC rats by increasing short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria in the colonic epithelium. This combination treatment also affected the metabolism of lactic acid, creatine, and glycine and inhibited the growth of Klebsiella. Overall, we suggest that treatment combining probiotics and traditional Chinese medicine is a novel strategy beneficial in UC that acts by modulating gut microbiota and its metabolites, TLR9, and cytokines in different pathways."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic cystitis is an inflammatory complication that can be caused by the administration of cyclophosphamide, which is widely used as an antineoplastic agent. In the search for new therapeutic alternatives, probiotics can suppress the inflammatory process and, therefore, can be used to prevent this disease. OBJECTIVE: Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of using Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM in the treatment of cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis in Wistar rats. METHODS: Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (2x108 CFU) was used in the treatment of cyclophosphamide- induced hemorrhagic cystitis (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) in 77 female Wistar rats. Rats were distributed into experimental groups (n = 9): control group (GC), zero control group (GCZ), inflammation group (GI), 24-hour acute treatment groups: 24-hour lactobacilli treatment group (GL24H) and mesna group (GM), and 30-day chronic treatment groups: lactobacilli treatment group (GTL) and mesna+lactobacilli group (GM+L). After treatment, animals were euthanized and biological materials were collected for blood count, biochemical analyses, examination of abnormal sediment elements (EAS), and histopathological analysis. RESULTS: GI results showed development of edema, macroscopic alterations, and signs of bleeding in the bladder; in addition, lesions in the urothelium and hemorrhage were also found. GL24H and GM presented intact urothelium, without inflammatory reaction and hematological or biochemical urine alterations. CONCLUSION: Therefore, this study demonstrated that L. acidophilus presented uroprotective effect against the action of cyclophosphamide in both the short and long term.",

      "abstract": "Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common clinical condition with symptoms and signs of vaginal inflammation in the presence of Candida species. At least one episode of VVC is experienced in up to 75% of women in the reproductive age group during their lifetime, and 5% to 8% of such women suffer from the chronic form. Most cases of VVC are still caused by C. albicans. However, the incidence of VVC cases by non-albicans Candida (NAC) species, such as C. parapsilosis, is continuously increasing. Despite the prevalence of VVC from NAC, little is known about these species and almost nothing about the mechanisms that trigger the VVC. Lactobacillus spp. are the most widely before represented microorganisms in the vaginal microbiota of healthy women. Here, cell-free supernatants (CFS) obtained from L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, and L. reuteri were assessed for their effect on C. parapsilosis virulence traits. Moreover, we assessed if such an effect persisted even after the removal of the CFS (CFS preincubation effect). Moreover, a transwell coculture system was employed by which the relevant antifungal effect was shown to be attributable to the compounds released by lactobacilli. Our results suggest that lactobacilli can work (i) by reducing C. parapsilosis virulence traits, as indicated by the reduced fungal proliferation, viability, and metabolic activity, and (ii) by improving epithelial resistance to the fungus. Overall, these data suggest that, in the context of the vaginal microbiota, the lactobacilli may play a role in preventing the onset of mucosal C. parapsilosis infection. IMPORTANCE The incidence of VVC by non-albicans Candida (NAC) species, such as C. parapsilosis, is increasing. Treatment failure is common in NAC-VVC because some species are resistant or poorly susceptible to the antifungal agents normally employed. Research on C. parapsilosis's pathogenic mechanisms and alternative treatments are still lacking. C. albicans triggers the VVC by producing hyphae, which favor the loss of epithelial tolerance. Differently, C. parapsilosis only produces pseudohyphae. Hence, different virulence factors may trigger the VVC. Likewise, the therapeutic options could also involve different fungal targets. Substantial in vitro and in vivo studies on the pathogenicity mechanisms of C. parapsilosis are lacking. The data presented here ascribe a novel beneficial role to different Lactobacillus spp., whose CFS provides a postbiotic-like activity against C. parapsilosis. Further studies are needed to unravel the mechanisms involved in the bioactivities of such compounds, to better understand the role of single postbiotics in the CFS.",

The grey literature was searched through Google Scholar. Authors of the original papers were contacted for additional data. The study included a total of 15 RCTs involving 1765 patients. Compared with placebo or no treatment, Lactobacillus acidophilus was associated with a reduced duration of diarrhea (moderate quality of evidence), but the effect was not statistically significant when only the individual probiotic strain was provided. Lactobacillus acidophilus was effective when used at a daily dose ≥ 109 CFU. There was no difference in the effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus on diarrhea duration among Asian, European, or American countries. Lactobacillus acidophilus reduced the frequency of diarrhea on day 2 to day 5. However, it was statistically significant on day 3. When administered at a dosage of more than 109 CFU to children with acute gastroenteritis, moderate- to low-quality data showed that Lactobacillus acidophilus reduced the duration of diarrhea and conferred a benefit for frequency of diarrhea.",

The cytotoxicity effect of lactic acid bacteria may be active by inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, producing anticancer compounds, and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells, but the mechanism is unclear. Our previous study revealed that Lactobacillus acidophilus KLDS1.0901 has good probiotic properties. In this study, We screened out the highest inhibition rate of L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 and assessed the effects on the proliferation of HT-29, Caco-2, and IEC-6 cells. Then, the apoptosis mechanism of HT-29 cells was studied when treated with L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901. Results showed that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 inhibited the proliferation of HT-29 and Caco-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner and reached the maximum under the condition of multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 100 (rate of Lactobacillus to cells) at 48 h. With the increase in time and MOI, reactive oxygen species in HT-29 cells, the apoptosis rates of HT-29 cells were increased, and the amount of blue fluorescence of the cells was also increased after Hoechst 33258 staining. Furthermore, L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential of HT-29 cells. Notably, 1,133 differentially expressed genes were screened by transcriptomics research, including 531 up-regulated genes and 602 down-regulated genes. These genes were involved in the nuclear factor κB and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways related to the apoptosis of HT-29 cells. These findings suggested that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 has the potential to be used in the development of a new type of functional foods for adjuvant treatment of colon cancer."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a critical complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The immunosuppressants given to patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT disturb the microbiome and the host immune system, potentially leading to dysbiosis and inflammation, and may affect immune function and bone marrow transplantation. The intestinal microbiome is a target for the development of novel therapies for GvHD. Lactobacillus species are widely used supplements to induce production of antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory factors. METHODS: We determined the effect of the combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus and FK506 on GvHD following major histocompatibility complex-mismatched bone marrow transplantation. RESULTS: The combination treatment suppressed IFN-γ and IL-17-producing T cell differentiation, but increased Foxp3+Treg differentiation and IL-10 production. Also, the combination treatment and combination treated-induced Treg cells modulated the proliferation of murine alloreactive T cells in vitro. Additionally, the combination treatment upregulated Treg-related genes-Nt5e, Foxp3, Ikzf2, Nrp1 and Itgb8-in murine CD4+-T cells. The combination treatment also alleviated GvHD clinically and histopathologically by controlling the effector T cell and Treg balance in vivo. Moreover, the combination treatment decreased Th17 differentiation significantly and significantly upregulated Foxp3 and IL-10 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy controls and liver transplantation (LT) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the combination of L. acidophilus and FK506 is effective and safe for patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",

The results indicated that the dietary supplementation with L. acidophilus and B. subtilis increased the integrity of the intestinal barrier as evidenced by the significant increase in the number of ileal goblet cells and improve the expression of occludin, claudin-1, and ZO-1 genes in the HD group. Moreover, the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ were significantly decreased in the LD and HD groups. The levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) increased in the LD and HD group, and the levels of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) increased with the HD treatment. Furthermore, 16 s rRNA sequencing revealed L. acidophilus in combination with B. subtilis increased the diversity of gut microbiota. The metabolomic analysis revealed beneficial changes in the amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism (decrease in LysoPC and LysoPE levels). In conclusion, dietary supplementation with L. acidophilus and B. subtilis could improve intestinal barrier function and maintain immune homeostasis.

Except for nitazoxanide (NTZ), there is no accredited cryptosporidiosis treatment to date. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find an effective and safe treatment for cryptosporidiosis. This study aimed to investigate the possible anti-protozoal effects of Syzygium aromaticum (clove) oil, Anethum graveolens (dill) seeds oil, Lactobacillus acidophilus LB, and zinc against Cryptosporidium parvum in comparison to NTZ. METHODS: Besides the negative control, mice from six experimental groups (T1-T6) were infected with Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. On the seventh day post-infection (PID), mice from five groups were treated for 8 consecutive days with NTZ, clove oil, dill seed oil, Lactobacillus acidophilus LB, and zinc commercial forms (T2-T5). Oocysts shedding rate, differences of mice body weight, serum IL10, and TNF-α, cryptosporidial antigen, and cd3 at the intestinal mucosa were evaluated at the end of the experiment. RESULTS: The mean of the C. parvum oocysts' shedding rate was significantly lower in all treated groups than in the non-treated group. The oocysts reduction rate was the highest in zinc-treated mice (98.3%), Lactobacillus acidophilus LB and dill-treated groups (95.77%), and the NTZ-treated group (91.55%). Clove oil was the least effective, with a 74.65% reduction rate. Excluding the clove oil-treated group, immunohistochemical analysis revealed the clearance of the Cryptosporidium antigen in the intestinal tissue in all treated groups. CONCLUSION: The study has provided a rational basis for using these safe, cheap, and commercially available alternatives in treating cryptosporidiosis combined with NTZ."

Three parameters including concentrations of sucrose [10 and 20% (w/w)] and yeast extract [1, 2 and 3% (w/w)] along with different amplitudes of ultrasound (30 kHz, 25 and 50%) were investigated in terms of their impacts on both viable cell counts and lactic acid production. Regarding RSM and GA, optimized samples were selected by achieving high lactic acid concentration. The results indicated that an increase in the amounts of sucrose and yeast extract led to increasing the cell growth and lactic acid production. Application of ultrasound at 25% amplitude significantly (P < 0.05) stimulated the fermentation process. However, increasing the amplitude to 50% significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the lactic acid production compared with the control samples. The best treatment was observed at 20% sucrose, 3% yeast extract and 25% ultrasound amplitude. The present results indicate that the best productivity of lactic acid can be achieved at appropriate fermentation conditions, including a suitable amplitude of ultrasound and supplementation of date syrup.",

AIMS: The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and/or prebiotic Mannan oligosaccharides on growth performance, blood biochemical variables, and faecal bacterial count in crossbred calves. METHODS: Fifteen-day-old crossbred calves (n=24) were divided into four groups, each consisting of six calves, and subjected to different experimental diets. The control group (T0) received a basal diet without any additives. The T1 and T2 groups received the basal diet and the probiotic (L. acidophilus, 2 × 1010 cfu/g) @ 1 g/calf per day and prebiotic (Mannan oligosaccharide) @ 4 g/calf per day, respectively. Calves of the T3 group were offered a basal diet and synbiotic (L. acidophilus, 0.5 g + Mannan oligosaccharide, 2 g/calf per day). The feed additives were mixed in milk. RESULTS: The results of 90 days feeding trial showed that calves of the T3 and T1 groups had higher (P<0.05) body weight (BW) gain and dry matter digestibility than the control. Feeding the probiotic showed a positive effect (P<0.05) on body length at the first, second, and third months, compared to the control. The blood serum total protein and globulin concentrations in the T1 group, on days 30 and 90, and T3 group, on day 90, were higher (P<0.05) than those of the control. All the treatment groups (T1, T2, and T3) showed a reduction (P<0.05) in faecal coliform and E. coli count, compared to the control, on the 15th and 30th days of the study. Additionally, the T2 group showed a significant coliform count reduction on days 45 and 60 of the study. CONCLUSION: The dietary addition of L. acidophilus, 2 × 1010 cfu/g @ 1 g/calf per day and the combination of L. acidophilus, 0.5 g + Mannan oligosaccharide, 2 g/calf per day improved growth performance, serum biochemical values, and favourable gut microbiota."

The study protocol was first approved by the facility's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Summit Ridge Farms; Susquehanna, PA) and followed throughout. Each of four test diets (control, NVL, MP, and MP + NVL [formulated to crude protein 25%, crude fat 14%, crude fiber 10% as-fed]) was fed once daily to maintain body weight for 21 d in a randomized-crossover design (four treatment periods and four washout periods). Fecal samples were collected on days 0 and 21 only for immunoglobulin A (IgA) and microbiota evaluation (16S rRNA V4 region and qPCR for Escherichia coli and Bifidobacterium), and fecal fermentative end-products and fecal pH were assessed only on day 21. Over the test periods, apparent total tract nutrient digestibility and stool quality were assessed. Data were analyzed by ANOVA (SAS v9.4, Cary, NC) or Kruskal-Wallis for between-diet effects, and paired t-test or Wilcoxon for time effects. Statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0.05. Apparent total tract nutrient digestibility revealed feeding MP-containing diets resulted in lower (P < 0.05) crude protein and fat digestibility vs. control and NVL diets. When dogs were fed MP, they had lower (P < 0.05) fecal pH compared with control and NVL diets, whereas fecal pH was lower in (P < 0.05) MP + NVL- vs. NVL-fed dogs. Fecal E. coli was (P < 0.05) lower at day 21 vs. day 0 when dogs were fed MP. Fecal Fusobacterium spp. was lower (P < 0.05) in both MP diets vs. control. Fecal Lactobacillus spp. increased (P < 0.05) from baseline with MP. Both diets with MP elicited greater (P < 0.05) fecal acetate and propionate concentration vs. control diet. At day 21, fecal IgA was greater (P < 0.05) in MP and MP + NVL compared with NVL diet. Only when dogs were fed MP did they have increased (P < 0.05) fecal IgA from day 21 vs. day 0. The MP + NVL diet decreased (P < 0.05) fecal isovalerate, isobutyrate, phenol, and indole vs. control. Overall, the MP elicited the most changes on microbiota, fermentative end-products, and IgA. Further investigation into NVL's gut health benefits is warranted.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Tacrolimus (Tac) is an immunosuppressant used in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); however, it induces T cell subset imbalances by reducing regulatory T (Treg) cells. Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) is reported to have therapeutic efficacy in immune-mediated diseases via T cell regulation. METHODS: This study investigated whether a combination therapy of LA and Tac improves the therapeutic efficacy of Tac by modulating T cell subset populations in an animal model of SLE. Eight-week-old MRL/lpr mice were orally administered with 5 mg/kg of Tac and/or 50 mg/kg of LA daily for 8 weeks. Cecal microbiota compositions, serum autoantibodies levels, the degree of proteinuria, histological changes in the kidney, and populations of various T cell subsets in the spleen were analyzed. RESULTS: Mice presented with significant gut dysbiosis, which were subsequently recovered by the combination treatment of Tac and LA. Double negative T cells in the peripheral blood and spleens of MRL/lpr mice were significantly decreased by the combination therapy. The combination treatment reduced serum levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies and Immunoglobulin G2a, and renal pathology scores were also markedly alleviated. The combination therapy induced Treg cells and decreased T helper 17 (Th17) cells both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro treatment with LA induced the production of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, programmed death-ligand 1, and interleukin-10 via the specific intracellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin homolog-related 3 receptor signals. CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate that LA augments the therapeutic effect of Tac and modulates Th17/Treg balance in a murine model of SLE.",

      "abstract": "Obesity associated with low-grade chronic inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis is considered as a worldwide public health crisis. In the meanwhile, different probiotics have demonstrated beneficial effects on this condition, thus increasing the interest in the development of probiotic treatments. In this context, the aim of this study is to investigate the anti-obesity effects of potential probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus isolated from the porcine gut. Then, it is found that L. acidophilus reduces body weight, fat mass, inflammation and insulin resistance in mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD), accompanied by activation in brown adipose tissue (BAT) as well as improvements of energy, glucose and lipid metabolism. Besides, our data indicate that L. acidophilus not only reverses HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, as indicated by the decreased Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratios and endotoxin bearing Gram-negative bacteria levels, but also maintains intestinal barrier integrity, reduces metabolic endotoxemia, and inhibits the TLR4 / NF- κB signaling pathway. In addition, the results of microbiome phenotype prediction by BugBase and bacterial functional potential prediction using PICRUSt show that L. acidophilus treatment improves the gut microbiota functions involving metabolism, immune response, and pathopoiesia. Furthermore, the anti-obesity effect is transmissible via horizontal faeces transfer from L. acidophilus-treated mice to HFD-fed mice. According to our data, it is seen that L. acidophilus could be a good candidate for probiotic of ameliorating obesity and associated diseases such as hyperlipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases, and insulin resistance through its anti-inflammatory properties and alleviation of endothelial dysfunction and gut dysbiosis.",

However, whether probiotics are effective in reducing the bacterial load of H. pylori and modifying the gut microbiota remains unknown. We aimed to assess the efficacy of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus in reducing the bacterial load of H. pylori and modifying the gut microbiota. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited 40 adult subjects with moderate to high bacterial loads of H. pylori, defined as a mean delta over baseline (DOB) value of the 13 C-urea breath test (13 C-UBT) of 10 or greater every 4 days 6 times. Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either probiotics containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus or placebo twice daily for 4 weeks. 13 C-UBT was measured weekly from the beginning of treatment to 2 weeks after treatment. Amplification of the V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA was performed for fecal microbiota. RESULTS: A total of 40 subjects were randomized to receive probiotics or placebo. The DOB value was significantly lower in the probiotic group than in the placebo group after 4 weeks of treatment (26.0 vs. 18.5, p = .045). The DOB value was significantly reduced compared to that at baseline in the probiotic group (18.5 vs. 26.7, p = .001) but not in the placebo group (26.0 vs. 25.0, p = .648). However, the eradication rate for H. pylori was 0% in both groups. There was no significant difference in the DOB values between the two groups 1 and 2 weeks after discontinuation of the probiotics. There were also no significant changes observed in the α-diversity and β-diversity at week 4 compared to baseline in the probiotic group (p = .77 and 0.91) and the placebo group (p = .26 and 0.67). CONCLUSIONS: Although the use of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus may reduce the bacterial load of H. pylori, there were no significant changes in the composition of gut microbiota.

It is well known that immunotherapy could suppress tumor formation by modulating the immune system of the host. The aim of the study is to investigate supportive therapy potential of acidophilus milk (AS) and propolis extract (PE) in the mouse xenograft breast cancer model. For this purpose, firstly cytotoxic effect of PE was determined by MTT assay against 4 T1 mouse breast cancer cells. Apoptotic effect of PE analyzed by flow cytometry. The antibacterial activity of PE was determined by the 96-well microplate broth-dilution method on Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5. Then, Balb/c mice were injected subcutaneously with 4 T1 cells (2x105 cells/mouse) and also mice were given daily oral gavage with PE (66 mg/kg/day) and/or acidophilus milk (108 CFU/mL/mouse/day) for 14 days. The Balb/c mice were weighed throughout the study, and the tumor sizes were measured by caliper at the 14th day. The proliferation of splenocytes which collected spleen from mice was measured by MTT. CD8 + T cell response was analyzed by flow cytometry and results were evaluated in comparison with control and tumor control groups. The IC50 value for PE on 4 T1 cells was determined as 129.25 ± 1.90 µg/mL. The apoptotic effect of PE at IC50 concentration was determined as 3.3% of cells to late-apoptosis, 4.3% of cells to pro-apoptosis and 2.5% of cells to necrosis. The MIC and MBC values for PE on L. acidophilus LA-5 were 5000 ppm. The treatment of PE, AS and the combination of PE and AS were inhibited the tumor volumes by 59.16%, 28.29% and 63.39%, respectively. Acidophilus milk and PE combination significantly enhanced the ConA-, LPS- and PHA-induced splenocyte proliferation (P < 0.05). The acidophilus milk and PE combination were also found to stimulate IFN- γ production. In conclusion, the best anti-tumor effect was obtained by the combination of acidophilus milk and propolis.",

The aim of this study was to show that the combination of C. cochlearium and L. acidophilus (CC-LA) has beneficial effects on body weight control and glucose homeostasis in high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. METHODS: In this study, thirty-six 6-wk-old male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to three groups of 12 mice each. The experimental group (CC-LA) was administered with CC-LA mixture and fed ad libitum with a high-fat diet. High-fat diet (HF) control and low-fat diet (LF) control groups were treated with the same dose of sterile water as the CC-LA group. RESULTS: After 17 wk of dietary intervention, the CC-LA group showed 17% less body weight gain than the HF group did (P < 0.01). The CC-LA group also showed significantly reduced incremental area under the curve of oral glucose tolerance test and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance compared with the HF group. The results from 16S rRNA sequencing analysis of gut microbiota showed that the CC-LA administration led to overall increased α-diversity indices, and a significant microbial separation from the HF group. The ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) was reduced from 3.30 in the HF group to 1.94 in the CC-LA group. The relative abundances of certain obesity-related taxa were also decreased by CC-LA administration. CONCLUSION: The present study provided evidence that the CC-LA combination reduced obesity and improved glucose metabolism in high-fat diet-treated DIO mice, potentially mediated by the modulation of gut microbiota.",
