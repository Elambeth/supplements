      "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the possible protective effects of chitosan (CS) on fluoride-induced nephrotoxicity. 28 rats were divided into four groups (n = 7). The Control group received drinking water. Sodium fluoride (NaF) group received 100 mg/L NaF in drinking water. NaF + CS group received 100 mg/L NaF and 250 mg/kg/day CS by gastric gavage. CS group was given 250 mg/kg/day CS by gavage. The study period lasted 12 weeks. Total kidney volume, Bowman's capsule volume, Bowman's space volume, Tubular volume and Glomerulus volume were measured by stereological methods. Immunohistochemically, caspase-3 and TNF-alpha expressions were evaluated. Biochemically, levels of urea and creatinine were measured. In addition, a histopathological evaluation of the kidney was performed. According to the control group, an increase was observed in all stereological parameters except glomerulus volume in the NaF group. CS treatment inhibited the increase in stereological parameters. Fluoride increased expressions of caspase-3 and TNF-α in the kidney, and serum urea and creatine levels, but CS decreased these parameters. In addition, pathological changes in the kidney caused by fluoride such as tubular dilatation, enlargement of the Bowman's space, and deterioration in tubular epithelial cells were restored with CS treatment. The conclusions of the current study reveal that fluoride can cause nephrotoxicity and CS treatment can prevent fluoride-induced nephrotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Dental injury is a significant issue in children due to their immature physical, cognitive, and physiological development. These factors often result in heightened fear and behavioral challenges during their first visit following trauma, which can compromise the quality of treatment and lead to a poor prognosis for the affected tooth. Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF), a colorless solution approved by the US FDA for treating dental hypersensitivity and caries, offers a simple, painless, and non-invasive treatment option. Its application involves a paint-on technique with a powerful fluoride formulation, making it an ideal choice for the initial management of enamel and dentin fractures in primary teeth, particularly in uncooperative young children. CASE DESCRIPTION: This case series described four cases in which SDF was successfully used as the primary treatment for Ellis Class IX anterior tooth trauma in very young children with negative behavior responses in the dental setting. The procedure required minimal armamentarium and was well-tolerated by all patients. CONCLUSION: In each case, the use of SDF yielded successful and satisfactory outcomes, with a favorable prognosis for the affected teeth. Additionally, the treatment contributed to a positive shift in the children's attitudes toward dental care."

      "abstract": "In this study, a pre-designed cation exchange resin (CER) column was first tested to remove calcium in naturally contaminated water from acid sulfate soil for water supply purpose, and it was further used as a novel and natural calcium hydroxide-supported CER composite (NCHO/CER) for the treatment of fluoride in water. Results of SEM, EDX, FTIR, and XRD analyses confirmed the formation of calcium hydroxide nanoparticles in the CER structure. The fluoride adsorption capacity of NCHO/CER was systematically studied by varying the influencing factors, such as the reaction time, pH level, adsorbent mass, initial concentration, and temperature. The adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo-second-order model, while the isotherm curves fitted to the Freundlich model, indicating the occurrence of multilayer adsorption on the adsorbent surface. Moreover, NCHO/CER showed the ability not only to be reused after multiple cycles but also to remove fluoride from actual tap water and groundwater, proving that NCHO/CER is effective for the recovery and reuse of contaminated calcium for fluoride treatment in water."

      "abstract": "The sustainable management of industrial byproducts represents a critical challenge for the aluminum industry. This study developed a cost-effective adsorbent (SA@RM) derived from sodium alginate and red mud for fluoride removal, addressing both solid waste utilization and water purification needs. Systematic adsorption experiments revealed optimal performance under conditions of 15 g/L dosage and pH 5, achieving adsorption equilibrium within 40 min for initial fluoride concentrations of 11.7 mg/L. Notably, the adsorbent demonstrated exceptional cyclic stability, maintaining 54.8% adsorption capacity through three regeneration cycles. The adsorption process followed the Langmuir isotherm model (R2 = 0.994) and pseudo-second-order kinetics (R2 = 0.975), indicating monolayer chemisorption as the dominant mechanism. Advanced characterization techniques (SEM-EDS, FT-IR, XPS) elucidated three main mechanisms: fluoride complexation with aluminum oxides, ligand exchange with surface hydroxyl groups, and ion exchange with chloride species. This material achieves 92% fluoride removal while valorizing industrial waste, reducing adsorbent production costs by 60-70% compared to conventional materials. The detailed mechanism analysis provides fundamental insights for designing waste-derived adsorbents, offering a practical solution for sustainable industrial development and water treatment applications."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effect of Artemisia absinthium extract on testicular dysfunction in rats and explain the involvement of the androgen receptor signaling pathway as a biomarker in maintaining fertility during sodium fluoride (NaF) treatment. Thirty-two male rats were divided equally into four groups and received treatment for 60 days. The control group (I) received normal saline; group II received Artemisia extract at 100 mg/kg b.w.; group III received NaF at 12 mg/kg b.w. orally; and group IV received NaF (12 mg/kg b.w.) and Artemisia extract (100 mg/kg b.w.). The testis weights and the lipid peroxidation, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone levels were estimated. The genital organs were prepared and immunoreacted with a receptor. Histomorphometric analyses were performed to obtain the diameter of the seminiferous tubules and the height of the germinal epithelia in the testes. The results showed that exposure to NaF caused a significant increase in testis weight and malondialdehyde (MDA) and a decrease in serum LH, FSH, and testosterone concentrations compared to the control group, while extract administration induced an increase in the levels of these hormones in group IV. Testicular histological and histomorphometric changes were observed in group III: degenerative seminiferous tubules with vascular congestion, disorganization of the germinal layer, and decreased seminiferous tubule diameter and germinal epithelium height. The expression of androgen receptors in the testes of the NaF-treated rats was significantly reduced. In contrast, these testicular histological changes were ameliorated in rats treated with the extract. The results allow us to conclude that the administration of Artemisia absinthium confers positive effects on male reproductive function by inhibiting fluoride, maybe via ameliorative testicular function."

      "abstract": "Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes have become a favored choice for membrane filtration because of their outstanding mechanical characteristics, chemical resistance, thermal stability, and ease of handling. Nevertheless, the hydrophobic nature of PVDF membranes can result in fouling, which diminishes their efficiency over time. This study explores the impact of ZnO-Nanoclay on the properties and performance of mixed matrix membranes made from polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) at different loading percentages (0, 1, and 3 wt%). The ZnO-Nanoclay nanoparticles were synthesized using environmentally friendly methods, characterized, and blended into PVDF matrices via a solution-casting technique, resulting in a series of membranes. The synthesized nanoparticles were analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The resulting mixed-matrix membranes underwent comprehensive analyses to assess their structure and surface properties, employing SEM, XRD, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and contact-angle measurements. Furthermore, tensile, antibacterial, and barrier properties were evaluated. Integrating ZnO-Nanoclay into PVDF membranes greatly improves antifouling properties, achieving inhibition rates of 99.92% at a clay-loading percentage of 3 wt% and increasing water-flux rates by 16% compared to pure PVDF membranes at 1 wt%. In addition, ZnO-Nanoclay nanoparticles significantly boost the mechanical properties of PVDF membranes, enhancing maximum strength by 500% at 3 wt% loading. This study examines the interplay between the structure, properties, and performance of mixed-matrix membranes by comparing different PVDF membranes that were mixed with different nanoclay composites, providing significant insights into improving these membranes through the incorporation of nanoclay composites to enhance their overall properties and effectiveness."

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was an assessment of the anti-biofilm properties of fluoride non-thermal atmospheric plasma (FNTAP) generated using argon and hydrocarbon fluoride gas 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (TFE). These properties were evaluated by measuring the destruction and recovery of in vitro dual-species biofilms of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis exposed to FNTAP at 5 or 10 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) or argon non-thermal atmospheric plasma (ArNTAP) for 1 or 2 min, using resazurin-based reagent viability assays, colony forming units (CFU), culture media pH and live/dead staining. Both ArNTAP and FNTAP resulted in significant immediate reductions in bacterial load as compared to the control. Although ArNTAP did not significantly reduce biofilm regrowth, FNTAP treatment showed a bacterial load reduction of more than 5 log units of biofilm regrowth. FNTAP treatments significantly reduced the acidification of the culture medium after recovery incubation, indicating reduced living bacteria, with a pH of 6.92 ± 0.02 and 6.90 ± 0.03, respectively, for the 5 sccm and 10 sccm FNTAP treatments, as compared to a pH of 5.83 ± 0.26 for the ArNTAP treatment, and a significantly acidic pH of 4.76 ± 0.04 for the no-treatment groups. Our results suggest that FNTAP has exceptional anti-biofilm effects, and future directions of our research include the assessment of potential applications of FNTAP in clinical settings."

      "abstract": "This study examines the effects of natural organic matter (NOM) and dissolved solids on fluoride (F-) retention in polyelectrolyte multilayer-based hollow-fiber nanofiltration membranes (dNF40). Lab-scale filtration experiments were conducted under varying operating conditions (initial salt concentration, NOM concentration, permeate flux, crossflow velocity, and recovery rate). dNF40 membranes exhibited F- retention above 70% ± 1.2 in the absence of NOM and competing ions. However, when filtering synthetic model water (SMW) designed to simulate groundwater contaminated with high total dissolved solids (TDSs) and NOM, F- retention decreased to approximately 60% ± 0.7, which was generally attributed to ion competition. Furthermore, despite limited declines in normalized permeability, the addition of NOM to SMW notably deceased F- retention in the steady state to~20% due to fouling effects. The facilitated transport of the divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+ could be observed, as they accumulated in the organic fouling layer. While SO42- retention remained relatively stable, the retention of monovalent anions (NO3-, Cl-, and F-) decreased substantially due to drag effects. Na+ retention improved slightly to maintain electroneutrality. Feed salinity was shown to significantly affect separation efficiency, with PEC layers undergoing swelling and certain structural changes as the ionic strength increased. During batch filtration experiments at varying recovery rates, the retention of monovalent anions further decreased, with F- retention reducing to just ~10% at a 90% recovery rate. This study provides valuable insights into better understanding and optimizing the performance of PEC-based NF membranes across diverse water treatment scenarios."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Children from marginalized backgrounds show higher susceptibility to early childhood caries which can have serious repercussions. Determining the ideal application frequency of 38% silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is crucial for those with limited access to dental care. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of different frequencies of 38% SDF application in halting the progression of active dentin coronal carious lesions in primary teeth of children aged 2-6 years. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial with parallel arms was conducted at Amrita Kripa Hospital, Kalpetta, Wayanad, a region with a significant tribal population. Children with cavitated carious lesions were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) annual group (one application per year), (2) biannual group (two applications per year), and (3) four applications per year (at baseline, 2, 4, and 8 weeks). Carrie's arrest was assessed at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: The study included 80 children and 440 teeth. The four-application group showed the highest caries arrest rate (80.5%), followed by the biannual group (78.2%) and the annual group (58.4%). Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between the groups (χ2 = 21.873, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: More frequent SDF applications (four times per year) were significantly more effective in halting caries progression compared to biannual or annual applications, particularly evident in tribal children; a high-risk population with limited access to dental care. The study supports the use of SDF as a noninvasive, cost-effective preventive treatment for young children, especially in resource-limited settings, and emphasizes the need for frequent SDF applications in community-based oral health programs with limited dental care access."

      "abstract": "The antimicrobial properties of dressings are critical for wound recovery, as they serve as the first line of defense against microbial invasion. In this study, bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) was synthesized and immobilized onto a piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fiber membrane to achieve enhanced photocatalytic sterilization efficacy. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy analyses unambiguously verified that Bi2S3 formed a nanosheet structure on the PVDF surface. The specific surface area of the PVDF/Bi2S3 composite was measured to be 175.3 m2·g-1, indicating a high surface area for potential antimicrobial activity. The PVDF/Bi2S3 composite demonstrated strong light absorption in both the visible and near-infrared regions, generating significant amounts of reactive oxygen species under simulated sunlight. Photocatalytic sterilization experiments revealed that PVDF/Bi2S3 exhibited superior antibacterial performance against both Escherichia coli and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus compared to PVDF or Bi2S3 powder alone. These findings demonstrate that the inherent polarization field within the PVDF matrix significantly enhances the photocatalytic efficiency of Bi2S3. Furthermore, under vibration conditions, the piezotronic effect of the PVDF membrane further improved the photocatalytic sterilization efficiency of PVDF/Bi2S3 compared to static conditions. When applied as a dressing for trauma treatment in mice, the movement and limb traction of the animals activated the piezotronic effect of the PVDF fiber membrane. This dynamic interaction enhanced the photocatalytic bactericidal properties of the dressing, thus promoting wound healing and optimizing the overall efficacy of PVDF/Bi2S3 in wound treatment."

We aimed to describe features associated with a dysfunctional bone metabolism determined by 18F-Sodium Fluoride Positron Emission Tomography (18F-NaF PET) in patients with DM and test the effects of vitamin K1 and colchicine therapy on vertebral 18F-NaF activity. METHODS: This is a post-hoc analysis of a 2 × 2 factorial randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Participants aged 50-80 with DM underwent 18F-NaF PET/CT imaging at baseline, 3 months of therapy with vitamin K1 (10mg/daily) or placebo, and colchicine (0.5 mg/day) or placebo and repeat 18F-NaF PET/CT. The 18F-NaF vertebral mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) and the CT estimated bone mineral density (BMD) (in Hounsfield units) was evaluated from thoracic vertebra. RESULTS: In total, 149 individuals (66.4 % male, mean age 65.5 ± 6.8 years) were included. Male sex (β -1.421, 95 % CI [-1.826, -1.016], p < 0.001), duration of DM in years (-0.021 [-0.039, -0.002], p = 0.030) and CT estimated vertebral BMD (0.011 [0.006, 0.015], p < 0.001) were independently associated with the SUVmean. The change in the SUVmean was similar between vitamin K1 or placebo groups (-0.07 ± 0.64 v 0.07 ± 0.69, p = 0.20). Participants receiving colchicine therapy had a greater reduction in the SUVmean, compared with placebo (-0.12 ± 0.72 v 0.11 ± 0.60, p = 0.039). CONCLUSION: 18F-NaF PET may be a useful measure of vertebral bone metabolism in people with DM. Three months of oral colchicine reduced the 18F-NaF vertebral SUVmean, whereas Vitamin K1 had no effect. The findings should be considered hypothesis generating.

Evidence from large pragmatic trials support the use of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) to prevent and control caries in school dental programs. In this pilot, we developed implementation strategies and integrated SDF into an existing school-based dental program, Smiles For Students (SFS). METHODS: This was a single-group observational pilot. Using a school-based SDF implementation toolkit, SFS clinicians received training in clinical protocols as well as ongoing interactive technical assistance to support SDF integration. SDF was then implemented into existing clinical workflows. RESULTS: Following training and implementation, the Smiles For Students program saw a 23 % increase in the number of patients served, a 53 % decrease in the per-child treatment time, a 45 % decrease in labor costs despite increased enrollment, and a 24 % decrease in supply costs. Qualitative feedback indicated strong support for simplified clinical protocols, reduction in cumbersome supplies and materials, and increased flexibility with space and resources. CONCLUSIONS: In a pilot implementation project in which SDF was integrated into an existing school-based dental program serving 16 schools, multiple logistical and economic challenges were mitigated and program clinicians utilized both sealants and SDF to meet the needs of participating children."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty sound dentin specimens were prepared from 60 extracted intact third molars, then treated with 17 % EDTA for 60 s to simulate hypersensitive dentin, and randomly divided into 2 series. Series 1 (dentin permeability test; n = 40) had 4 different treatment groups: (1) universal adhesive (self-etch mode), (2) universal adhesive (total-etch mode), (3) SnF2 pretreatment + universal adhesive (self-etch), (4) SnF2 pretreatment + universal adhesive (total-etch). The IDS of each group was the percentage decrease of hydraulic conductance of dentin after bonding. Series 2 (n = 20) was SEM-EDS analysis of different treated dentin before bonding. The data were analyzed using 2-way ANOVA and Tukey test. RESULTS: In groups of no SnF2 pretreatment, the IDS of universal adhesive were 79.53 ± 20.71 and 77.34 ± 18.14 % for self-etch and total-etch mode, respectively. In groups of SnF2 pretreatment, the corresponding values were 71.54 ± 15.56 and 69.56 ± 9.92 %, respectively. Although SnF2 pretreated-dentin had the remarkable signals of silicon and tin, there were no significant reductions in the IDS of universal adhesive (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: SnF2 desensitizing toothpaste has no adverse effect on the immediate dentin sealing ability of universal adhesive."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Although preventable, dental caries remains highly prevalent. Many children do not receive preventive dental services routinely in clinical settings. This review examined the effectiveness of school (preschool through high school) fluoride varnish delivery programs (SFVDP) in preventing caries. METHODS: Community Guide systematic review methods were followed. In 2024, databases were searched for studies published through December 2023 on SFVDP effectiveness in increasing fluoride varnish (FV) receipt and decreasing caries. Included studies had to be written in English, published in peer-reviewed journals, and conducted in upper-middle or high-income countries. Data synthesis conducted in 2024 used median RR and interquartile interval (IQI) to summarize findings across studies. RESULTS: Of 31 included studies with 60,780 students, 25 were randomized controlled trials-20 with good quality of execution. Most studies were conducted in low socioeconomic status (SES) areas among students at elevated caries risk. SFVDP reduced caries initiation by 32% (IQI: 21%, 37%) in permanent teeth (19 studies, 25,826 students) and by 25% (IQI: 4%, 37%) in primary teeth (12 studies, 4,304 students). Stratified assessments indicated findings were largely applicable to different settings, populations, and intervention characteristics. Two studies found SFVDP significantly increased the number of annual FV applications and two found that SFVDP effectiveness was inversely related to SES. DISCUSSION: About 30% of states report having no SFVDPs. Possible barriers to implementation include that Medicaid in some states only reimburses dental and medical professionals and does not reimburse non-dental providers for FV delivered to children older than 6 years."

      "abstract": "Health authorities have promoted community water fluoridation (CWF) to prevent dental caries for more than 75 years. However, growing evidence has raised questions about the safety of this public health intervention, particularly for young children who are at risk of excess fluoride intake. Divergent opinions about the risk-benefit ratio of CWF have ignited a global debate. The efficacy of topical fluoride in preventing dental caries is strong, whereas contemporary evidence for systemic administration of fluoride is weaker. Inequalities in access to dental care and topical fluorides introduce an additional layer of complexity. This review discusses evidence showing that fluoride ingestion is not essential for caries prevention, offers little benefit to the fetus and young infant, and can cause dental fluorosis and cognitive deficits. In an environment where fluoride is available from multiple sources, community-based administration of systemic fluoride may pose an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio for pregnant women and young children.",

      "abstract": "Understanding and controlling the surface properties of bioscaffolds are crucial for regulating cell adhesion and proliferation behaviors. We here focused on poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), in which polymer chains are oriented through poling treatment to form a polar β-form crystal. The surface aggregation states of uniaxially stretched PVDF films subjected to poling treatment were investigated based on water contact angle measurements and sum-frequency generation spectroscopy. During poling treatment under a sufficiently strong electric field, the dipole moments of β-form crystals, which are inherently aligned within each crystalline domain, become more uniformly oriented across the entire film. As a result, the surface resists structural reorganization even upon exposure to water. This stable surface, which maintains its aggregation states despite environmental changes, was found to promote cell adhesion and proliferation, as well as protein adsorption. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationship between the aggregation states on polymer scaffold surfaces and protein interactions, ultimately advancing insights into cell behaviors."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two maxillary quadrants from 32 patients were randomly allocated to intervention and control groups in a split-mouth design. In control group, bleaching gel containing 40% hydrogen peroxide and in intervention group, the same gel with 2% NaF were applied for 45 min. Before treatment, immediately, 24 h, 7d, 30d and 90d after treatment, sensitivity to cold, touch and spontaneous stimuli was measured through Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Color changes were evaluated by a spectrophotometer and reported through ΔE and ΔSGU values. Data were analyzed by Shapiro-Wilk, 2Q AZMann-Whiteny U, Friedman and Wilcoxon tests (α = 0.05). RESULTS: A total of 29 patients completed the study. The cold and spontaneous sensitivity significantly decreased from baseline until 90d post-bleaching in both groups (P < 0.001), while a significant decline in tactile sensitivity demonstrated only in NaF group (p = 0.01). In the comparison between two groups, only the cold sensitivity was significantly lower in NaF group at 90d after bleaching (p = 0.040). There was no significant difference between two groups in ΔE/ΔSGU values at any of evaluation intervals. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of 2% NaF into the bleaching gel significantly reduced cold sensitivity after 90d, with no detrimental effects on whitening effectiveness. (IRCT20200906048639N1) CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The in-office bleaching gel containing 2% NaF did not demonstrate a beneficial impact on BS. Nonetheless, it did not negatively affect the results of tooth whitening.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Untreated dental caries remains a significant public health issue, particularly among children and adolescents from low-income families, where disparities persist. The COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) changed dental care practices, leading to an increased focus on minimally aerosolizing treatments such as silver diamine fluoride (SDF). This study aimed to describe the temporal changes in SDF utilization among Medicaid-enrolled children across the United States before and during the first half of the COVID-19 PHE. Additionally, the study examined the impact of demographics and state-level policies on SDF utilization. METHODS: We conducted a multiyear cross-sectional study using enrollment and claims data from the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS) for 2019, 2020, and 2021. The study population included Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) beneficiaries aged <21 years. We analyzed SDF utilization rates and compared them with other dental services, stratifying the data by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and rurality. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to identify significant predictors of SDF utilization. RESULTS: The study included approximately 39 million children each year. SDF utilization per 1,000 enrollees increased from 9.10 in 2019 to 16.81 in 2021, with the most significant increases observed in children aged 0-6 years, those living in rural areas, and American Indian/Alaskan Native children. The state-level reimbursement policy for SDF was the most significant predictor, with children in states with such policies being 10.5 times more likely to receive SDF treatment. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 PHE significantly impacted SDF utilization among Medicaid-enrolled children, highlighting the importance of state-level policies. The findings can be used to develop targeted approaches for clinicians to improve access to SDF treatment to address oral health disparities.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Artificial caries lesions were induced on human dentin discs using a bacterial model and divided into four groups: C (no treatment), CT (no treatment, thermocycling), CS (SDF), and CST (SDF, thermocycling). The treated-dentin surface was bonded with universal adhesive (etch-and-rinse mode) and stored for 24 h or subjected to 10,000 thermocycles. µTBS was performed with 1 mm/min crosshead speed with a 50 N load cell (n = 16/group). The resin-dentin interface was examined using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (n = 3/group). Statistical analyses included two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc tests for µTBS and Fisher's Exact Test with Bonferroni correction for failure mode distribution. RESULTS: The highest bond strength was observed in C (24.28 ± 2.27 MPa) followed by CST (18.26 ± 5.63 MPa). Significantly lower µTBS was detected in CS (14.20 ± 3.32 MPa) and CT (12.72 ± 2.12 MPa). CT exhibited a distinct failure mode from the other groups (p < 0.05). CLSM revealed less uniform resin tags in CS and CST. EDX demonstrated silver deposition at 50 μm beneath the adhesive layer in CS and at 120 μm with lower intensity in CST. CONCLUSIONS: SDF enhances bonding durability, as evidenced by increased µTBS and modified resin-dentin interface. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: SDF may enhance the durability of bonding with universal adhesive in etch-and-rinse mode.",

METHOD AND MATERIALS: In total, 22 children with 53 hypersensitive MIH-affected permanent molars (MIH TNI 3 or 4) underwent AgF+KI application after isolation with cotton rolls. Teeth included had no prior in-office desensitizing agents or sealants within 1 month before recruitment. Hypersensitivity was assessed using a 1-second air blast stimulus at three intervals: baseline, 15 minutes, and 3 months posttreatment (blinded). The response to the air-stimulus was quantified using the Schiff Cold Air Sensitivity Scale (SCASS), and teeth with grades 2 and 3 only were included. Statistical analysis involved the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Friedman test. RESULTS: The reported mean SCASS scores declined significantly from 2.5 (± 0.5) at baseline to 1.2 (± 0.9) after 15 minutes and 1.0 (± 1.0) after 3 months (n = 20 patients, n = 49 molars). Molars with SCASS 2 had a statistically significantly lower mean hypersensitivity score (from n = 26 to n = 24) compared to SCASS 3 teeth (from n = 27 to n = 19) at the subsequent posttreatment evaluation. However, the percentage reduction from baseline was not significant. Additionally, the reduction in hypersensitivity after AgF+KI application was almost identical for treated (desensitizing agent >1 month prior enrolment) and untreated molars. CONCLUSION: AgF+KI is an effective and simple desensitizer providing instant and mid-term relief in schoolchildren with hypersensitive MIH-molars.",

A novel adsorbent was synthesized herein by wrapping glucose/graphene oxide hybrids with aluminum hydroxide in a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide microemulsion and was used for dual adsorption of fluoride (FL) and methylene blue (MB) from water. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda analysis were employed to characterize the synthesized adsorbent. The pH, initial pollutant concentration, adsorbent dose, and contact time for dual adsorption were determined. Isotherm and kinetic models were applied to investigate the dual adsorption mechanism. Attributed to the good microstructure, enhanced surface area, and ion-exchange behavior, the maximum adsorption capacity of this adsorbent was 14.8 mg/g for FL (1.0 g/L adsorbent) and 232.6 mg/g for MB (0.2 g/L adsorbent) simultaneously at pH 6.0. The enhanced adsorption efficiency and multi- selectivity of this adsorbent suggest its potential to decrease the regeneration frequency of adsorption materials, lower processing costs, and mitigate environmental impacts. This adsorbent is suitable for future development as a sustainable slow-release agent, enabling prolonged use with straightforward operational procedures and efficiency."

It compares two modified alginate-based adsorbents: zirconium-crosslinked alginate (AZ) and a newly developed material created by combining ferric aluminosilicate laterite (FASL), a mining by-product, with alginate and crosslinking it with zirconium, called ALZ. Both AZ and ALZ were synthesized and characterized using SEM-EDX, FT-IR, TGA-DTA, XRD, XRF, and BET. Their ability to remove fluoride from aqueous solutions was tested, achieving over 70 % removal efficiency through process optimization with response surface methodology (RSM). The adsorption process followed the Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetics. Increasing temperature improved fluoride adsorption for both materials, with maximum capacities at 30 °C and 50 °C: 70.27 mg g-1 and 117.64 mg g-1 for AZ, and 170.14 mg g-1 and 410.81 mg g-1 for ALZ, respectively. Thermodynamic analysis confirmed the process was spontaneous across all temperatures. Mathematical modelling was also used to predict fluoride breakthrough. This research provides valuable insights for developing efficient methods to address fluoride contamination, with both industrial and drinking water samples tested. The synthesis process demonstrated environmental sustainability, with a low environmental-factor (E-factor) of 0.023, highlighting its eco-friendly nature."

This study aims to investigate the effects of sodium fluoride on myopia and to offer novel theoretical foundations for future strategies in myopia prevention and control. The experimental data showed that sodium fluoride could promote myopia progression, and through bioinformatics analysis, we found that sodium fluoride could affect the ferroptosis pathway. Western blotting and redox kit assays further confirmed that sodium fluoride activates the ferroptosis pathway. We also demonstrated that PIEZO1 plays a crucial role in sodium fluoride-induced myopia, and that the PIEZO1 inhibitor (GsMTx4) can inhibit the ferroptosis pathway. Subsequently, we identified PIEZO1 as a potential target of baicalin, which inhibited PIEZO1 expression in vivo and in vitro, as confirmed by molecular docking modeling and CETSA assays. Finally, we found that baicalin inhibited sodium fluoride-induced myopia via PIEZO1. Taken together, our findings indicate that sodium fluoride can promote myopia progression by activating the ferroptosis pathway through PIEZO1, and that targeting PIEZO1 expression can delay myopia progression, which may provide a new drug target for myopia treatment in the future.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) on microhardness and microleakage of composite and glass ionomer cement restorations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cavities were prepared in 28 extracted teeth and restored according to four regimens (GIC, composite, GIC and SDF conditioned, composite and SDF conditioned). The restored teeth were thermocycled and autoclaved and then exposed to cariogenic challenge (inoculated with Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus mutans) for 30 days. The restored teeth were sectioned mesio-distally. One half was subjected to microleakage testing (dye penetration using 2% methylene blue) and the other to Vickers hardness test. RESULTS: Group 4 SDF + Composite had the highest mean microleakage at 1.59 ± 0.02 (mm), and Group 1 (GIC) and Group 3 (Composite) had the lowest mean microleakage (0.63 ± 0.009 mm and 0.63 ± 0.02 mm, respectively). The highest mean microhardness (HV) was observed in Group 3 (Composite) at 327 ± 2.16 and lowest in Group 2 (GIC + SDF) at 283 ± 1.95. Results were statistically significant with a p value < 0.05. CONCLUSION: SDF conditioning negatively impacted microhardness and increased microleakage, which could negatively impact the longevity of restorations. Therefore, in this study, SDF was not suitable as a treatment to decrease the occurrence of secondary caries."

      "abstract": "Fluoride is an essential trace element required for normal physiological functions and holds significant importance for human health. However, excessive fluoride intake can lead to renal damage, for which effective prevention and therapeutic strategies remain scarce. Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), a major bioactive component of the traditional Chinese herb Astragalus membranaceus, possesses pharmacological properties including anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antioxidant activities. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of APS against fluoride-induced renal injury in vivo experiment. Additionally, network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques were employed to predict its potential mechanisms of action, while the protein expression levels of key target molecules were validated. The results demonstrated that APS intervention significantly alleviated renal injury and oxidative stress induced by sodium fluoride (NaF) in rats. Key targets involved in the amelioration of fluoride-induced renal damage by APS included STAT3, Caspase-3, JUN, MMP1, and PTGS2. Molecular docking analysis revealed high-affinity binding between APS and these core targets. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis further confirmed that APS suppressed the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins STAT3, Caspase-3, JUN, and MMP1 while enhancing the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein PTGS2. Overall, our findings suggest that APS alleviates fluoride-induced renal injury by modulating multiple targets, with the potential mechanism linked to the regulation of apoptotic processes. This study provides a theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of fluoride toxicity.",

This study aimed to evaluate the taste acceptance of different fluoride varnish preparations among children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in a clinical setting. Methods: This parallel-arm single-blinded randomized clinical study included autistic children aged 6-14 years, referred to a community dental clinic unit for preventive dental care. Non-verbal behavior, as a measure of taste acceptance, was assessed using the Frankl behavior rating scale. Additionally, subjective taste responses were recorded using a 3-point facial hedonic scale. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the chi-square test. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in non-verbal behavior between the three fluoride varnish groups before application (p = 0.094) or immediately after application (p = 0.718). However, when comparing pre- and post-application responses within each group, Duraphat® showed a significant improvement in non-verbal behavior (p = 0.020), while no significant changes were observed for Profluorid® (p = 0.196) or MI Varnish® (p = 0.704). Subjective taste acceptance, as measured by the 3-point facial hedonic scale, showed no significant differences among the varnish groups (p = 0.406). Conclusions: Flavored fluoride varnishes may improve the compliance of autistic children with preventive oral care procedures. Although no significant differences in taste acceptance were observed among the three varnishes, Duraphat® was associated with a significant improvement in non-verbal positive behavior, suggesting a more favorable response in autistic children."

      "abstract": "Objective: This study evaluated the effects of adding casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP), with and without fluoride, to a laboratory toothpaste on the inhibition of enamel demineralization under pH cycling conditions. Methods and Materials: A total of 44 enamel blocks were prepared. Samples were randomly divided into four groups: Group 1-Basic laboratory toothpaste as control; Group 2-Laboratory toothpaste containing 1100 ppm sodium fluoride; Group 3-Laboratory toothpaste containing 1% w/w CPP-ACPF; Group 4-Laboratory toothpaste containing 1% w/w CPP-ACP. Half of each enamel block was coated with nail varnish (sound area), and the other half was subjected to pH cycling for 10 days. During this period, the samples were immersed in a demineralization solution for three separate periods of 1 h each (3 h in total). In the remaining intervals, they were immersed in a remineralization solution (21 h in total). After the first step of demineralization, samples were immersed in an aqueous solution of the toothpaste and distilled water for 6 min. Vickers microhardness was measured at depths of 20, 50, and 120 μm. Results: The relative demineralization (rDEM) index in all treatment groups was significantly smaller than that in the control group. Binary analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the rDEM among the treatment groups, regardless of depth. Tukey's post hoc test revealed that the amount of hardness reduction due to the pH cycle was significant in all groups and at all depths, except for Group 4 at 50 and 120 μm depth. Therefore, CPP-ACP is more effective in preventing demineralization. Conclusion: All three remineralizing agents inhibited enamel demineralization; however, CPP-ACP was more effective at depths of 50 and 120 μm."

      "abstract": "Fluoride exposure during pregnancy commonly compromises fetal neurodevelopment and largely results in a broad spectrum of cognitive deficiencies in the adult offspring. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be fully elucidated. Herein, we investigate the impacts of fluoride on neural excitability and apoptosis, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function, as well as possible underlying mechanisms. Our results indicated that exposure to a high sodium fluoride (100 mg/L) during pregnancy in the mouse can cause the cognitive deficits of their offspring, accompanied by a decrease in the expression of Tet-eleven translocation protein 1 (TET1), an enzyme responsible for DNA hydroxymethylation. Additionally, there is a reduction in the dendritic spine density and the expression of postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) in the hippocampal regions of male offspring. Furthermore, in vitro fluoride treatment significantly exacerbates neuronal apoptosis and reduces the frequency of spikes in spontaneous action potential. More significantly, we also found that TET1 could directly bind to the promotor region of Bcl2, altering its DNA hydroxymethylation and Bcl2 expression. Intriguingly, Tet1 knock-out mice exhibited cognitive deficits similar to those observed in male animals exposed to high levels of fluoride. Furthermore, the down-regulation of TET1 protein, along with the consequent alteration in Bcl2 hydroxymethylation and increased neuronal apoptosis, are likely mechanisms underlying the impact of prenatal fluoride exposure on the neurodevelopment of male offspring. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which fluoride exposure induces neurodevelopmental impairment of the male offspring.",

When fluoride intake is excessive, it can cause various impairments in living organism. This review aims to assess the relationship between fluoride exposure and glucose metabolism, considering positive, negative, and null findings, with a focus on its potential role in insulin resistance and diabetes-related complications. METHODS: Numerous studies that have demonstrated changes in blood glucose and insulin variations due to fluoride are included in our analysis on the bases of their relevance. Twenty significant research papers from Pubmed, Google Scholar, and Research Gate are included up to January 2025 using search terms such as \"Fluoride,\" \"Toxicity,\" \"Diabetes,\" \"Insulin resistance,\" \"fluoride and diabetes,\" \"fluoride and insulin,\" \"fluoride and blood glucose\" in this review. Of the 20 research papers, 14 involve normal organisms unaffected by diabetes or complications connected to the disease, serving as standard animal models, while 5 involve animals exposed to diabetes and 1 is a human population study. RESULTS: The findings suggest a negative association between fluoride exposure and diabetes, as studies indicate fluoride's potential role in impairing glucose homeostasis and increasing insulin resistance. These research studies showed how fluoride affected the participants' blood sugar and diabetes-related complications. CONCLUSION: This study highlights how important it is to comprehend how fluoride may contribute to diabetes or diabetes-related complications, and it makes recommendations for future research directions that might lead to the discovery of efficient treatment measures to avoid them.",

      "abstract": "New acid-resistant glass ionomer cements (GIC) claim to be able to withstand acidic conditions while also protecting surrounding tooth structures and preserving function. Currently, there are only a few studies that assessed mechanical properties, ion release, and changes that occur around an acid-resistant GIC-dentine bonded interface under acidic conditions. This study aims to investigate the mechanical properties and fluoride release of GIC and the dentine hardness changes of the tooth that occur near the GIC-dentine bonded interface under in vitro conditions simulating carious and erosive challenges. A total of 96 beam-shaped specimens (2 mm × 2 mm × 25 mm) were prepared from two types of GIC and placed in neutral pH, carious, and erosive conditions for a total of 3 days over 2 time points to determine the flexural strength change and fluoride release. Twenty-four bovine teeth specimens with a 3 mm × 2 mm diameter cavity restored by two GICs (Fuji BULK (acid-resistant GIC)), Fuji IX Extra (conventional GIC) were subjected to carious (pH 4.4) and erosive (pH 2.3) conditions for 8 and 10 days, respectively. Hardness tests of the dentin surrounding the restorative material were conducted on the surface and cross-sectional interface. Data was tested for significant differences (α = 0.05) utilizing three-way analysis of variance with a Bonferroni post hoc test for multiple comparisons. No significant differences were observed in all comparisons of flexural strength between acid-resistant (~32 MPa) and conventional GICs (~26 MPa). Significant differences were observed in the fluoride release (p < 0.05) between different acidic environments for the same material, between different time points for the same material, and between different materials for day 1 in all conditions. The largest difference in fluoride release between conventional and acid-resistant GIC occurred on day 1 in the control groups, where the fluoride release was 63.1 and 28.2 ppm, respectively. This difference dropped substantially by day 3, where the ppm for conventional and acid-resistant GIC measured 11.9 and 3.9 ppm, respectively. Under carious and erosive conditions, both conventional and acid-resistant GIC showed higher fluoride releases, with erosive conditions showing sustained high fluoride releases of 60.1 and 55.2 ppm, respectively. Overall percent mass for the erosive condition from day 1 to day 3 decreased by 55.5% and 47.1% for conventional and acid-resistant GIC, respectively. A significant difference in dentine hardness (p < 0.001) was observed under erosive treatment between conventional and acid-resistant GIC at both the surface (0.27 GPa vs. 0.36 GPa) and cross-sectional (0.24 GPa vs. 0.32 GPa) sites, respectively. A significant difference in hardness (p < 0.001) was observed for acid-resistant and conventional GIC between all conditions, except between carious and erosive for the acid-resistant GIC. In conclusion, acid-resistant GIC was more resistant to demineralization on regions surrounding the restored cavity under erosive conditions compared to conventional GIC. There were no significant differences in flexural strength observed between acid-resistant and conventional GIC for all conditions, while initial fluoride release for conventional GIC was found to be slightly higher compared to the acid-resistant GIC.",

In this study, we established an F2 rat model and an NG108-15 cell model to investigate the potential modes of action. The autophagy of F2 rat hippocampal neurons and NG108-15 cells was assessed using transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence/immunocytochemistry kit, respectively. Hippocampal morphology was evaluated via hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. We measured mRNA levels of AMPK, mTOR, ULK1, and LC3 using quantitative reverse transcription PCR, and protein expressions were analyzed by Western blotting. Following treatment with rapamycin (Rap) in FA-exposed F2 rats and NG108-15 cells, a small number of primary lysosomes and autophagosomes appeared within hippocampal cells, with HE staining indicating a near-normal restoration of pyramidal cell morphology. The quantity, intensity, and volume of green fluorescent spots in the cytoplasm of NG108-15 cells increased as observed through fluorescence microscopy. The mRNA expressions of AMPK, ULK1, and LC3 were upregulated while mTOR expressions were downregulated in NG108-15 cells. Correspondingly, protein levels for AMPK, p-AMPK, ULK1, p-ULK1 along with the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio increased whereas those for mTOR, p-mTOR and p62 decreased significantly. Similar trends regarding both mRNA and protein expression were noted within the hippocampus of F2 rats as well. Activation of the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathway by Rap enhances FA-induced autophagy thereby mitigating neuronal damage.",

      "abstract": "High fluoride exposure was widely demonstrated to be related with brain memory impairment. Since the absorption of F- enters the body mainly through the gastrointestinal tract, studying the effects of excessive intake of fluoride on brain memory function in various gut microbiome states might have profound implications for the prevention of fluorosis because growing evidence revealed the significance of the \"microbiota-gut-brain\" axis (MGBA). In the present study, we aimed to illustrate the potential mechanism of gut microbiota on high fluoride exposure-induced hippocampal lesions and spatial memory dysfunction in mice by the various intestinal microecological environments, which were constructed by antibiotic treatment. Mice fed with normal (CG1 and Exp1 groups) or sodium-fluoride (CG2 and Exp2 groups; 24 mg/kg sodium fluoride per mouse) by gavage administration with or without antibiotic treatments, a combination of metronidazole (1 g/L) and ciprofloxacin (0.2 g/L) in drinking water. Mice gavaged with excessive sodium fluoride alone exhibited reduced weight gain, hippocampal tissue damages, spatial memory levels dysfunction, impaired intestinal permeability, decreased inflammatory cytokines expression and antioxidant capability in the hippocampal and ileal tissues. In contrast, antibiotic intervention significantly reversed these high fluoride exposure-induced hippocampal and ileal changes.16S rRNA high throughput sequencing found that ileal microbiota were dominated by abundant taxa, which is conducive to constructing microbial interaction networks and module communities, and identifying keystone species targeted by high fluoride exposure compared with colonic microbiome. In addition, the microbial community composition and assembly mechanism of ileal microbiome under the effects of antibiotics were suitable for revealing the characteristics of high fluoride environment. In the later analysis, Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, Muribaculaceae and Robinsoniella were considered as the keystone species targeted by high fluoride-exposed mice based on the analysis of network node properties and niche overlap of ileal microbes. Spearman rank correlation demonstrated that these keystone species had significant effects on hippocampal memory levels and intestinal health, as well as microbial communities functions. Compared to previous researches, this study further revealed intestinal microbial coummunity mediated the underlying mechanism through antibiotic treatment against high fluoride-induce hippocampal spatial memory impairment.",

To prevent the onset and progression, identification of early erosive lesions as well as increased knowledge of the preventive treatment possibilities is of the importance. The aim of this study is to compare the protective effects of various fluoride compounds against dental erosion utilizing an established mouse model. METHODS: Three groups of ten young CD-1 mice were provided cola drink ad libitum during six weeks. Fluoride solutions containing metal components, TiF₄ (0.5 mol/l, pH 1.2, 9500 ppm F) and SnF₂ (0.5 mol/l, pH 2.6, 9500 ppm F), and a non-metal fluoride, NaF (0.5 mol/l, pH 8, 9500 ppm F) were applied to the molars under sedation twice a week. Additionally, one positive (acidic drink) and one negative (distilled water) control group were included. Mandibular molars were thereafter dissected and analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The first molars were transversely ground, observed by SEM, and tooth height and dental hard tissue loss were measured. Further, pulp structure was described. RESULTS: The application of metal fluorides, TiF₄ and SnF₂, resulted in the formation of a protective coating layer on the molars. The overall protective effects of fluoride compounds on the development of dental erosion were evident in increasing succession from NaF, TiF₄ to SnF₂. Molars applied NaF showed a 6% reduction in tooth tissue loss compared to the untreated positive control molars. TiF₄ and SnF₂ treated molars continued to display decreased tooth tissue loss by 37% and 67%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The metal fluorides offer superior protection against dental erosion compared to the traditional fluoride compound. The results particularly emphasize the protective effect of SnF₂, which was most effective in preserving enamel structure and minimizing dentin exposure. This suggests that SnF₂ could be an effective option for preventing dental erosions.",

      "abstract": "The textile printing/dyeing (TPD) wastewater poses a serious threat to ecological safety, and it is essential and challenging to alleviate this environmental issue. The sunlight-driven catalysis technology is a promising strategy for wastewater purification. However, the photostability and recyclability of highly active photocatalysts are the main factors limiting its application in wastewater treatment. Herein, a double-shell Sb2S3/CdS/Ag2S (SCA) ternary nanorods with type-II and type-I exciton dynamics was constructed to prepare the polyvinylidene fluoride networked hybrid membrane (PVDF/SCA). Due to the synergistically interacted multi-phase interfaces and superior recyclability, this hybrid membrane exhibited excellent piezo-photocatalytic in-depth purification ability of industrial discharged TPD wastewater under the collaborative drives of ultrasonic mechanical energy and light energy following by a durably stable catalytic performance, surpassing most reported environmental photocatalysts. This study proposes a feasible strategy for in-depth treatment of industrial discharged TPD wastewater to acceptable levels for discharge."

This study aimed to investigate the protective role of anthocyanins in fluoride-induced neurological damage due to endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). Using a fluoride-exposed Wistar rat model, we assessed learning memory capacity and pathologic and ultrastructural injury. The level of oxidative stress (OS) in vivo was detected by colorimetric method, the level of ERS was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and the apoptosis of neuronal cells was observed by TUNEL staining. The results showed that fluoride exposure could decrease the learning and memory ability in rats, and led to histopathological and ultrastructural damage in the hippocampal CA1, CA3 and cortical regions. Fluoride exposure-induced OS in vivo, which further activates ERS, which was manifested by increased levels of ERS-related proteins GRP78, Caspase 12, and Caspase 3 in hippocampal CA1, CA3, and cortical regions, and eventually led to a significant increase in neuronal apoptosis rate. Notably, after anthocyanins treatment, pathological and ultrastructural damage was restored, the level of OS and ERS were significantly restored, and the apoptosis rate of neuronal cells was significantly reduced. In summary, as nutritional interventions, anthocyanins exert a protective role in fluoride-induced neurological injury.",

However, the current progress suffers from the interference of extremely high concentration of F- and undesired purity of the final uranium product. Herein, we constructed the neighboring ensemble Lewis acid-base pair sites (ensemble Lewis sites) in bismuth oxides as the extraction material, which was integrated into a designed tandem electrochemical device for efficient recovery of high-purity uranium from real nuclear wastewater. The mechanistic study revealed that the ensemble Lewis sites dramatically enhance the binding of all dominant uranyl fluoride (UO2Fx) species through the simultaneous strengthened chemical bonds with U, O, and F atoms. Besides, the tandem electrochemical device rationally controlled the reaction period to U3O8, avoiding the undesired crystalline transformation to K2U2O7. Through 3 h electrolysis in 1 L of real nuclear wastewater, the extraction efficiency of uranium reached 99.9 % with only 2.2 % impurities of alkali metals in extracted uranium product, outperforming the previous work. This study offers an effective method for the recovery of uranium resources in real nuclear wastewater."

The fluoride adsorption capacity of the CeO2/ATP composite was systematically evaluated, reaching a maximum of 47.84 mg/g. Kinetic analysis revealed that fluoride uptake followed a pseudo-second-order model, suggesting a chemisorption-dominated process. Furthermore, isothermal adsorption experiments conducted within a concentration range of 10 mg/L to 260 mg/L demonstrated that the adsorption process fit the Langmuir isotherm model. To evaluate the potential for commercial use, five consecutive reusability tests were performed, showing a sustained adsorption capacity of 30.2 mg/g. The CeO2/ATP composite demonstrates effective fluoride removal capabilities and good recyclability, highlighting its potential for practical applications in water treatment."

A better outcome can be achieved with electrochemical dissolution without mechanical injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Several electrochemical dissolution solutions are being used including artificial saliva, Tyrode's solution, and sodium fluoride (NaF). These electrolytes were prepared and their respective electrochemical characterization was done before conducting the assay. The present in vitro study compares the possible cytotoxic effect and viability of periodontal ligament cells in artificial saliva, Tyrode's solution, and NaF using an MTT assay. RESULTS: The comparative analyses of the cell viability and toxicity effects of the electrolytes considered are reported. It was observed that the Artificial saliva (before dissolution: 84.10±11.32; after dissolution: 69.1±11.32) and Tyrode's solution (before dissolution: 77.30±4.11; after dissolution: 61.3±4.11) showed higher cell viability percentages and comparatively reduced toxicity levels before and after dissolution compared to NaF (before dissolution: 36.01±5.27; after dissolution: 11.01±5.27). Statistical analysis of the results observed before and after dissolution provided a significant difference (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The artificial saliva and the Tyrode's solution may be considered as a potential electrochemical dissolution solution during the surgery to achieve a better outcome."

This paper aims to evaluate the outcomes of SDF use in older adults in a dental school setting using a retrospective cohort analysis of electronic health records over a period of 2 years. METHODS: A total of 169 patient records were selected for survival analysis after screening using the selection criteria. Demographic and treatment variables were collected. Multivariable Accelerated failure time (AFT) models were used to evaluate relationships between the survival of teeth that received SDF treatment and available variables. RESULTS: The 24-month survival for the whole sample of patients was found to be 45%. Patients who had SDF reapplied after an initial SDF treatment had a greater increase in the length of time until tooth failure than did those who only received an initial SDF treatment over a 2-year period. For patients receiving SDF treatment, those with more baseline restorative treatments experienced tooth failure more quickly than did those with fewer such treatments. We found a low to moderate association between survival times and the number of sites where SDF was applied, and between survival times and prescription of high-fluoride toothpaste. CONCLUSION: In older adults receiving SDF application, multiple reapplications at the site prolonged survival time while poorer outcomes were seen in patients who had higher baseline restorative treatment needs.",

METHODS: Ginger, Ashwaghanda and Maca extracts were prepared by solvent extraction methodology and were characterized using transmission electron microscope, dynamic light scattering, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer. The pH of the dentifrices was evaluated by pH meter. Eighty teeth were collected and divided into five groups according to the treatment protocol. Enamel morphology was carried out by scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy for the analysis of calcium, phosphorus, Ca/P ratio and carbon. Surface microhardness was evaluated by Vickers micro-hardness tester. Data were analyzed using One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test (p ≤ 0.05). RESULTS: Characterization results showed the highest calcium, phosphorus and fluoride ion release were associated to Maca, Ashwaganda and Ginger respectively. The pH results revealed that Ginger dentifrice exhibited the most alkaline pH, whereas Ashwaganda dentifrice exhibited the most acidic pH. Morphological analysis revealed that Ashwaganda showed lower remineralization ability compared to the other treated groups. Maca showed significant higher Ca/P ratio compared to other groups (p < 0.001) and Ginger showed significant higher surface microhardness recovery compared to Ashwaganda (p < 0.001).

It has been used to evaluate quantitatively DFT approaches with 52 functionals and 4 composite methods. Two widely used indirect anchor-point methods based on isodesmic reactions with fluorophosgene or the trimethyl silyl cation are compared to the direct computation of the FIA. It has been frequently stated that anchor-point methods are to be strongly preferred over direct FIA computations at DFT levels, as they avoid treatment of the naked fluoride ion. Here it is shown that this widespread assumption does not hold when modern functionals with low self-interaction errors and suitable basis sets with diffuse functions are used. In these cases, an anchor-point approach based on  OCF 2 ${{\\rm{OCF}}_2 }$   has little or no advantage, and the widely used anchor-point calculations based on   Me 3 Si +  ${{\\rm{Me}}_3 {\\rm{Si}}^+ }$   even deteriorate results in most cases. It is shown that this is due to a break-down of often prevailing error cancellations in the anchor-point approach that help to improve results when using less suitable functionals or basis sets. Overall, the direct computation of FIAs at appropriate DFT levels including diffuse basis functions is the clearly preferable route."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is an effective treatment for arresting caries, though its success for interproximal caries varies. This in vitro study aimed to evaluate the delivery of SDF to initial interproximal caries with three delivery methods using a tooth-to-tooth interproximal contact model. METHODS: Extracted permanent premolars were randomly allocated to one of three experimental groups: microbrush, dental floss, Super Floss®, and two control groups. Randomly paired premolars were mounted on a tooth-to-tooth interproximal contact model and artificial carious lesions induced. SDF was delivered with the three delivery methods. The amount and successful delivery of SDF was evaluated with three proxy measures: percentage white spot lesion (WSL) area and depth stained with SDF, and percentage change in mineral density after remineralization. RESULTS: Forty-two premolar pairs were included. The percentage of WSL area stained with SDF in the Super Floss® (93.05 ± 6.52) and dental floss (81.92 ± 20.15) groups were significantly (p < 0.001) higher than the microbrush (33.24 ± 39.01) group; the percentage of WSL depth stained with SDF in the Super Floss® (185.75 ± 51.61) group was significantly (p = 0.007) higher than the microbrush (52.07 ± 81.11) group. There was no difference in the mineral density percentage change between the three groups. CONCLUSION: Effectiveness of SDF delivery to interproximal caries was greatest with Super Floss®, followed by dental floss and then microbrush, with no significant differences between the floss groups. This study serves as a proof of concept prior to validating these methods in clinical settings. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In this in vitro study, SDF was delivered to initial interproximal caries most effectively using Super Floss®, followed by dental floss and then microbrush. Clinical studies are required to validate the results in clinical settings.",

With its potential to significantly impact the field, this review aims to assess the efficacy of antioxidant agents in murine models exhibiting fluorosis-induced toxicity. By transferring electrons to oxidizing agents, antioxidants can attenuate oxidation reactions and mitigate cellular damage. METHODOLOGY: This systematic review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, encompassing articles investigating the impact of antioxidant substances on murine fluorosis models, explicitly focusing on oxidative stress markers and antioxidant levels across various tissues. RESULTS: A qualitative synthesis of 79 articles highlights antioxidant agents such as vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, carotenoids, polyphenolic compounds (including flavonoids and polyphenolic acids), amino acids, and others among animals with fluorosis induction showed variations in oxidative stress markers and antioxidant activity levels under different administration protocols compared to those receiving prophylactic, concomitant concurrent, or therapeutic antioxidant treatments. CONCLUSION: Fluoride administration across diverse doses and durations elicits heightened oxidative stress markers in multiple rodent tissues. The current evidence suggests that some antioxidants are effective as a prophylactic and concurrent in murine models of fluorosis. However, the methodological differences between studies prevent the establishment of a protocol for potential standardized use.",

In this study, a novel polyvinylidene fluoride and zeolite nanocomposite membrane, embedded with manganese phosphate (PVDF+Ze@MP), was prepared via the sol-gel method. This membrane demonstrated excellent ion exchange properties, and thermal, mechanical, and chemical stability. It showed resilience in both acidic and basic environments, with no visible degradation, and maintained a thickness of 0.085 cm and a water uptake of 0.070%. The structural configuration of PVDF+Ze@MP was ascertained by SEM, XRD, and FTIR, whereas the thermal properties were examined using TGA analysis. Electrochemical analysis, based on the Teorell-Meyer-Sievers (TMS) model, revealed that charge density significantly influenced ion transport and separation efficiency. The membrane exhibited high cation selectivity, with the membrane potential increasing as the electrolyte concentration decreased, indicating its ability to selectively transport specific ions. Additionally, performance metrics for mobility ratio, transport number, and membrane potential followed the trend KHCO3 < NaHCO3 < KCl < NaCl except for fixed charge density, which followed the reverse order highlighting the membrane's adaptability for efficient ion separation. The novelty of this work lies in the synergistic integration of PVDF, zeolites, and manganese phosphate to create a composite membrane with enhanced stability and selective ion exchange performance, making it a strong candidate for challenging water treatment applications. With superior electrochemical properties, low fouling behavior, and robust thermal and mechanical stability, this membrane holds strong potential for practical implementation in desalination and ion exchange processes."

Therefore, mitigating the oxidative stress induced by fluorosis has become a significant research concern. Consequently, how to relieve oxidative stress caused by fluorosis is an urgent matter. In the present study, intestinal porcine epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells were chosen to explore the underlying mechanism of tea polyphenols (TPs) on F-induced oxidative stress. The results show that the cytotoxicity of IPEC-J2 cells induced by F presented a dose-dependent manner according to cell viability. Additionally, F treatment inhibited the activity of T-SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px as well as their transcription levels, increased the reactive oxygen (ROS) formation and cell damage rates, and then promoted cell apoptosis through the results of TUNEL and mitochondrial membrane potential detection when compared with the IPEC-J2 cells from the control group. As the main antioxidant ingredient in tea, TPs alleviated F-induced cell oxidation and apoptosis via blocking F-induced ROS generation and LDH's release, as well as promoting the transcription of tight junction (TJ) proteins and the activities of antioxidant enzymes in IPEC-J2 cells. These results provide a new treatment strategy for F-induced intestinal oxidative impairment."

The aim of this study was to explore the protective effects of two highly fluoridated products, silver fluoride solution (silver diamine fluoride-potassium iodide solution, SDF-KI) and fluoride varnish, on dental erosion in mouse. Methods: Two groups of ten young CD-1 mouse were given a cola drink ad libitum over a 6-week period. A prophylactic treatment with a silver fluoride solution (38% SDF 48,000 ppm F with a silver concentration of 253,900 ppm) and a fluoride varnish (NaF, 22,600 ppm F) were applied on the mandibular molars, performed under sedation twice a week during the whole experiment. Furthermore, two control groups of ten mice were included, a positive (cola drink) and a negative (distilled water) control. A terminal procedure was followed by dissection of mandibular molars and analysis of them using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The first molars were transversely ground, further analyzed by SEM, and measured for tooth height and tooth tissue loss. Results: Analyses of mandibular molars treated with a fluoride varnish indicated a 5% decreased tooth tissue loss, compared to the molars which served as a positive control. The best effect was achieved with the application of silver fluoride solution, displaying a 35% decreased tooth tissue loss compared to the positive control group. Conclusions: Preventive treatment with a solution of silver fluoride solution exhibits greater protection against dental erosion compared to a traditional fluoride varnish. This study indicates that silver fluoride solution is an effective fluoride compound and is highly beneficial in a clinical setting with the aim of preventing dental erosion."

      "abstract": "Aim: To compare caregiver satisfaction and children's acceptance of silver fluoride/potassium iodide (AgF + KI) treatment (Riva Star Aqua®, SDI Limited, Victoria, Australia) and glass-ionomer cement (GIC) application (Ionostar Plus + Easy Glaze, VOCO, Germany) in reducing hypersensitivity in permanent molars affected by molar incisor hypomineralisation (MIH) with the MIH treatment need index (MIH-TNI) 3 and 4 immediately after its application and after 12 weeks. Materials and Methods: This prospective, comparative, clinical study recruited schoolchildren with at least one hypersensitive MIH molar with a Schiff cold air sensitivity score (SCASS) of 2 and 3. Caregivers in both groups (AgF + KI and GIC + glaze) answered a questionnaire (5-Point Likert Scale) regarding the perception of the treatment immediately (15 min post application) and in the 12 weeks follow-up. Children's behaviour during both applications was assessed using FBRS (Frankl Behaviour Rating Scale). Results: A total number of 47 children (n = 22 for AgF/KI and n = 25 for GIC) with a mean age of 8.6 ± 1.42 were recruited. A high proportion of the children in both arms (n = 40 out of 44; 90.1%) reported a reduction in hypersensitivity in the last 12 weeks. On average, children (n = 39; FBRS ≥ 3) in both groups showed positive behaviour, with a significantly more definitely positive behaviour in the GIC group (p < 0.05, independent student t-test). Caregiver satisfaction with both study procedures was high after immediate assessment (n = 19 out of 22, 86.4% for AgF/KI and n = 19 out of 25, 76.0% for GIC application) and in 12 weeks of follow-up (n = 17 out of 20, 85.0% for AgF/KI and n = 22 out of 24, 91.6% for GIC application). However, the taste AgF/KI is more frequently considered not acceptable for the child (n = 10; 45%) than smell (n = 2; 9%). Interestingly, there was a statistically significant difference in caregivers' preference toward alternative desensitisation treatment (tooth restoration coverage, desensitisation paste, stainless steel crown and fluoride varnish) in both treatment groups (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). Conclusions: Both GIC and AgF/KI applications can be considered acceptable approaches to reduce hypersensitivity in permanent molars affected by MIH both immediately and in long-term follow-up for schoolchildren based on caregivers' assessments."

The study evaluates and compares the efficacy of these two on plaque accumulation, gingival health, and demineralization in vivo, as well as shear bond strength in vitro. METHODS: This study was conducted using 45 extracted premolars for the in vitro group and 45 patients for the in vivo group. Each group was further subdivided into three subgroups of 15 each. In the in vitro subgroups, bonding in Subgroup I (control group) was done using Transbond XT, Subgroup II (fluoride varnish group) involved the application of fluoride varnish using Fluor Protector, and Subgroup III (Transbond Plus Color Change Adhesive) was used for bonding. Shear bond strength was evaluated in the in vitro group using a universal testing machine. In the three in vivo subgroups, bonding was done similarly to the in vitro group. The efficacy was assessed in vivo using the plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), and demineralization index at T0 (baseline), T1 (week 4), T2 (week 8), and T3 (week 12). RESULTS: The results demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the inter- and intragroup comparisons of the PI and GI, whereas the demineralization index group did not show any statistically significant difference, as indicated by ANOVA, Tukey's test, and paired t-tests. The in vitro group showed statistically significant differences between the fluoride varnish group and both the control group and the fluoridated composite group. CONCLUSION: Fluoride-releasing orthodontic composite and fluoridated varnish can be used to prevent plaque accumulation and demineralization and maintain gingival health during fixed orthodontic therapy."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Fixed orthodontic appliances are associated with higher levels of plaque and saliva bacteria, which contribute to dental caries. The effects of combining xylitol and fluoride, both used in caries prevention, are uncertain. Thus, this study assessed the combined impact of fluoride and xylitol varnish on bacteria in saliva and biofilms around orthodontic brackets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center, four-arm, parallel-group, triple-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted. A total of 120 patients who required fixed orthodontic treatment were included. Patients were sorted into one of the following groups at random: fluoride, xylitol, combined fluoride and xylitol, and control. Biofilm and saliva sampling was performed at two intervals: T0 (first session of bracket bonding, before application of the varnish) and T1 (6 weeks after application of the varnish). The number of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus was counted using the CFU method. RESULTS: The relative number of S. mutans and lactobacilli in saliva and biofilm significantly decreased following the application of fluoride and combined fluoride/xylitol varnish (p < 0.05) and were more effective than xylitol varnish. There was no significant difference between fluoride and combined fluoride/xylitol varnishes regarding changes in S. mutans and Lactobacillus colonies in saliva and dental biofilms. Additionally, there was no significant difference between xylitol and the two other active varnishes regarding reduction in biofilm S. mutans and Lactobacillus. CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference between fluoride and combined fluoride/xylitol varnishes regarding changes in the studied bacteria in saliva and dental biofilms, and they were more effective than xylitol varnish.

METHODS: The artificial initial caries lesions were created in 160 human enamel samples. The demineralizated samples were divided into five groups: resin infiltration (ICON; DMG, Hamburg, Germany), NaOCl + ICON, resin varnish (Clinpro XT; 3M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany), NaOCl + Clinpro XT, and a negative control group. Enamel samples that underwent thermocycling aging were subjected to 5.000 cycles between 5-55 °C (N = 32, n = 16 for aging subgroups). Surface roughness (Ra), Vicker's microhardness (VHN), and DIAGNOdent Pen (Kavo, Biberach, Germany) (DDP) values were recorded at the baseline, after demineralization, after treatment, and after the thermal aging stages. The micro-CT analysis, microleakage, and Scanning Electron Microscope images were evaluated after treatment procedures and thermal aging. Robust ANOVA, Pearson's chi-square, and McNemar tests were used for statistical analysis. The significance level was p < 0.05. RESULTS: The main effect of both group and stage was statistically significant for DDP, Ra, VHN, and micro-CT values. All treatment procedures improved the demineralized enamel compared to the negative control group (p < 0.001). The application of NaOCl (5.25 %) before resin infiltration increased microhardness but also in roughness. The resin-infiltrated groups showed less microleakage than the resin-varnish-treated groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The application of NaOCl prior to resin infiltration or resin varnish did not result in any important alterations in the examined parameter values.",

      "abstract": "Argyrodites are among the most promising sulfide-based solid electrolytes (SEs) due to their high ionic conductivity and ductility. However, the poor atmospheric stability of sulfide-based SEs caused by the side reaction with moisture, which generates toxic H2S gas and degrades its high ionic conductivity and low electronic conductivity, has limited the commercialization of ASSBs. Herein, the preparation of sulfide-based SEs consisting of a Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) core and fluoride-rich LPSCl shell are described using a facial fluorine treatment following an annealing process to improve atmospheric stability. Most importantly, with the benefit of a fluoride-rich LPSCl shell, the prepared SE exhibits well-kept low electronic conductivity even after exposure to an atmosphere with 20% relative humidity at 25 °C, resulting in an improvement in electrochemical properties without short-circuiting. These results indicate that the fluoride-rich LPSCl shell effectively suppresses side reactions with moisture and mitigates the extent of irreversible side reactions. These experimental results and associated first-principles density functional theory (DFT) models profoundly understand the enhanced air stability of F-LPSCl. Full cells employing an air-exposed F-LPSCl exhibit an enhanced initial discharge capacity of 168.5 mAh g-1 at 0.05 C, cycling stability at 0.3 C over 500 cycles, and rate capability."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine rates of fluoride varnish (FV) application at a tertiary care center between 2018 and 2021 and factors associated with receipt of FV application in the medical setting. DESIGN: A retrospective chart review and case-control study, matching children who had received FV application and those who had not during a well-child examination, were conducted. MEASURES: Current Procedural and Dental Terminology and International Classification of Diseases codes from an electronic medical record were used to determine the rates of FV application. ANALYTIC STRATEGY: Bivariate and multivariable analyses were conducted to determine factors associated with FV application. RESULTS: The rate of fluoride applications was low but increased significantly from 0.1% in 2018 to 1.6% in 2020 (P < .0001). Among White, Black, and Hispanic subjects, 39.5%, 65.2%, and 68.9%, respectively, received FV application during well-child exams. Advanced registered nurse practitioners (ARNPs) and physician assistants (PAs) provided 0.05% of FV applications. Multivariable results for 788 patients identified \"Black, Hispanic, or other\" race and ethnicity or Medicaid insurance type as factors positively associated with receipt of medical FV. DISCUSSION: This study showed an increase in FV application rates, which may be attributed to a quality improvement project and provider advocates. The prevalence was low and analyses show race and ethnicity and insurance factors associated with the receipt of FV application. CONCLUSION: The associated factors suggest medical clinicians may evaluate race and ethnicity or insurance type to determine FV recipients. The results showed ARNPs and PAs may be underutilized clinicians for this preventive treatment.",

      "abstract": "The activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) by cobalt-based catalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants has been widely studied, while the role of coexisting anions has received little attention. In this study, the performance of atrazine (ATZ) degradation by the addition of fluoride ions (F-) in the activation of PMS by cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) was investigated. The addition of F- to the CoFe2O4/PMS system increased ATZ degradation effect from 82 % to 98 % within 10 min, and the rate increased from 0.172 min-1 to 0.431 min-1. At the same time, F- could also enhance the degradation of organic substances such as sulfamethoxazole (SMX), ibuprofen, and iohexol. Based on generating SO4•-, HO• and Co(IV)=O in the CoFe2O4/PMS system, F- enhanced the generation of SO4•-. When coexisting with common substances in water (i.e., inorganic anions, humic acid, hemoglobin and dextran), F- can still increase the reaction rate and reduce their negative impacts. Ion dissolution and control tests verified Co as a valid active site. A potential reaction mechanism was proposed for the complex Co(II)F formation with Co by F-, which enhanced the activation of the PMS by CoFe2O4 and regulated the active species. Finally, it was verified that the low concentration of F- could enhance ATZ degradation within two hours and the remaining F- could be effectively removed by flocculation and precipitation. This research takes utilization of F- in wastewater to promote advanced oxidation processes based on PMS, which provides a new direction for the treatment of actual water pollution."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RM-GIC) is widely used in clinical dental procedures as a restorative material due to its chemical composition. It is known for its strong adhesion to dental structures and its fluoride content. However, fluoride in RM-GIC is insufficient for preventing the formation of carious lesions, making the use of fluoride gel and varnish necessary as preventive strategies. Nevertheless, there may be adverse interactions between RM-GIC and fluoride, which could compromise the properties of these restorative materials. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the physicochemical and biological properties of the products used in dental treatments. This experimental study aimed to evaluate the effect of the following fluorides: 2% neutral sodium fluoride (NaF), 1.23% acidulated phosphate fluoride (APF), and 0.1% fluoride varnish (7700 ppm F) in the mi-cro-hardness of the RM-GIC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using GC Fuji II LC-A2, 80 RM-GIC discs measuring 6cm x 4cm were made and immersed in artificial saliva for seven days. Then, the discs were washed, dried, and randomly divided into four groups, and the initial surface microhardness was measured. After that, the discs were immersed in the three fluorides to measure the microhardness for a second time. The average value of the surface microhardness of the RM-GIC in the final phase (exposure to fluorides) of the three experimental study groups is lower than the initial phase (non-exposure to fluorides). RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the microhardness of the ionomer with the application of the three fluorides (p= 3.6x10-12). Particularly, the treatment with 1.23% acidulated phosphate fluoride demonstrated higher variation than 2% neutral sodium fluoride (p=0.0063) or 0.1% fluoride varnish (p=2.2x10-5). CONCLUSIONS: 2% neutral sodium fluoride, 1.23% acidulated phosphate fluoride, and 0.1% fluoride varnish (7700 ppm F) applied to RM-GIC decreases surface microhardness.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to develop and evaluate in vitro a varnish containing fluoride-doped glass ceramics capable of inhibiting oral microorganisms, releasing hydroxyapatite-forming ions, and ensuring biocompatibility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the production of the experimental varnish (VE), composed of hydrogenated rosin, 10% and 20% by weight of glass ceramics with composition S53P4 (CF0) and doped with F- ions (CF5 and CF10) were incorporated. The EVs were characterized by Rheology, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), FTIR, ion release (fluoride and calcium ions), cytotoxicity on VERO cells, and antimicrobial effect on S. mutans, S. aureus and C. albicans and anti-biofilm effect on S. mutans. The data were analyzed by One-Way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis test (P = 0.05). RESULTS: Homogeneous varnishes with good viscosity were obtained. Varnishes with 20% CF demonstrated biocompatibility and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at concentrations lower than 10 mg/mL and 3.12 mg/mL, respectively, except for C. albicans. An anti-biofilm effect on S. mutans was observed for the varnishes with 20% CF. All varnishes with CF released more F- than the commercial varnish, with V20CF10 standing out, which released 4 times more F- ions in a quarter of the time. CONCLUSIONS: The V20CF10 varnish is a promising material for dental use in the treatment of early caries lesions, due to its biocompatibility, antimicrobial properties, and release of hydroxyapatite-forming ions. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The use of a new varnish that combines antimicrobial properties with hydroxyapatite-forming ion release may prevent or halt the progression of dental caries lesions, offering greater efficacy than currently available varnishes.",

Several prevention methods such as fluoride therapy and laser irradiation have been proposed, but there is still no conclusive evidence. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the combined application of diode laser and fluoride varnish in preventing white spots. Methods: Thirty-nine sound human premolars were extracted for orthodontic purposes and randomly divided into three groups of thirteen teeth each (C: Control, FV: fluoride varnish (5% sodium fluoride), and FV+L: fluoride varnish+980 nm diode laser (2 W)). The freshly extracted teeth were disinfected in a 0.5% chloramine T solution and stored in saline at room temperature. Each tooth was coated with nail polish, leaving a 2×3 mm2 window on the midbuccal. Surface treatments were applied, and primary Vickers microhardness was evaluated in the gingival sections. Then, the samples were immersed in alternating demineralizing (6 hours/day) and remineralizing (18 hours/day) solutions and incubated at 37 °C for 9 days to produce artificial caries. Afterward, the samples were immersed in a remineralizing solution for one day. Finally, secondary microhardness was measured. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. Results: The primary microhardness was higher in groups C and FV than in group FV+L. The lowest secondary microhardness was recorded in group C, and there was no significant difference between the other two groups. The change in microhardness was greater in group C, while no difference was observed between the FV and FV+L groups. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, the combined application of laser irradiation and fluoride varnish may not improve white spot lesion (WSL) prevention compared to the use of fluoride varnish alone."

      "abstract": "Background and objective The effectiveness of various remineralizing agents, including fluoride varnish, casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP), and chicken eggshell powder (CESP), in improving enamel surface microhardness (SMH) is of clinical interest. This in vitro study aimed to evaluate and compare SMH changes in the enamel after treatment with these agents. Materials and methods An in vitro study was conducted in which 40 human premolars extracted for orthodontic reasons were sectioned into four enamel sections, which were randomly allocated into four groups: group A (fluoride varnish), group B (CPP-ACP cream), group C (CESP), and group D (control). Group A was treated with a thin layer of fluoride varnish (MI Varnish®, GC Corp., Tokyo, Japan), which was left to absorb for 20 s before air drying. Group B specimens were treated with CPP-ACP cream (GC Tooth Mousse®; GC Corp.) for at least three minutes. Group C received CESP application to the enamel surface, which was allowed to absorb for five minutes. Group D (the control group) did not receive any surface treatment. Artificial carious lesions were induced using a demineralization solution and pH cycling for five days. The treated samples were stored in artificial saliva for 21 days at 37 °C. The SMH was assessed using a Vickers microhardness tester at baseline, post-demineralization, and post-treatment. Statistical analyses included paired t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Tukey's post-hoc test. Results After demineralization, SMH significantly decreased in all groups (p<0.05). After treatment with various remineralizing agents, groups A, B, and C demonstrated significant improvement in SMH compared to the control group (p<0.05). Group C exhibited the greatest improvement in SMH, followed by groups A and B. The difference in the SMH between the treatment groups was statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusions All three remineralizing agents effectively increased SMH, with CESP showing superior results. Fluoride varnish and CPP-ACP also demonstrated substantial remineralization potential. Further in vivo studies are required to validate these findings in a clinical setting."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to assess parental acceptance of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) treatment for dental caries in children in Najaf city, Iraq. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used, involving 670 parents of children aged 6-7 years from primary schools in Najaf city, Iraq, during the academic year 2023-2024. The participants were selected via a multistage random sampling method. A structured questionnaire was administered to gather the participants' views on tooth staining caused by SDF application to cavitated teeth. Statistical procedures included descriptive analysis, chi-square tests, and ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: In total, 670 parents were recruited for this study. The mean age of the participants was 34.47 ± 8.2 Approximately half of the respondents were male and aged 31-50 years, and approximately three-fourths of the parents reported having a low education level and were in the low-income category. Parental acceptance of SDF treatment was greater for posterior teeth, with 51.2% agreeing, and 24.2% strongly agree. For anterior teeth, acceptance was lower, with only 23.3% agreeing and 10.7% strongly agreeing. Parental age (p = 0.008), education level (p < 0.001), and income (p = 0.003) were significantly associated with acceptance of SDF treatment for posterior teeth. However, for anterior teeth, parental education (p < 0.001) and income (p = 0.029) were significantly associated with acceptance of SDF treatment. CONCLUSION: Parents showed high acceptance of SDF treatment, particularly for posterior teeth, although concerns about aesthetics affected their views of anterior teeth. Improving parents' awareness and addressing their apprehensions could increase the adoption of this evidence-based caries management approach for children."

      "abstract": "The development of injectable bio-stimulating polycaprolactone (PCL) microspheres for wound healing has strict requirement on size and morphology control, particularly favoring microspheres within the range between 20-50 µm. PCL microspheres with smaller sizes are phagocyted at rapid rate while larger microspheres could cause inflammation. Homogenization can be regarded as an irreversible process to generate microspheres of particular size range while it still remains as the most common approach for microspheres production. Membrane emulsification technology shows great potential in fine tailoring of microspheres while still holds promising ability for scale-up production. Membranes with uniform large pores and dual hydrophilicity might be capable of the production of large microspheres via emulsification with tailorable size distribution. The aim of this study is to verify the feasibility of PVDF membranes with large pores on the generation of PCL microspheres via the combined crystallization diffusion (CCD) approach. The effect of dope solution concentration and PVDF molecular weights on membrane morphologies and the corresponding microspheres characteristics were investigated. Results showed that concentration of 20 wt% produced microspheres at desirable size of 24.14 µm and the optimal span of 0.53. Microspheres with narrow distribution showed the highest drug loading efficiency of baicalin at 8.42 %. The baicalin loaded PCL microspheres presented gradual release of drug release over 33-day of in vitro testing and significantly improved cell growth rate of 111.67 % as compared to the ones prepared by homogenization approach. The wound healing ability was enhanced after the treatment of baicalin-loaded PCL microspheres as compared to empty loaded PCL microspheres.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This in situ study aimed to evaluate the effect of a new toothpaste formulation containing fluoride (F), casein phosphopeptide amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) and sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP) on the remineralization of initial caries lesions. METHODS: This was a blind, crossover study, performed in 5 experimental phases with a duration of 3 days each. At first, the initial surface hardness (SH) and hardness after demineralization (SH1) were determined. Then, volunteers (n = 10) used palatal appliances containing 4 bovine enamel specimens with initial caries lesions. The treatment regimens were: 1) Placebo (No F-TMP-CPP-ACP), 2) 1100 ppm F (1100F), 3) 1100F+3 %TMP (1100F-TMP), 4) 1100F+10 %CPP-ACP (1100F-CPP-ACP) and 5) 1100F-CPP-ACP-TMP. After 3 days, the final surface hardness (post-remineralization) (SH2), percentage of surface hardness recovery (%SHR), integrated recovery of subsurface hardness (ΔIHR), fluoride- (F), calcium- (Ca) and phosphorus- (P) concentration in the enamel were determined. Data were analyzed by ANOVA (one-way, repeated measures) and Student-Newman-Keuls test (p < 0.05). RESULTS: The enamel surface showed greater remineralization (SH2) when treated with 1100F-CPP-ACP-TMP (224.8KHN±1.6) compared to 1100F (163.9KHN±2.0) (p < 0.033). Treatment with 1100F-CPP-ACP-TMP led to remineralization of the subsurface lesion (ΔIHR) by 84 % and 91 % when compared to the 1100F and 1100F-CPP-ACP treatments (p < 0.05). For the F concentration values in the enamel, there was an increase of ⁓ 63 % compared to 1100F (p < 0.05). The Ca concentration in the enamel after 1100F-CPP-ACP-TMP treatment was significantly higher in ⁓ 65 %, ⁓ 28 % and ⁓ 15 % when compared to the 1100F, 1100F-CPP-ACP and 1100F-TMP treatments (p < 0.05). The highest concentration of P was observed for 1100F-ACP-CPP-TMP, which was ⁓ 41 % and ⁓ 17 % higher than the 1100F and 1100F-TMP treatments respectively (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The result of this study demonstrates that the combined use of remineralizing agents (F, CPP-ACP, and TMP) in a single toothpaste formulation (1100F-CPP-ACP-TMP) significantly enhances mineral gain compared to conventional toothpaste, as evidenced by a short-term in situ model. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The findings of our study offer essential insights for future investigations and potential clinical applications, especially for individuals with initial caries lesions.",

      "abstract": "Excessive fluoride exposure has been shown to induce diminished sperm quality and mitochondrial dysfunction. The interaction between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is critical for regulating mitochondrial function in spermatogenic cells. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the molecular events involved in mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) in mice exposed to 25, 50, and 100 mg/L NaF for 60 days, and in GC-2spd treated with 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mM NaF for 24 hours. Mitochondrial stress tests revealed a significant reduction in basal respiration, maximal respiration, and ATP production, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction following fluoride exposure. Results further indicated that fluoride exposure significantly enhanced ER-mitochondria contacts, mitochondrial Ca2+ levels, and the expressions of IP3R1, GRP75, VDAC1, and MCU, while reduced the levels of MFN1, MFN2, VAPB, and PTPIP51, along with an increase in Cytochrome C and Caspase-3. Treatment with the Ru360 and IP3R1 siRNA restored mitochondrial membrane potential, while reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ levels and apoptosis rates, indicating that both MCU and IP3R1 play a role in regulating fluoride-induced the formation of MAMs. Collectively, these findings proved that fluoride promoted Ca2+ transfer through MAMs in spermatocytes via the IP3R1-GRP75-VDAC1-MCU axis, and inhibiting IP3R1/MCU might be a potential therapeutic target in fluorosis.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hundred kids between the ages of 3 and 6 who have at least one carious lesion in their primary teeth participated in a randomized controlled experiment. One of the two groups-the experimental group (n = 50), which got a 38% SDF therapy, or the control group (n = 50), which received a placebo-was randomly allocated to the subjects. Over the course of a year, the carious lesions received biannual applications of the SDF. The main result was the stoppage of caries, ascertained by monitoring the change of an active lesion to an inactive one using standardized digital radiographs and clinical evaluations. RESULTS: Only 35% of the carious lesions in the control group showed evidence of arrest after a year, compared to 87% of lesions in the experimental group (P < 0.001). It was shown that there would be one carious lesion arrested for every 2.5 patients with SDF if the number required to treat (NNT) was 2.5. During the research, no notable side effects were noted. CONCLUSION: The remarkable efficacy of SDF in halting dental caries in primary teeth highlights its significance in the treatment of young dental patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dental caries is a prevalent oral health issue, primarily resulting from demineralization of the enamel. Remineralizing agents such as sodium fluoride (NaF) have been widely used to counteract this process. Recent studies suggest that natural extracts, such as grape seed extract (GSE), may also have significant remineralizing properties. This study aims to compare the efficacy of GSE and NaF on surface and subsurface enamel lesions in an in vitro setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, 60 extracted human premolars were randomly divided into three groups of 20 each: control (no treatment), NaF treatment, and GSE treatment. Artificial enamel lesions were created on the buccal surfaces of all samples. The NaF group was treated with a 5% sodium fluoride solution, while the GSE group received a 6.5% grape seed extract solution. Treatments were applied daily for 10 days. Surface microhardness (SMH) and cross-sectional microhardness (CSMH) were measured before and after treatment to assess remineralization. RESULTS: The NaF group showed a significant increase in SMH (45%) and CSMH (35%) compared to the control group. The GSE group demonstrated a similar trend with a 40% increase in SMH and a 30% increase in CSMH. Both treatments were significantly more effective than the control (P < 0.05), with no significant difference between the NaF and GSE groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Grape seed extract exhibits comparable remineralizing efficacy to sodium fluoride on both surface and subsurface enamel lesions in vitro. These findings suggest that GSE could be a viable natural alternative to fluoride for the prevention and treatment of dental caries."

      "abstract": "Aluminum (Al) coagulation is one of the most widely used techniques for the defluoridation of industrial effluents. This study examined the influence of two common chelating agents, i.e., ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and citric acid (CA), on fluoride removal during coagulation using monomeric Al (AlCl3) and polymeric aluminum species [Al13O4(OH)24(H2O)127+, Al13]. The results revealed that EDTA reduced the fluoride removal efficiency by up to 95.4% with AlCl3 and by 28.3% with Al13. In contrast, CA inhibited fluoride removal by up to 100% with AlCl3 and 90.6% with Al13. Both chelators impaired fluoride removal primarily by disrupting floc formation. Advanced analytical techniques, including 19F/27Al NMR spectroscopy combined with DFT calculations, demonstrated that this interference was due to the formation of EDTA-Al-F ternary complexes and Al-CA binary complexes. Additionally, the formation of a bridging fluoride (μ-F) in the Al13 structure enhanced its thermodynamic stability against chelators. Specifically, Al13 maintained structural stability even in the presence of up to 1.50 mmol/L EDTA, whereas CA progressively destabilized the Al13 structure by forming soluble Al-CA complexes. These findings are believed to help guide the rational design of Al-based coagulants and optimize water treatment strategies aimed at defluoridation of industrial effluents.",

SDF with GIC can be administered together to stop the caries in cavitated lesions. Therefore, it is of interest to assess the shear bond strength of glass ionomer cement (type IX) to demineralized dentin in primary teeth treated with SDF and KI. The occlusal edges of sixty non-carious primary molar teeth were sliced until the yellow dentin was discernible. Each sample was embedded in an acrylic block with its occlusal surface facing upward after being submerged in a demineralizing solution for 7 days. Three groups were created from the samples: Group 1: The untreated group (control group) to which GIC type IX was placed directly; Group 2: Samples received immediate application of GIC type IX after getting treated with silver diamine fluoride (Experimental group) and Group 3: Silver diamine fluoride followed by potassium iodide followed by GIC type IX application (Experimental group). A Universal Testing Machine was subsequently utilized to perform a shear bond test on the specimens. Data shows that previously treated cement with SDF+KI increases the shear bond test without negatively impacted the bond strength GIC to dentin."

      "abstract": "The presence of fluoride ions (F-) in nitrogen-rich wastewater from photovoltaic and semiconductor industries introduces a significant challenge to biological treatment processes, particularly for the innovative partial denitrification (PD) process, which supplies nitrite for anaerobic ammonium oxidation (Anammox). This study provides the first comprehensive and systematic investigation of the effects of F- stress on the granule-based PD process through batch tests and long-term operation. Results indicate that PD activity remains resilient to F- shock up to 1.5 g/L but is markedly impaired at concentrations of 2.0-3.0 g/L, despite maintaining a nitrate-to-nitrite transformation ratio (NTR) of approximately 80 %. Under long-term F- stress at 0.5 g/L, NTR gradually reduces to 50 %, but subsequently recovers to and maintains at 70 %. The increased secretion of loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances and proteins likely enhances the resistance of PD granules to F- stress, though excessive amounts degrade their settling properties. F--induced microbial community succession shapes a predominance of medium granules (1.0 < d < 2.0 mm of 60.2 %) by enhancing aggregation of smaller granules and disintegration of larger ones. This enhances the mechanical strength and microbial activity of PD granules, aiding in resistance to F- stress to sustain microbial metabolism. Thauera is selectively enriched under long-term F- stress, with upregulated nirBDS genes contributing to the reduced NTR. Additionally, increased electron metabolism activity and a robust antioxidative response help to maintain higher microbial metabolic activity, mitigating F--induced oxidative stress. These findings advance our understanding of the resilience and adaptability of the PD process under F- stress, providing critical insights for optimizing biological wastewater treatment systems in challenging environments.",

      "abstract": "Toxicity is associated with undue sodium fluoride (NaF) exposure, and Betaine (BET) is recognised for its nutraceutical benefits. Although it is necessary to reduce toxic level exposure to fluoride, the literature lacks information on the role of BET in mitigating fluoride-induced reproductive toxicity. Therefore, this study assesses the impact of BET on NaF-induced reproductive perturbation in male rats. Wistar rats were treated with NaF (9 mg/kg) alone or co-treated with BET (50 or 100 mg/kg) for 28 d. Our findings indicate that BET significantly mitigated alterations in sperm functionality indices caused by NaF treatment. BET substantially increased reproductive hormone levels and averted NaF-induced increases in oxidative stress biomarkers and testicular enzymes. NaF-induced increases in inflammatory markers in the testis, epididymis, and hypothalamus were effectively reversed upon BET co-treatment. Also, co-treatment with BET protected genome integrity, as evidenced by p53 and apoptotic markers Bax and Bcl-2 levels, abating damages in the testes, epididymis, and hypothalamus of NaF-treated rats. Also, our findings from in-silico studies revealed that BET moderately inhibits the molecular activation of the inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB kinase, hypoxia-inducible factor -1 alpha, and proviral integration for the Moloney murine leukaemia virus-1 kinase. While it is preferable to reduce fluoride exposure, the relevant findings here indicate that BET exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties that ameliorate inadvertent NaF-mediated toxicities in experimental rats exposed to NaF."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The study sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) relative to sodium fluoride (NaF) varnish and direct restorations placed chairside or under general anaesthesia, accounting for caries activity. METHODS: An analytical decision-tree model was developed with clinical data from multiple centres to evaluate the four treatment options among all children aged 1-6 years in Singapore (N = 231,880) over a 12-month time horizon. Base-case scenarios consisted of children with low (1 carious tooth)- and high (7 carious teeth)-caries activity. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and net monetary benefits (NMBs) were tabulated with the outcomes set to be the control of active caries and avoidance of tooth extractions. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Overall, SDF was less effective than direct restorations placed chairside but was less costly. For children with low-caries activity, the ICER for SDF was SGD 9 per caries-controlled tooth and SGD 68 per extraction avoided. For children with high-caries activity, the ICERs were SGD 267 and SGD 1,909, respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of SGD 30, the NMB was negative (favours restorations) for caries control in children with low-caries activity and positive (favours SDF) for all other situations. In the low-caries activity group, SDF had a 41.5% probability of being cost-effective for caries control and 49.2% probability of being cost-effective for the avoidance of extraction. The corresponding probabilities for the high-caries activity group were 99.8% and 100%. The NMB of SDF increases proportionally with caries activity, suggesting utilization of SDF should depend on caries activity. Results were most sensitive to changes in relative cost and effectiveness of SDF/direct restorations. CONCLUSION: SDF was cost-effective in most situations except for caries control in children with low-caries activity. Direct restorations were more effective and should be considered in low-caries activity children."

      "abstract": "The present study focuses on creating a novel functionalized adsorbent AC-Al-Mg-La for the extraction of fluoride ions from wastewater. The characterizations of the adsorbent were analyzed before and after modification by employing the techniques such as FTIR, XRD, SEMand zeta potential. The suggested adsorbent materials were evaluated for their effectiveness in treating fluoridated water. The impacts of the adsorbent dosage, initial pollutant level, water pH, and regeneration efficiency were assessed. Fluoride ion adsorption was highest at the optimal conditions of pH 4.0 ± 0.1; 30 min contact time, and a 0.15 g/L adsorbent dose. However, adsorption efficiency decreased at higher pH levels.At pH 4.0 ± 0.1, the peak adsorption efficiencies observed after 30 min of contact time with 0.15 g/L of the adsorbent dose were 72% for AC-La, 81% for AC-Al, 89% for AC-Mg, and 96% for AC-Al-Mg-La. The analysis of the AC-Al-Mg-La material's regeneration capabilities showed that, even after five consecutive cycles of adsorption and regeneration, it maintained decontamination potential of 71% after first cycle and reduced to 41% after fifth regeneration, representing a 30% reduction in effectiveness. This paper intends to encourage novel ideas and advancements in the creation of the next generation of eco-friendly adsorbent for defluorination.",

The present study aims to elucidate the influence of two different sintering methods on fluoride-substituted apatite properties. Methods: For this purpose, a two F-substituted apatites were produced by heat treatment in different ways called \"rapid sintering\" and \"slow sintering\". Physicochemical properties of the obtained materials were analyzed using infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, and mercury intrusion porosimetry. Cytotoxicity of materials was assessed using MTT test. Results: Sintering conditions significantly influenced some porosity parameters of the materials. The samples subjected to \"rapid sintering\" showed a larger total pore area and mercury intrusion volume, while the samples subjected to \"slow sintering\" showed higher average pore diameter. Other porosity parameters did not differ significantly between the tested materials. The crystalline phases and chemical compositions of both materials were the same. Both materials appeared to be non-toxic since their extracts did not caused reduction in the viability of MC3T3-E1 cells compared to control cells and the results obtained were similar for both materials. Conclusions: Sintering is an important step in the apatite synthesis process. The way apatite is sintered is a factor that influences its physicochemical properties. The study performed on fluoride-substituted apatite showed that sintering conditions influenced some porosity parameters but had no effect on composition, chemical structure or crystalline phase. The cytotoxicity of both materials was at the same level, indicating that both were non-toxic.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the enamel remineralization effect of fluoride-incorporated bioactive glass (F-BG) toothpaste on artificial subsurface caries in primary teeth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty sound primary maxillary incisors were subjected to a demineralizing solution for four days to induce artificial enamel caries. The teeth were randomly divided into four experimental groups (n = 10 per group): Group I, F-BG toothpaste (530 ppm fluoride) (BiominF®); Group II, 0.22% sodium fluoride toothpaste (1000 ppm fluoride) (Colgate®); Group III, 0.32% sodium fluoride toothpaste (1450 ppm fluoride) (Colgate®); and Group IV, deionized water as a control. Over the course of seven days, each specimen was treated with a slurry of the respective toothpaste twice daily, followed by pH cycling to simulate oral conditions. Mineral density (MD) values were measured at depths of 0, 40, 80, and 120 μm using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) before and after the pH cycling. The percentage of remineralization was calculated based on changes in MD. Statistical comparisons among the groups were made using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by post-hoc Bonferroni tests, with a significance level set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: At depths of 0, 40, and 80 μm, both F-BG toothpaste (Group I) and the 1450 ppm fluoride toothpaste (Group III) demonstrated significantly higher remineralization than the 1000 ppm fluoride toothpaste (Group II) and the control group (Group IV) (P < 0.05). No significant difference in remineralization was observed between Group I and Group III (P > 0.05). At a depth of 120 μm, none of the test groups showed significant remineralization compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The fluoride-incorporated bioactive glass toothpaste (530 ppm fluoride) demonstrated remineralization effects on enamel comparable to those of the 1450 ppm fluoride toothpaste in terms of both surface and subsurface enamel restoration in primary teeth. Clinically, this suggests that F-BG toothpaste may be a viable alternative for remineralization therapy in pediatric populations, especially in situations where lower fluoride concentrations are preferred for young children. Further long-term studies are needed to assess the clinical durability and efficacy of F-BG toothpaste in caries prevention and management."

The assessment considered the different phases in the wood chips' production, with special emphasis on the SF treatment. In addition to B. xylophilus and its vectors Monochamus spp., 22 EU quarantine pests and protected zone quarantine pests, some of which are regulated as groups of pests by the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072, are present in the US and are potentially associated with the commodity. For these pests an expert judgement is given on the likelihood of pest freedom taking into consideration the available scientific information and technical information provided by the US, including uncertainties associated with the assessment. The likelihood of pest freedom varies among the pests evaluated, with B. xylophilus being the pest most frequently expected on the commodity. The Expert Knowledge Elicitation (EKE) indicated with 95% certainty that between 9491 and 10,000 m3 of debarked conifer wood chips treated with SF per 10,000 m3 will be free from B. xylophilus, and that between 9987 and 10,000 m3 of wood chips per 10,000 m3 will be free from Monochamus spp. Technical elements which are critical for a successful treatment and for minimising the presence of Union quarantine pests on the commodity are identified and described in the opinion. In particular, it is important to note that SF treatments are generally less effective in eliminating fungi than insects, the required parameters of the fumigation should be met at all points of the pile of wood chips and the time of storage of wood chips before treatment should be kept as short as possible because B. xylophilus can easily reproduce and spread throughout the pile under conducive conditions."

However, efficient fabrication of conductive membranes poses challenges. An in situ oxidative polymerization approach was applied to prepare PVDF-based conductive membranes (PVDF-CMs) and response surface methodology (RSM) was adopted to optimize modification conditions enhancing membrane performance. The anti-fouling property of the conductive membranes was analyzed using model pollutants. The results indicate that when the concentrations of the pyrrole, BVIMBF4, and FeCl3·6H2O are 0.9 mol/L, 4.8 mmol, and 0.8 mol/L, respectively, the electrical resistance of the PVDF-CM is 93 Ω/sq with the water contact angle of 31°, demonstrating good conductivity and hydrophilicity. Batch membrane filtration experiments coupled with negative voltage indicated that when an external voltage of 2.0 V is applied, membrane fouling rates for the conductive membrane filtering BSA and SA solutions are reduced by 17.7% and 17.2%, respectively, compared to the control (0 V). When an external voltage of 0.5 V is applied, the membrane fouling rate for the conductive membrane filtering HA solution is reduced by 72.6%. This study provides a valuable reference for the efficient preparation of conductive membranes for cost-effective wastewater treatment."

The aim of this study is to determine the level of knowledge and the attitude of Spanish dentists (GDPs) and final-year dental students (DSs) regarding the use of SDF. Methods: A cross-sectional survey (questionnaire) was carried out aimed at final-year dental students (DSs) (n = 43) and registered dentists (GDPs) (n = 1050) in the autonomous community of the region of Murcia (Spain). Results: the response rates were GDPs 7.7% (n = 81) and DSs 84.5% (n = 38). Only 20.98% of GDP respondents reported having been trained on SDF versus 100% of DSs. Significant differences were observed between the groups (p < 0.05). While 94.7% of the students were aware of the indications for the use of SDF, only 56.8% of the general dentists reported it. Similarly, for hypersensitivity treatment, 71.1% of the students were informed versus 40.7% of the general dentists, and indications for paediatric patients, 100% for the DS group and 59.3% in GDPs. In adult patients, indications vary from GDPs' (50%) to DSs' (25.9%) responses. About 94.7% of DSs know the advantages of use and only 50.6% of GDPs. Both groups showed reluctance to use SDF in esthetic zones, with greater acceptance in non-esthetic areas (p < 0.05). In practice, fewer GDPs (27.16%) and DSs (23.68%) had applied SDF, reflecting a gap between knowledge and implementation. Conclusions: Dental students had a significantly higher level of knowledge, a situation that evidences the high level of education and training in the curricular guides of the universities."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare remineralisation efficacy between silver diamine fluoride (SDF) combined with potassium iodide (KI) and sodium fluoride (NaF) varnish using hydroxyapatite (HAP) artificial white spot lesions (AWSLs) demineralisation model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 25 HAP disks was randomly divided into five groups (n = 5): baseline, AWSLs, deionized water (DW), SDF-KI or F-varnish. After AWSLs were developed, the specimen was treated with either deionized water, SDF-KI or F-varnish. These specimens were then subjected to pH-cycling for 7 days. The remineralisation potential was assessed by measuring changes in Vickers hardness (VHN). Morphological and compositional analyses were conducted using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray (EDX), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Ion-selective electrodes (ISE) were utilised to measure calcium and fluoride release. RESULTS: SDF-KI treatment demonstrated statistically significant remineralisation potential in restoring VHN values vs baseline levels (p 0.001). SEM, EDX, and XRD analyses confirmed the mineral deposits to indicate remineralisation. The uptake of calcium was higher in SDF-KI than in F-varnish (p = 0.011). The fluorapatite (FAP) and fluoride-substituted apatite formation were validated by FTIR and XRD analyses. CONCLUSION: SDF-KI and F-varnish applications are both effective in promoting remineralisation on HAP disks. The application of SDF-KI affected the physicochemical and mechanical properties of demineralised HAP. The SDF-KI showed more formation of fluoride-substituted apatite and is effective in the hardening of demineralised HAP.",

To explore whether fluoride disrupts lysosomal biosynthesis via the GSK3β signaling, leading to neurological damage, both in vivo rat models and in vitro PC12 cell models were conducted. Subsequent findings revealed reduced spatial learning and memory abilities, decreased hippocampal neurons, and disrupted neuronal arrangement in NaF-treated rats. In vitro, PC12 cells exhibited decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis rates after NaF treatment for 24 h. Moreover, immunofluorescence assays demonstrated that there is a reduction in the number of mature lysosomes and an increase in immature lysosomes in NaF-treated PC12 cells, evident by decreased co-localization of LAMP1 with Arl8b, and increased co-localization of LAMP1 with Rab7. Furthermore, both in vivo and in vitro, the protein expression of cleaved caspase-3 was upregulated, whereas the protein expressions of TFEB and CTSB were downregulated. The GSK3β signaling activation was detected, and this was confirmed by silencing GSK3β with siRNA in vitro. Collectively, these results indicate that NaF can impair lysosomal biosynthesis via GSK3β signaling, promoting neuronal apoptosis, and consequently impairing neurological function in rats.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of 38% silver diamine fluoride (SDF) with different application frequencies in arresting dentine caries of permanent teeth in people with intellectual disabilities (ID) and evaluated their treatment cooperation. METHODS: Forty-six people with ID (aged 6-30 years) with at least one permanent dentine caries were assigned to two groups: Group 1 (N = 23, 51 teeth) received semiannual applications, while Group 2 (N = 23, 61 teeth) received once a week for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by one application semiannually. Caries activity and Frankl behaviour rating scales were assessed at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Chi-squared, Fisher's exact, and multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: At 6 months, the between-group difference in caries-arresting rate was not statistically significant (14.0%, 95% CI: -0.7%, 28.7%). At 12 months, unadjusted analysis showed significantly higher caries-arresting rates in Group 2 compared to Group 1 (difference: 18.9%, 95% CI: 2.5%,35.3%). However, multilevel logistic regression revealed no significant differences between groups at both time points. No subjects showed behaviour deterioration; behaviour improvement was observed in 37.5% of Group 1 and 57.1% of Group 2 at 12 months. CONCLUSION: Overall, 38% SDF is effective in arresting dentine caries in people with ID without a significant difference in application frequency. Applying 38% SDF does not negatively impact behaviour in people with ID and may promote positive behavioural changes.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the education, knowledge and behaviour of Italian dentists regarding Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to December 2022, through an online survey linked to an online continuing medical education (CME) course sent to Italian dentists. A priori power analysis estimated the necessary sample to be 1480 dentists with an anticipated frequency of 50% and a power of 99.99%. The questionnaire included 46 questions on participants ' demographic characteristics, training received, clinical knowledge of SDF, and attitudes and behaviours regarding its use. Descriptive statistics, bivariate, and mutlivariable regression analyses were performed to determine the association between the variables. RESULTS: The response rate was 6.1% with 3876 respondents, evenly distributed geographically. Less than 10% of respondents had received training at undergraduate, postgraduate or masters level. A minority of dentists were familiar with the use of SDF for the treatment of dentine hypersensitivity (19.0%) and for the treatment of caries in children (22.2%) and adults (15.7%). The percentage of dentists who reported SDF use at least once was 20.6%. On mutlivariable analysis (χ2(11) = 995.9 p-value < 0.01), dentists who used SDF were positively associated with those who cared for patients with special needs, those who received good undergraduate or postgraduate training, and those who knew how to use SDF (p < 0.01). A second mutlivariable analysis (χ2(11) = 47.9 p-value < 0.01) revealed that younger respondents were associated with good training and knowledge of the use of SDF received during undergraduate studies, while older respondents were associated with good training received on managing hypersensitivity and caries in adults (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, Italian dentists ' education, knowledge, and use of SDF were relatively poor. The majority of the sample 's responses were not consistent with scientific evidence. The use of SDF among Italian dentists is still far from being a reality. In Italy, it is necessary to increase training on SDF, primarily through the university, to hopefully increase its use, especially in non-invasive caries treatment.",

NaF (100 ppm, orally) dosing via drinking water was given to pregnant rats in disease group. In the treatment groups, Metformin & Dehydrozingerone (DHZ) (200 mg/kg) were administered orally along with NaF, and the dosing was continued throughout the gestation and lactation periods to the pups until the end of experiment. Behavioural studies like Novel Object Recognition Test (NORT), Open Field & Actophotometer test and biochemical estimations like Acetylcholinesterase (AchE), Glutathione (GSH), Malondialdehyde (MDA) were conducted on animals followed by histopathological image analysis. It was observed that NaF exposure significantly decreased learning, memory and locomotor ability (at p < 0.05, p ≤ 0.01) in rat pups and was also able to induce anxiety like behavior. Levels of AchE (p ≤ 0.001) and MDA (p ≤ 0.01, p ≤ 0.001) was found to be significantly elevated and GSH levels were significantly decreased (p ≤ 0.01, p ≤ 0.001) in hippocampus and frontal cortex in the disease group. Histopathological image analysis showed presence of degenerated neurons in hippocampus of disease group. From this study, it was observed that treatment with Metformin and DHZ, was able to significantly ameliorate the cognitive impairments, improve the condition of oxidative stress and decrease neuronal degeneration in NaF fed rat pups. These results established the protective role of Metformin and DHZ in NaF induced neurodevelopmental toxicity with particular emphasis on their antioxidant properties."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Utilizing 38% silver diamine fluoride (SDF) has been demonstrated in clinical trials to prevent and halt early childhood caries (ECC). Based on a research evaluation, it has been found that 38% SDF can effectively prevent new tooth decay and stop existing tooth decay in children's primary teeth. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the survival of teeth treated with repeated applications of 38% SDF in children with ECC and to compare the outcomes between single and multiple applications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A split-mouth, double-blind, active-control, parallel-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted following Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. Children aged 4-5 years with bilateral ECC were recruited from a primary government school in Maharashtra, India. Treatment involved applying 38% SDF to carious lesions, with lesions randomized into two groups: single application and double application. Follow-ups were conducted at 6 and 12 months to assess lesion progression, depth, and survival. RESULTS: Eighty-four primary carious teeth from 42 female participants were included. Lesions were predominantly occlusal or proximal, with varying sizes and depths. After 12 months, 12 lesions failed in group I (single application) and 3 in group II (double application). The intergroup comparison of mean levels at 12 months showed a statistically significant difference (p = 0.01). Intragroup comparisons showed an increase in lesion depth and level from baseline to 6 months, with a subsequent rise from 6 to 12 months in group I. The mean survival rate of teeth after SDF application at the end of 12 months was around 94% for group II, while for group I it further decreased from 70 to 58%. CONCLUSION: Repeated applications of 38% SDF showed improved survival rates of teeth in children with ECC compared to single applications. Double application of SDF demonstrated superior efficacy in maintaining tooth survival over 12 months. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Kharat PB, Rajpurohit L, Mathur A, et al.

The optimization of the flocculant was also investigated, including La/Si molar ratio, pH, agitation time, dosage and sedimentation time. Results showed that PSFCL has reached an excellent removal efficiency of 95% and 97% towards phosphorus and fluoride, respectively. It could be inferred that charge neutralization, bridging effect and ligand exchange were the main coagulation mechanisms. As a whole, after the introduction of lanthanum, PSFCL was found to be a promising flocculant in yellow phosphorus wastewater treatment owing to its high removal efficiency and simple synthesis route."

The adsorbent material was characterised using FTIR, XRF, XRD, SEM, Raman Spectroscopy, and BET surface area analysis. The synthesised EG defluorinated wastewater, utilising response surface methodology (RSM) for experimental design and optimisation. XRD patterns confirmed the successful synthesis of graphite and EG, demonstrating structural modifications. Raman spectra indicated higher crystalline order in EG, with D and G band shifts and an increased ID/IG intensity ratio from 0.89-1.04. BET analysis revealed a specific surface area of 247.1 m²/g. . FTIR analysis showed abundant functional groups, particularly hydroxyl (-OH) and alkene (C = C). Batch adsorption experiments revealed that fluoride adsorption onto EG depended on pH, time, and initial fluoride concentration. Optimal conditions for fluoride removal, determined using RSM with central composite design (CCD), demonstrated a maximum fluoride removal rate of 97%. Isotherm data fitted both Langmuir and Freundlich model, and kinetics data aligned well with the pseudo-first-order model. ANOVA showed significant effects of contact time, pH, adsorbent dose, and initial fluoride concentration on removal efficiency. The model's R² value of 0.98 and lack of fit value of 0.1554 confirmed the quality of the second-order polynomial model. Optimal conditions for maximum fluoride removal efficiency of 97% were validated at 5 mg/L fluoride concentration, pH 4, adsorbent dose of 5 g/L, and a contact time of 30 min. Therefore, the present study demonstrated efficient fluoride-polluted water treatment using waste-derived EG."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Excessive fluoride exposure leads to increased oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, causing harmful effects on the metabolic organs in the human body. Betanin, a pigment obtained from beetroot, is seen to have powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. The study was conducted to determine the role of betanin in fluoride induced hepato-renal toxicity in Wistar rats. METHODS: Twenty four rats were divided into four groups. Group Ⅰ (control) rats received 1 mL distilled water; group Ⅱ rats were administered 10 mg/kg of sodium fluoride (NaF); group Ⅲ received 10 mg/kg NaF and 50 mg/kg (low dose) betanin; group Ⅳ received 10 mg/kg NaF and 200 mg/kg (high dose) betanin. Animals were dosed orally for 90 days. Various markers of liver and kidney function as well as oxidative stress were measured. Liver and kidney samples were examined for histopathology. RESULTS: Animals in group Ⅱ had significantly increased levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen compared to the NaF + betanin treated animals (group Ⅲ & Ⅳ). Malondialdehyde, nitric oxide levels were significantly lower in rats treated with NaF + betanin (low and high dose). Histologically, in group II rats, signs of interstitial nephritis were seen in the kidneys while liver sections showed clear indication of features of fatty liver and inflammatory cell infiltration. Treatment with betanin alleviated the severity of histopathological changes induced by NaF. CONCLUSIONS: Betanin significantly ameliorated NaF-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, therefore, has potential to be used as protective agent against fluoride induced hepato-renal toxicity.",

Methods: Children younger than 72 months of age with active dentinal caries lesions (ICDAS 5 or 6) in primary teeth received two applications of 38 percent SDF and five percent NaFV as part of an RCT testing three different frequency regimes (one, four, and six months apart). The Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS) questionnaire was completed at three study visits. Statistical analyses included descrip- tive and parametric methods. A P -value of ≤0.05 was significant. Results: Eighty-two children (58.5 percent male) were recruited with a mean age of 44.3±14.2 months. Significant improvement in total ECOHIS scores for all children was observed following treatment (baseline mean scores=4.52±4.77 versus third visit mean scores=3.19±3.78, P =0.01) and family impact scores for all children (base- line mean scores=3.00±2.98 versus third visit mean scores=1.68±2.01, P ≤0.001). However, no significant change in the mean child impact score was observed among all the children ( P =0.97). The parental distress and family function domains showed the most improvement with SDF treatment. No significant ECOHIS score differences were found among the three frequency groups across visits. Conclusions: Children showed better OHRQoL after applying 38 percent SDF and five percent NaFV. No significant differences were found between treatment groups. SDF is a viable non-restorative option for managing ECC as it has a positive effect on OHRQoL.",

The purpose of the present study was to explore the dental professionals' perceptions of using SDF and to understand the barriers and enabling factors to using SDF with and without light-curing. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted with dental professionals who had experience with using SDF with and without light-curing. A purposive heterogeneous and convenience sampling approach was applied to ensure the inclusion of participants with different employment and experience levels. Eighteen participants (dental students (undergraduate and postgraduate), dental personnel (practicing dentists and dental hygienists), and academics) with ages ranging from 22 to 53 years old participated in the study. The data were collected through a semi-structured open-ended questionnaire. Manual line-by-line coding and content analysis methods were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Most participants indicated a preference for light-curing, citing perceived benefits, such as quicker treatment, convenience, better visibility, prevention of saliva contamination, and ensuring thorough SDF coverage. However, some participants voiced concerns, based either on existing practice guidelines or due to insufficient evidence regarding the efficacy of light-curing. Additionally, one participant proposed a hybrid approach based on tooth location, suggesting avoiding using light-curing on anterior teeth, while utilizing it on posterior teeth. CONCLUSION: The participants' responses indicated that the use of SDF with and without light-curing each has its merits. Using SDF with light-curing emerged as the preferred method due to perceived benefits. e.g., quicker treatment, better moisture control. However, concerns regarding existing guidelines and the lack of robust evidence for its efficacy were also identified. This study highlights the need for additional research to address the knowledge gaps and provide stronger evidence to support the use of light-curing after SDF application.",

      "abstract": "X-ray-induced photodynamic therapy (X-PDT) represents a promising new method of cancer treatment. A novel type of nanoscintillator based on cerium fluoride (CeF3) nanoparticles (NPs) modified with flavin mononucleotide (FMN) has been proposed. A method for synthesizing CeF3-FMN NPs has been developed, enabling the production of colloidal, spherical NPs with an approximate diameter of 100 nm, low polydispersity, and a high fluorescence quantum yield of 0.42. It has been demonstrated that CeF3-FMN NPs exhibit pH-dependent radiation-induced redox activity when exposed to X-rays. This activity results in the generation of reactive oxygen species, which is associated with the scintillation properties of cerium and the transfer of electrons to FMN. The synthesized NPs have been demonstrated to exhibit minimal cytotoxicity towards normal cells (NCTC L929 fibroblasts) but are more toxic to tumor cells (epidermoid carcinoma A431). Concurrently, the synthesized NPs (CeF3 and CeF3-FMN NPs) demonstrate a pronounced selective radiosensitizing effect on tumor cells at concentrations of 10-7 and 10-3 M, resulting in a significant reduction in their clonogenic activity, increasing radiosensitivity for cancer cells by 1.9 times following X-ray irradiation at a dose of 3 to 6 Gy. In the context of normal cells, these nanoparticles serve the function of antioxidants, maintaining a high level of clonogenic activity. Functional nanoscintillators on the basis of cerium fluoride can be used as part of the latest technologies for the treatment of tumors within the framework of X-PDT."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Daily-use fluoride products are first-line protection against enamel wear from dietary-acid exposure (DAE). This study aimed to understand effects of fluoride concentration, fluoride salt, product form and ingredients in daily-use products on remineralisation and demineralisation, via network meta-analysis (NMA) of 14 studies using one well-established in-situ model. Remineralisation (surface-microhardness recovery, SHMR) after treatment, and protection against subsequent demineralisation (acid-resistance ratio, ARR) were measured. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy participants, wearing intra-oral palatal appliances holding enamel specimens eroded with standardised DAE, used test products once. Enamel hardness was assessed (Knoop microhardness probe) pre-DAE; post-DAE; after 4 h intra-oral remineralisation; and after post-remineralisation DAE. NMA was performed using a mixed-models approach on subject-level data to estimate and compare means. RESULTS: There was a dose-response for fluoride ion in toothpastes (0-1426ppm F; p < 0.001 for SMHR and ARR). One toothpaste (silica-based, 1150ppm F as NaF) showed a benefit for SMHR versus placebo [mean(standard error)]: 8.8%(0.6%) (33.0% vs. 24.2%; p < 0.001); for ARR: 0.27(0.03) (0.43 vs. 0.15; p < 0.001; 9 mutual studies). Use of fluoride mouthwash after fluoride toothpaste increased SMHR [2.4%(1.1%); p = 0.043; 3 studies]; the effect on ARR [0.08(0.05)] was not significant (p = 0.164). Negative effects of polyvalent metal ions and polyphosphates on SMHR (p < 0.05) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: NMA proved effective in discriminating between fluoride-based treatments in this in-situ study, highlighting the importance of fluoride ion to enamel protection and showing formulation ingredients can affect its performance. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Daily-use fluoride products can protect enamel against dietary acids, but careful formulation is required for optimal performance.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of dental caries is high in Japan, leading to a huge burden of overall expenditure on dental caries treatment for the population. School-based fluoride mouth-rinse (S-FMR) has been implemented as a public health intervention. However, its cost-effectiveness remains unclear, where universal health insurance covers a broad range of dental treatments at relatively low cost. The aim of the study was to determine whether S-FMR is associated with lower dental caries treatment expenditure in Japan, where the universal health insurance system widely covers dental treatments. In addition, the cost-benefit of S-FMR was estimated. METHODS: This ecological study examined the association between S-FMR coverage and dental caries treatment expenditure in all 47 prefectures of Japan. Data were obtained from the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan open data (NDB Open Data Japan), national survey data on the prevalence of S-FMR, and other census data for each prefecture. The outcome variable was the average annual treatment expenditure of for children aged 5-14 per child. The explanatory variable was the S-FMR coverage of children per prefecture, divided into quartiles: (Q1) 0.0%-0.48%, (Q2) 0.54%-6.9%, (Q3) 7.2%-25.0% and (Q4) 26.9%-80.4%. Linear regression analysis was performed with adjustment for the number of dental clinics per 100 000 individuals, per capita prefectural income, and percentage of the population aged between 5 and 14 years. RESULTS: The dental caries treatment expenditure was lower in prefectures with higher S-FMR coverage: (Q1) 2378 JPY, (Q2) 2215 JPY, (Q3) 2217 JPY and (Q4) 2065 JPY. Linear regression analysis showed that, compared to the prefectures with the lowest S-FMR coverage, the prefectures with the highest coverage exhibited significantly lower per person dental caries treatment expenditure by 186.0 (95% CI = 96.6, 275.4) JPY. When annual cost of S-FMR per person was lower, 200 JPY, S-FMR would save 0.9 billion JPY if all prefectures change from Q1 to Q4 (approximately 8.2 million USD). CONCLUSIONS: Although public healthcare insurance in Japan covers most dental treatments at a relatively low cost, the current findings suggest that S-FMR could still be a cost-effective public health intervention.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Saliva contains a variety of biochemical compounds, including antioxidants, and serves as the body's first line of defense against oxidative stress caused by free radicals. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dental treatments on salivary oxidative stress biomarkers in children aged 3-5 years with severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) compared to children without caries. METHOD: This study was conducted on 20 children aged 3-5 years with severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) and 20 children without caries. Salivary oxidative stress biomarkers and antioxidants were measured after the initial examination (T0), after the end of restorative treatments (T1), and after fluoride varnish applications (T2). Post hoc Bonferroni test was used to compare normally distributed parameters between T0-T1-T2 times. Pearson correlation analysis was used to examine the relationships between parameters that conform to normal distribution. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the parameters in the control and experimental groups. Significance was evaluated at the p < 0.05 level. RESULTS: The mean dmft of the participants in the study group was 8.86 ± 14.5. Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), dityrosine (DT), kynurenine (KYN), advanced glycation end products (AGE), lipid hydroperoxides (LHP) and malondialdehyde (MDA) values decrease after the treatment of dental caries and protective fluoride varnish applications, while an increases in total thiol (TSH) and Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) values were observed after protective varnish applications compared to pre-treatment values. Antioxidant parameters at time T2 in the study group were statistically significantly higher than in the control group (p < 0.05). In the study group, there was no correlation between TSH and oxidative stress mediators in terms of changes at time T1 post-treatment compared to the pre-treatment period, while an inverse moderate relationship was found with AGE and LHP in terms of changes at time T2 post-treatment (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: An increase in salivary antioxidants was detected after dental restorations were completed and protective fluoride varnish application, while a decrease in oxidative stress markers was detected. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Fluoride varnish applications applied in the study group may further reduce the oral microbiome load and cause salivary oxidative stress markers to be significantly lower than in the control group.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial effects of CTF against common microbes associated with dental caries and periodontal disease. METHOD: The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentrations (MBC/MFC) were used to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of CTF against eight common bacteria and one fungus associated with dental caries and periodontal disease. These nine microbes included cariogenic pathogens (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus casei, Actinomyces naeslundii and Candida albicans), pulpitis-related bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis) and periodontal disease-related bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to examine the morphological changes of microbes with and without CTF treatment. RESULTS: The MIC of CTF against nine microbes ranged from 80 ppm (Lacticaseibacillus casei) to 640 ppm (Candida albicans and Enterococcus faecalis). The MBC/MFC ranged from 320 ppm (Lacticaseibacillus casei) to 2560 ppm (Candida albicans). TEM revealed abnormal curvature of cell membranes, disrupted cell membranes, cytoplasmic clear zone, and cytoplasmic content leakage of the microbes treated with CTF. CONCLUSION: CTF has antimicrobial effects against common oral pathogens and presents a promising antimicrobial agent to aid management of dental caries and periodontal disease.",

DESIGN: This cross-sectional analytical study was conducted in 2021 among 100 parents. The maximum WTP were collected using payment cards, an originally developed validated and reliable questionnaire, educational videos, and a hypothetical scenario. The data were analyzed using ANOVA, t-test, Pearson correlation coefficient, and linear regression tests (α = 0.05). RESULTS: The mean (±SD) WTP was 245 700 (±158 756.24) and 232380.0 (±166 561.71) IR Tomans for FS and FV, respectively. WTP was significantly higher among parents who visited private clinics (p < 0.05) and government employees. Both in the whole sample and in the public group, parents without supplemental insurance had lower WTP values. The WTP values elicited through the payment card method (p = 0.014) and the open-ended question (p = 0.031) for fathers with educational attainment below a high school diploma were significantly lower. There was no significant difference between the WTP values for these two therapies. Income level of the parents was the main indicator in the regression models, especially for WTP values of FS. CONCLUSIONS: The demographic and socioeconomic conditions of parents as well as their insurance status were associated with the WTP values."

To identify dysregulated genes associated with ferroptosis, we conducted an intersection analysis between differentially expressed genes in fluoride-treated HOS cells (GSE70719) and ferroptosis-related genes from the FerrDb database. A rat model of fluoride-induced spinal cord injury was established, revealing evidence of aberrant molecular and structural changes. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that Tanshinone IIA restored the altered expression of nine ferroptosis-related genes, eight fluorosis-related inflammatory indicators, and the observed structural changes.

This study represents the first investigation into the influence of fluoride on mechanisms related to the invasiveness of human glioblastoma cells. We examined the effects of sodium fluoride (NaF) exposure on the migratory and invasive abilities of the U-87 human glioblastoma cell line, assessing levels of metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 secreted by these cells. Additionally, the activation of metabolic pathways associated with invasiveness, including AKT and NF-κB, was analyzed.

      "abstract": "High fluoride (F) concentrations negatively affect the seed germination, plant growth, development, and yield of crops. Phaseolus vulgaris L. is an F-sensitive crop frequently grown on marginal lands affected by F salts. Selenium (Se) is a vital elicitor of the antioxidative enzymes involved in scavenging free radicals to alleviate abiotic stress. Recent studies have demonstrated that engineered nanoparticles (NPs) have the potential to induce tolerance to abiotic stress in plants. Phytosynthesis of NPs is a novel and sustainable approach to mitigate abiotic stresses. The present study was intended to assess the role of green synthesized Se-nanoparticles (Se-NPs) in improving the physiochemical attributes, growth, and F stress tolerance of P. vulgaris growing in 200 ppm sodium fluoride (NaF) stress. NaF toxicity reduced Chl a, Chl b, and carotenoid content by 88.8%, 95.5%, and 96% compared to control with maximum improvement obtained through phyto-nano seed priming and foliar spray of 70 ppm Se-NPs. The joint treatment of NPs application through seed priming and foliar spray improved stomatal conductance (14.2%) and transpiration rate (11.7%) in plants subjected to NaF stress. The protein content (91.02%) and DPPH activity (33.72%) decreased under NaF stress, which was improved by phyto-nano seed priming and foliar spray (14.10%). Furthermore, the integrated application of Se-NPs seed priming and foliar spray increased nutritional content (P, K, Ca, Mg, and Zn), proline, ascorbic acid, and phenol yet reduced the level of NaF in plants. Se-NPs at 70 ppm were found to be more effective than 60 ppm in all modes of applications. Our results reveal a perception that Se-NPs increase P. vulgaris growth in NaF stress conditions, perhaps through a multipronged approach: improving photosynthetic content, nutrient uptake, and yield of P. vulgaris. Consequently, the findings of this study may be used for breeding and screening F-tolerant cultivars.",

However, the dark staining associated with SDF treatment remains a major concern that affects parental acceptance. This study examines the level of parental acceptance of SDF treatment for preschool children in Laos and explores associated factors such as parental anxiety, previous dental experience, and demographic data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 324 parents of children aged 2-5 years enrolled in preschools in Vientiane Capital, Laos. Participants provided demographic information, details on their children's dental history, and their own dental anxiety levels. Following a video demonstration of the effectiveness and application of SDF, parents completed a survey assessing their acceptance of and concerns about SDF using a 5-point Likert scale. Parental dental anxiety was measured with the modified dental anxiety scale. Data were analyzed using chi-square tests, independent t tests, and multiple logistic regression (P ≤ 0.05). RESULTS: Eighty percent of the parents accepted SDF treatment for their children. Those highly concerned about SDF staining were significantly less likely to accept it as a treatment option (P < 0.01). Increased acceptance correlated with reduced concern about staining (95% confidence interval = 15.57-1095.88). Additionally, 84.9% of parents reported some level of dental anxiety, with older parents showing higher acceptance of SDF. CONCLUSIONS: Parents were highly receptive of the SDF treatment for their children's primary dentition. Parents who were older tended to be less concerned about the staining, and those who had a high level of dental anxiety were more likely to accept SDF treatment."

      "abstract": "The existing technologies in municipal wastewater treatment plants are ineffective in eliminating persistent fluorine-containing contaminants. At the same time, there is an increasing demand for novel organofluorine compounds, particularly in the production of lithium-ion batteries, as well as in the agrochemical and pharmaceutical sectors for more efficient ingredients. This implies that we must account for ongoing changes in the fluorine levels within riverine environments. To determine the fluorine concentration in the water phase of rivers, it is essential to measure both inorganic fluoride and total organofluorine concentrations. These analytes were measured in water samples collected monthly from twelve locations along the Hungarian section of the Danube River during the period from July to December 2023, applying ion-chromatography and combustion ion-chromatography. The concentration of inorganic fluoride ranged from 28 to 76 µg/L, with a median of 45.3 µg/L. The total adsorbable organofluorine concentrations were between 0.22 and 12.5 µg/L, with a median of 2.43 µg/L. To assess the impact of restrictions on the use of PFOA and PFOS compounds, these substances were quantified using a UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS system. A comparison of our data with previously published concentrations in the Danube River reveals a decreasing tendency, justifying the restricted use of these chemicals."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dental caries is a significant global health concern, impacting around 2.5 billion people worldwide. Conventional methods for managing dental caries have evolved to prioritize preventive measures and minimally invasive treatment alternatives. One of these approaches involves the application of silver diamine fluoride. Although effective, the limited use of SDF is attributed to concerns about potential long-term complications and other adverse effects. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to assess the role of SDF in preventing and managing dental caries, evaluating its efficacy and adverse reactions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This review adheres to PRISMA guidelines. An electronic search was performed on PubMed, Google Scholar, and CENTRAL to include peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials published between 2014 and 2024. The Cochrane risk of bias and GRADE tools were employed to evaluate the trials and ensure the certainty of the evidence. Statistical analysis was conducted to examine the effectiveness of SDF at the individual, tooth, and surface levels. RESULTS: Findings from 20 randomized controlled trials, which met the inclusion criteria, revealed that participants aged 1-50 showed promising results with follow-up intervals ranging from 1 to 30 months. The caries arrestment rate of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) varied from 25% to 99%. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that SDF could be an invaluable tool in combating dental caries, providing a less invasive and potentially more cost-effective alternative to traditional treatment methods. Nonetheless, further research is essential to comprehensively understand the potential of SDF in various settings and to optimize its application in clinical practice.
