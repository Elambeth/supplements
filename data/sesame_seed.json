      "abstract": "Sesame (Sesamum indicum) is an oilseed crop which is increasingly recognised as a functional food by consumers due to its nutritional and nutraceutical components. Consequently, global demand for sesame has increased significantly over the last three decades. Sesame is an important export crop in producing countries, contributing to their socio-economic development. However, in recent years, major foodborne incidents have been associated with imported sesame seeds and products made with these seeds. Foodborne hazards are a potential risk to consumer health and hinder international trade due to border rejections and increased import controls. An insight into the routes of contamination of these hazards across the value chain and factors affecting persistence may lead to more focused intervention and prevention strategies. It was observed that Salmonella is a significant microbial hazard in imported sesame seeds and has been associated with several global outbreaks. Sesame is mainly cultivated in the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia by smallholder farmers. Agricultural and manufacturing practices during harvesting, storage, and processing before export may allow for the contamination of sesame seeds with Salmonella. However, only a few studies collect data on the microbiological quality of sesame across the value chain in producing countries. In addition, the presence of mycotoxins and pesticides above regulatory limits in sesame seeds is a growing concern. Eliminating foodborne hazards in the sesame value chain requires urgent attention from researchers, producers, processors, and regulators and suggestions for improving the safety of these foods are discussed."

      "abstract": "Trichomoniasis is a common sexually transmitted infection that poses significant complications for women. Challenges in treatment include adverse effects and resistance to standard antimicrobial agents. Given this context, a sesame seed oil nanoemulsion (SONE) was developed and showed anti-Trichomonas vaginalis activity. To facilitate the local application of SONE, a polysaccharide film was developed using xanthan gum (XG) and κ-carrageenan gum (CG). A blend of XG and CG (at 2 %, ratio 1:3) plasticized with glycerol produced a more promising film (XCF) than using the gums individually. The film containing SONE (SONE-XCF) was successfully obtained by replacing the aqueous solvent with SONE via solvent evaporation technique. The hydrophilic SONE-XCF exhibited homogeneity and suitable mechanical properties for vaginal application. Furthermore, SONE-XCF demonstrated mucoadhesive properties and high absorption capacity for excessive vaginal fluids produced in vaginitis. It also had a disintegration time of over 8 h, indicating long retention at the intended site of action. Hemolysis and chorioallantoic membrane tests confirmed the safety of the film. Therefore, SONE-XCF is a biocompatible film with a natural composition and inherent activity against T. vaginalis, possessing exceptional characteristics that make it appropriate for vaginal application, offering an interesting alternative for trichomoniasis treatment.",

      "abstract": "Effects of enzyme treatment on the hypertensive potential and protein structure of black sesame seed (BSS) were investigated. Compared with BSS, Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition of fermented black sesame seed (FBSS) has significantly improved after acid protease processing and reached 75.39% at 2 U/g in 3 h. Meanwhile, the zinc chelating ability and antioxidant activity of FBSS hydrolysate as well as surface hydrophobicity, free sulfhydryl content, and peptide content of FBSS protein, were significantly increased. The results illustrated that this strategy promoted the protein unfolding and exposure of hydrophobic residues, thus contributing toward enzymatic hydrolysis. Secondary structure results indicated that the α-helix of FBSS protein and β-sheet of BSS protein decreased after hydrolyzing. The differences in ACE inhibition may also result from the difference in peptide sequence except for peptide content. In conclusion, the combination of fermentation pretreatment and enzyme treatment is an effective method to enhance the antihypertensive potential of BSS.",

Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were randomized to nondiabetic group or STZ-induced diabetic groups (n = 10/group). STZ-induced diabetic mice and 6-week-old male db/db mice (n = 10/group) were randomized to the following groups: (1) diabetic control, no treatment, (2) methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) treatment, (3) sesame seed oil (SSO) treatment, and (4) MSM+SSO combination treatment. Clinical parameters measured included weights, blood glucose, serum lipid panels, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) detection of free fatty acids in serum, liver, brain, and eyes. Blood glucose significantly decreased after 4 weeks of MSM treatment in T1D mice. Serum PUFA levels were significantly reduced in T2D mice compared with control mice. In contrast, treatment with SSO reversed this effect in T2D mice, exhibiting serum PUFA levels comparable to control mice. Serum triglycerides were significantly increased in both diabetic models compared to nondiabetic control, mimicking diabetes in people. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) was significantly increased in T1D receiving MSM+SSO and all T2D treatment groups. A corresponding significant decrease in non-HDL cholesterol was seen in T2D mice in all treatment groups. MSM+SSO treatment's effects on HDL and non-HDL cholesterol and PUFA metabolism could lead to improved clinical outcomes in diabetics by improving the lipid profile.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individual vegetable oils have a characteristic fatty acids (FA) composition and unique phytonutrient profiles, enabling formulation of oil blends that may have health-promoting effects. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to investigate effects of 2 oil blends made with refined rice bran, flaxseed, and sesame oils, with distinct monounsaturated to saturated FA, polyunsaturated to saturated FA, and omega-3 (n-3) to omega-6 FA ratios and different phytonutrient concentrations on blood lipid profile, compared with refined olive oil as a control. The secondary outcomes were other markers of cardiometabolic health. METHODS: A parallel-design, randomized controlled trial compared consumption of 30 g of allocated intervention oil per day for a period of 8 wk. The study recruited 143 borderline hypercholesterolemic (LDL cholesterol: 3.06-4.51 mmol/L) Chinese volunteers between 50 and 70 y old and with a BMI (kg/m2) ≤27.5. All outcomes were measured every 2 wk, and the time × treatment interactions and the main effects of treatment and time were analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach. RESULTS: Compared with baseline (week 0), there were significant reductions during the post-intervention time points in serum total cholesterol (-3.47%; P < 0.0001), LDL cholesterol (-4.16%; P < 0.0001), triglycerides (-10.3%; P < 0.0001), apoB (-3.93%; P < 0.0001), total to HDL-cholesterol (-3.44%; P < 0.0001) and apoB to apoA1 (-3.99%; P < 0.0001) ratios, systolic and diastolic blood pressures (-3.32% and -3.16%, respectively; both P < 0.0001), and serum glucose (-1.51%; P < 0.05) and a small but significant increase in body weight (+0.7%; P < 0.001) for all 3 intervention oils but no effects of intervention on HDL-cholesterol or apoA1 concentration. No significant effects of treatment or time × treatment interactions were found. CONCLUSIONS: Using blended vegetable oils that are extensively consumed in Asia, this study found that specific oil blends can improve blood lipid profile and other cardiometabolic parameters, to a similar extent as refined olive oil, in Chinese adults with borderline hypercholesterolemia. This trial is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03964857.",

      "abstract": "Defatted sesame seed flour is recovered as a byproduct after oil extraction and is usually considered a waste product. Previously, we showed that water-soluble fractions purified from defatted white and gold sesame seed flour exhibited good antioxidant activity in vitro. We also identified ferulic acid and vanillic acid as the bioactive antioxidants in both white and gold sesame seed water-soluble fractions (WS-wsf and GS-wsf, respectively). In this study, we hypothesized that WS-wsf and GS-wsf may have neuroprotective effects due to their antioxidant potential. Treatment with WS-wsf for 24 hours enhanced human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell viability and proliferation, while GS-wsf, ferulic acid, and vanillic acid did not show similar effects. In addition, WS-wsf (1-3 mg/mL) significantly and dose-dependently protected SH-SY5Y cells against camptothecin-induced apoptosis, suggesting the involvement of an anti-apoptosis mechanism in the neuroprotective effects of WS-wsf. In fact, treatment with WS-wsf significantly decreased the mRNA expression levels of pro-apoptotic Bax and p53 genes. WS-wsf also enhanced Bcl-2 protein level and Akt phosphorylation. Taken together, this study showed that WS-wsf has interesting neuroprotective potential via an anti-apoptotic mechanism, which is independent from its antioxidant capacity.",

In this study, the effect of chronic administration of sesame (Sesamum indicum L) seed feeding was studied on aortic reactivity of streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats. Male diabetic rats received sesame seed-mixed food at weight ratios of 3% and 6% for 7 weeks, one week after diabetes induction. Contractile responses to KCl and phenylephrine (PE) and relaxation response to acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were obtained from aortic rings. Maximum contractile response of endothelium-intact rings to PE was significantly lower in sesame-treated diabetic rats (at a ratio of 6%) relative to untreated diabetics and endothelium removal abolished this difference. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to ACh was also significantly higher in sesame-treated diabetic rats (at a ratio of 6%) as compared to diabetic rats and pretreatment of rings with nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) significantly attenuated the observed response. Two-month diabetes also resulted in an elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and sesame treatment significantly reversed the increased MDA content and restored activity of SOD. We thus conclude that chronic treatment of diabetic rats with sesame seed could in a dose-manner prevent some abnormal changes in vascular reactivity through nitric oxide and via attenuation of oxidative stress in aortic tissue and endothelium integrity is necessary for this beneficial effect."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of peanut (PN) and tree nut (TN) allergy in children has tripled in the past decade. Prenatal exposures, including maternal diet and medications, may account for some of this increase. In the United States, progesterone for luteal support in assisted reproduction is commonly formulated in PN or sesame seed (SS) oil. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether prenatal exposure to PN or SS oil as progesterone in oil increases the child's odds of PN, TN, or SS allergy. METHODS: Parents of 1,272 children evaluated by allergists from May 2005 through October 2009 completed questionnaires on conception, prenatal exposures, dietary history, and allergic history, with review of the child's medical record and skin prick and specific IgE test results. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using multivariable adjusted logistic regression models. RESULTS: Children of mothers with a history of infertility, in vitro fertilization, or use of progesterone in oil did not have increased odds of PN, TN, and/or SS sensitization. Maternal consumption of TNs during first 2 trimesters was associated with 60% higher odds of having a PN/TN/SS-sensitized child (95% confidence interval 1.01-2.51), with similarly increased odds with maternal SS ingestion. Odds of PN/TN/SS sensitization were doubled in children with asthma or environmental allergies. CONCLUSION: Neither maternal infertility nor exposure to PN or SS oils through progesterone support during assisted reproduction treatment was associated with increased odds of PN/TN/SS sensitization in the child. However, maternal ingestion of TNs and SS during pregnancy was associated with increased odds of PN/TN/SS sensitization in the child.",

This study was designed to investigate the effects of sesame on reducing serum lipids and enhancing antioxidant capacity in 38 hyperlipidemic patients who were divided into two groups randomly. For all individuals along the 60 days of study period, the same drug treatments were considered. Intervention group patients were supposed to eat 40 g white sesame seeds daily, and instead of these calories, 240 kcal was removed from their diet. Anthropometric measurements including height, weight and body mass index (BMI) were measured. We assessed lipid profile and oxidative stress indicators such as glutathione peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) before and after the intervention. Significant differences among and between the groups were determined by independent t-test and paired sample t-test using 13th version of statistical package for the social sciences. The results showed that the diet with sesame significantly decreased the levels of serum total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and TC/HDL-C ratio. Lipid peroxidation (TBARS) decreased while the activities of GPX and SOD were increased. There were no significant changes in anthropometric indexes such as weight and BMI after consumption of sesame. The results suggested that sesame seed supplementation decreased serum TC, LDL-C and lipid peroxidation, and increased antioxidant status in hyperlipidemic patients.",

Sesame seed (SS) is rich in the lignan sesamin (SES) but is non-protective. Both lignans are metabolized to estrogen-like enterodiol and enterolactone. The objective of this study was to differentiate the effects of SDG and SES on established human estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors (MCF-7) in athymic mice with high serum estrogen to help explain the different effects of FS and SS. Mice were fed for 8 wk the basal diet (BD, control) or BD supplemented with 1 g/kg SDG or SES. SES reduced palpable tumor size by 23% compared to control, whereas SDG did not differ from SES or control. Both treatments reduced tumor cell proliferation, but only SES increased apoptosis. SDG and SES reduced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and endothelial growth factor receptor expressions, but only SES reduced downstream pMAPK. Neither treatment affected IGF-1R, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, Akt, pAkt, or MAPK of the growth factor signaling pathway. Thus, at high serum estrogen levels, SDG may not account for the tumor reducing effect of FS. SES was more effective than SDG in reducing breast tumor growth, but its effect may have been lost when consumed as a component of SS.",

Ingestion of sesame seed produces mammalian lignans comparable with flaxseed, but its anticancer potential is unknown. This study determined the interactive effects of sesame seed and tamoxifen on established MCF-7 tumor growth and bone health in ovariectomized athymic mice simulating a postmenopausal condition. DESIGN: Mice with established MCF-7 tumors were treated for 8 weeks with (1) basal diet (negative control), (2) 10% sesame seed, (3) basal diet + tamoxifen implant, (4) 10% sesame seed + tamoxifen implant, or (5) basal diet + estrogen implant (positive control). Weekly palpable tumor size, final tumor weight, cell proliferation, and apoptosis were measured. Bone mineral content, bone mineral density, and biomechanical strength testing were performed on the femur and lumbar vertebrae. RESULTS: Sesame seed induced regression of established tumor size similar to the negative control but tended to negate the tumor-inhibitory effect of tamoxifen, in part by reducing apoptosis. Sesame seed combined with tamoxifen induced higher bone mineral content, bone mineral density, and biomechanical strength in the femur and lumbar vertebrae than either treatment alone. A significant positive relationship was found between final tumor weight and bone strength parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Sesame seed is not protective and negatively interferes with tamoxifen in inducing regression of established MCF-7 tumor size but beneficially interacts with tamoxifen on bone in ovariectomized athymic mice.",
