      "abstract": "A randomized control trial was conducted to investigate the synergistic effects of Gotu kola supplementation and multicomponent exercise on cognitive function, inflammation, and oxidative stress in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Sixty participants aged 74.6±7.3 years with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores of 20.7±2.6 were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a multicomponent exercise training group (EXE, n=20), a multicomponent exercise training with Gotu kola supplementation group (EXE+GK, n=20), or a placebo-controlled group (CON, n=20). Each participant received one capsule of placebo or 500 mg twice a day of Gotu kola extract. The multicomponent exercise program comprised of supervised resistance, aerobic, balance and dual-task training: three 80-min sessions/week for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes, such as cognitive function, inflammatory markers, and oxidative stress, were measured before and after the 12-week intervention. Following the interventions, the EXE and EXE+GK had significantly higher MMSE (P<0.01), Digit Span Forward test (DSF) (P<0.01), Digit Span Backward test (P<0.01) scores, and lower Trail Making Test parts A (P<0.01) and B (P<0.01) and lower 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (P<0.01) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) (P<0.01) than the CON. The change in DSF and TNF-α in the EXE+GK had a negative correlation (r=-0.504, P<0.05). In conclusion, multicomponent exercise training with or without the supplement Gotu kola improves cognitive function, inflammation, and oxidative stress in older adults with MCI. Although supplementing with Gotu kola had no additional effects on cognitive function, it may improve the effects of multicomponent exercise on executive function by decreasing TNF-α levels."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Impairment of hippocampus function as a center for memory processing occurs due to stress. Centella asiatica L. (Gotu kola) is known to improve memory, intelligence, and neural protection although the precise mechanism is not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of ethanol extracts of C. asiatica toward MAPK expression as down-stream signaling of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a chronic electrical stress model on 20 male Sprague Dawley rats (2 months-old, 180-200 g). Rats were divided into four groups: normal control group (Control) which received distilled water, and three treatment groups receiving oral Gotu kola ethanol extracts in oral doses of 150 mg/kg BW (CeA150), 300 mg/kg BW (CeA300), and 600 mg/kg BW (CeA600) over four weeks. Memory acquisition was assessed with Morris water maze. Hippocampus was harvested, then extracted for protein and RNA analysis. MAPK proteins (p38, ERK1/2, JNK) were measured using Western blot, meanwhile, BDNF and TrkB receptor were analyzed with real-time PCR (RT-PCR). RESULTS: CeA600 group revealed improvement of memory performance as shown by reduction in time and distance parameters compared to control during escape latency test. This finding associated with significant elevation of hippocampal BDNF protein and mRNA level with up-regulation of TrkB mRNA expression in CeA600 group compared to control. Western-blot analysis showed significant up-regulation of ERK1/2 protein level in CeA600 group (P<0.05) compare to control. CONCLUSION: BDNF signaling through TrkB and ERK1/2 pathway contributes significantly to amelioration of memory performance after C. asiatica treatment in electrical stress model."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) leads to inflammation, fibrosis and destruction of the renal architecture. Centella asiatica (CeA) is an herbaceous plant with anti-inflammatory effects. We aimed to elucidate the effect of CeA on inflammation, fibrosis, vascular remodelling and antifibrotic substances in a 5/6 subtotal nephrectomy (SN) model in mice. METHODS: Mice were divided into three groups: sham operation (SO, n = 6), 5/6 SN for seven days (SN7, n = 7) and SN7 with oral CeA treatment (SN7-CeA, n = 7). At day 7, mice were euthanised, kidneys were harvested and stained with periodic-acid Schiff (for tubular injury and glomerulosclerosis) and sirius red (for fibrosis and vascular remodeling) staining. mRNA expression of prepro-endothelin-1, nephrin, E-cadherin, bone morphogenic protein-7 (BMP-7), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were quantified using reverse transcriptase-PCR. RESULTS: SN group demonstrated significant higher interstitial fibrosis, vascular remodeling, tubular injury and glomerulosclerosis (P < 0.01) compared to SO group. Meanwhile, in SN7-CeA demonstrated attenuation of vascular remodeling as shown by significant higher lumen area with lower Wall/Lumen area ratio compared to SN7. RT-PCR analysis showed up-regulation of nephrin, BMP-7 and E-cadherin mRNA expression (P < 0.05) and down-regulation of ppET-1 in SN7-CeA group compared to SN7 group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CeA may ameliorate renal injury in the SN model in mice."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of gotu kola (Centella asiatica) in improving cognitive function in patients with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). This study uses a quasi-experimental design. Subjects in this study were patients with poststroke cognitive impairment who were treated at two hospitals in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The number of subjects was 48: 17 subjects were treated with 1000 mg/day of gotu kola extract, 17 subjects treated with 750 mg/day of gotu kola extract, and 14 subjects treated with 3 mg/day of folic acid for 6 weeks. A Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Indonesian version (MoCA-Ina) was conducted at the beginning of treatment and after 6 weeks of therapy. It was found that all trials effectively improved poststroke VCI based on MoCA-Ina scores over the course of the study. There is no significant difference in ΔMoCA-Ina (score at the 6th week of treatment - score at the beginning) mean score among the three groups, indicating that gotu kola is as effective as folic acid in improving poststroke VCI. Gotu kola was shown to be more effective than folic acid in improving memory domain. This study suggested that gotu kola extract is effective in improving cognitive function after stroke."

      "abstract": "Herbal medication use continues to rise and interactions with existing medications propose risks and may have significant effects and consequences on the administration of anesthesia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of asiatic acid and its potential modulation of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor. Fifty-five male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups: vehicle (DMSO), asiatic acid (AA), midazolam, or a combination of flumazenil + AA or midazolam + AA, and injected intraperitoneally 30 minutes prior to testing. The rats were tested on the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) and the Forced Swim Test (FST). Data were analyzed using a two-tailed multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Significance was found regarding the ratio of open arm time, maximum speed, and time spent mobile in the AA group and the midazolam + AA group (P < .05). Flumazenil decreased the anxiolytic effects, suggesting that AA modulates the benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor. Further studies are recommended to determine the efficacy of prolonged treatment for anxiety and depression.",

      "abstract": "Investigations of the pharmacologic profile of medicinal plants have revealed that a number of plants with purported anxiolytic activity bind to cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors. This finding is intriguing in view of the proposed involvement of CCK in the pathophysiology of fear and anxiety. This double-blind, placebo-controlled study was undertaken to evaluate the anxiolytic activity of Gotu Kola (Centella asiatica) in healthy subjects. Gotu Kola has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicine to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. Recent studies in the rat have shown that long-term pretreatment with Gotu Kola decreases locomotor activity, enhances elevated-plus maze performance, and attenuates the acoustic startle response (ASR). In this study, the authors evaluated the effects of Gotu Kola on the ASR in humans. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either a single 12-g orally administered dose of Gotu Kola (N = 20) or placebo (N = 20). The results revealed that compared with placebo, Gotu Kola significantly attenuated the peak ASR amplitude 30 and 60 minutes after treatment. Gotu Kola had no significant effect on self-rated mood, heart rate, or blood pressure. These preliminary findings suggest that Gotu Kola has anxiolytic activity in humans as revealed by the ASR. It remains to be seen whether this herb has therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of anxiety syndromes.",
