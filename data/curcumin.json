      "abstract": "Curcumin has strong anti-inflammatory properties and promotes the osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). The aim of this study was to explore the role and potential molecular mechanism of curcumin in ameliorating osteogenic differentiation disorders caused by inflammation. We used LPS to induce an inflammatory response in hBMSCs. The expression of related mRNAs and proteins was detected by RT‒qPCR, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and ELISA. The osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs was detected by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and alizarin red S (ARS) staining. The results showed that after LPS treatment, the levels of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in hBMSCs increased, and the activity of ALP, the level of calcium salt deposition and the expression levels of the osteogenic proteins Runx2, COL1, OCN and OPN significantly decreased. The curcumin treatment alleviated this effect. These results indicated that curcumin improved the LPS-induced inflammation and osteogenic differentiation disorder in hBMSCs. Further studies revealed that the therapeutic effect of curcumin was caused by the inhibition of HMGB1 expression. From a mechanistic perspective, curcumin inhibits LPS-induced inflammation by inhibiting the expression of HMGB1, thereby inhibiting the NF-κB pathway and activating the NRF2 pathway, thereby improving the disordered osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. In conclusion, curcumin can reduce the LPS-induced inflammation of hBMSCs and ameliorate their osteogenic differentiation disorders."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: HIV persists in central nervous system (CNS) reservoirs, where infected microglia and macrophages drive neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal damage, contributing to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems, particularly poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles, offer a promising strategy to improve CNS antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivery. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of co-administration of PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulating elvitegravir (EVG) and curcumin (CUR) in targeting CNS reservoirs, reducing neuroinflammation, and mitigating oxidative stress. Methods: PLGA NPs encapsulating EVG and CUR (PLGA-EVG and PLGA-CUR) were prepared via the nanoprecipitation method. The NPs were characterized for size, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency (EE). Their therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in vitro using U1 macrophages and in vivo in Balb/c mice. Key parameters, including cytokine levels, oxidative stress markers, and neuronal marker expression, were analyzed. Results: The PLGA-EVG and PLGA-CUR NPs demonstrated high EE% (~90.63 ± 4.21 for EVG and 87.59 ± 3.42 for CUR) and sizes under 140 nm, ensuring blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. In vitro studies showed enhanced intracellular EVG concentrations and reductions in proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-18) and improved antioxidant capacity in U1 macrophages. In vivo, the co-administration of NPs improved CNS drug delivery, reduced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and preserved neuronal markers (L1CAM, synaptophysin, NeuN, GFAP). Conclusions: PLGA-based co-delivery of EVG and CUR enhances ART CNS drug delivery, mitigating neuroinflammation and reducing oxidative stress. These findings highlight the potential of nanoparticle-based ART strategies to address limitations in current regimens and pave the way for more effective HAND therapies. Future studies should focus on optimizing formulations and evaluating safety in chronic HIV settings."

      "abstract": "Currently, conventional antidepressants are often limited by poor efficacy and delayed onset, and there is an urgent need for the development of rapid acting antidepressant alternatives. The aim of this study was to develop novel antidepressants with a rapid onset of action by inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress. A series of chlorine-containing curcumin analogues were designed and synthesized. Among them, compound CAK06 exhibited the highest potency and most robust antidepressant activity, as demonstrated through ABTS free radical ion scavenging assays, relative proliferation rate measurements, and both hydrogen peroxide and corticosterone injury models. In the lipopolysaccharide-induced BV2 cell stress model, treatment with CAK06 resulted in a 69 ​% decrease in nitric oxide levels and a 52 ​% reduction in the fluorescence intensity of reactive oxygen species compared to the model group. qRT-PCR results showed that CAK06 upregulated the expression of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant genes while downregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. In the CUMS depression model, CAK06 exerted rapid antidepressant effects after 14 days of oral administration. Notably, after 28 days, CAK06 produced a more pronounced improvement in depression-like behaviors compared to the widely used antidepressant fluoxetine. Mechanistically, molecular docking, Western blot, and Elisa results indicated that CAK06 may alleviate oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and enhance synaptic plasticity in CUMS mice via the Nrf2-HO-1/BDNF-TrkB pathway. These results suggest that the new compound CAK06 exhibits rapid antidepressant effects, positioning it as a promising novel antidepressant candidate."

AIM OF THE STUDY: The current study aimed to examine cytotoxicity, antioxidant and apoptotic Activity of Curcumin nanoparticles on squamous cell carcinoma (HEp-2). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present work conducted to evaluate the cytotoxicity using MTT assay, evaluation of morphological changes post cell treatment with Curcumin nanoparticles, also evaluation of cell apoptosis using Annexin V-FITC and Propidium Iodide (PI) staining. Finally, Genotoxicity was traced via arranging for flow cytometry. RESULTS: Data recorded revealed that the inhibitory concentration (IC50) of Curcumin nanoparticles was 40.82 ug/ ml. Also, cytotoxicity was concentration dependent with significant difference (p<0.05). Cytotoxicity enhanced apoptosis process accompanied with cell cycle arrest through the induction of G2/M and pre-G1 phases arrest compared with that of control cell. Cytotoxicity accompanied with morphological changes denoting apoptosis and necrosis after treatment with Curcumin nanoparticles. In the meantime, the biochemical marker (ROS) was elevated in a significant way post treatment with Curcumin nanoparticles. CONCLUSION: Nanocurcumin has a potent anticancer effect due to its antioxidant and anticancer activity.",

Our research overcomes this challenge by means of nanotechnology in order to transform hydrophobic compounds into stable aqueous solutions, enabling them to use their full potential and unique properties in cancer therapy. In this study, the novel nano-composite cGQDs-PEG-curcumin was developed to overcome the insolubility of curcumin in water and its extraordinary efficacy in PDT was evaluated. Complex characterization was performed using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), FTIR, and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Further analysis involved fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), and its cellular localization was mapped with confocal microscopy. In order to evaluate PDT effectiveness, cells treated with cGQDs-PEG-curcumin were irradiated with 5 J/cm2 of 414 nm light. After irradiation, cell viability assay, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection, comet assay, and γH2AX-based DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) detection were assessed and revealed a remarkable ability of the nano-composite to induce DNA damage after irradiation without ROS production. Our findings highlight the potential of cGQDs-PEG-curcumin as a cutting-edge PDT agent, capable of disrupting cell membrane and nucleolar integrity and impairing ribosomal synthesis, which is crucial for proliferating tumour cells."

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a serious concern worldwide. The published reports showed that aberrant CD95 receptor expression plays a critical role in apoptosis in liver cancer. While curcumin has shown promise in inducing apoptosis in liver cancer cells, its direct effects on CD95 expression during this process have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to quantitatively assess the expression of the CD95 receptor in HepG2 cells treated with different concentrations of curcumin using techniques such as fluorescence staining, single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), and single-molecule recognition imaging (SMRI). Fluorescence staining results indicate a significant increase in CD95 expression following curcumin treatment. For the first time, SMFS and SMRI techniques were used to directly reveal the binding sites of CD95 on the cell membrane, with the number of binding sites increasing as the curcumin concentration increased. Additionally, the binding force between an antibody-modified probe and CD95 was strengthened with curcumin treatment, suggesting that curcumin enhances both the quantity and affinity of CD95 binding sites. This study provides new insights into curcumin-induced CD95-mediated apoptosis in liver cancer cells and highlights the potential of AFM techniques for investigating drug mechanisms. Overall, these findings may inform innovative therapeutic strategies for liver cancer and improve drug design processes."

      "abstract": "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of hematological malignancies, demonstrating high efficacy in targeting and eliminating cancer cells. However, its clinical application can be associated with the risk of acute adverse effects, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a severe inflammatory response caused by excessive cytokine production. While anti-cytokine therapies are available to manage CRS, additional strategies are needed to optimize CAR T-cell efficacy with reduced toxicities. Curcumin, a bioactive polyphenol known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, represents a promising adjunct for CAR T-cell therapy. In this study, we investigated the effects of curcumin on anti-CD19 CAR T-cells in vitro. Our results show that curcumin enhances the cytotoxic activity of CAR T-cells against Nalm-6, a B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia model, while reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-2 and IFN-γ. To explore its underlying mechanisms, network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses were performed, which revealed that curcumin interacts with key signaling pathways involved in T-cell activation and cytokine regulation. These findings support the potential of curcumin as a therapeutic adjunct to improve CAR T-cell efficacy while mitigating inflammatory toxicity."

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Conventional treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy are often associated with severe side effects and limited effectiveness. Curcumin, a polyphenol derived from Curcuma longa, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties. A systematic review of the recent scientific literature followed PRISMA guidelines to evaluate the benefits of a curcumin-enriched diet for adults with colorectal cancer. Articles published between 2018 and 2024 were retrieved from PubMed, SciELO, Google Scholar, and Scopus. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria focused on curcumin, adults, and colorectal cancer outcomes. The administration of curcumin-containing products was associated with improved survival rates, enhanced quality of life, tumor reduction, and anti-inflammatory effects. A curcumin-enriched diet shows potential as an effective adjunct therapy for CRC patients, though its limited bioavailability and potential side effects, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, pose challenges. Addressing these limitations through larger cohorts, extended study durations, and improved formulations to enhance bioavailability is essential. Such efforts could enable the development of personalized dietary recommendations for CRC management."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of curcumin on neuroinflammation and cognitive function in a rat model of febrile convulsions (FC). This study was conducted on 10-day-old male Wistar rat pups, randomly assigned to four groups: Control, Curcumin, FC, and FC + Curcumin. FC were induced by placing the rats in a 44 °C water bath until convulsions occurred or for a maximum of 4 min. Curcumin (200 mg/kg/day) was administered intraperitoneally for seven consecutive days before FC induction. Neuroinflammation was assessed by measuring hippocampal and serum TNF-α and IL-1β levels using ELISA. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test, where escape latency, swimming speed, and distance traveled were recorded, followed by a probe test on Day 5 to assess memory retention. Motor coordination was assessed using the Rotarod test, measuring latency to fall. Curcumin treatment significantly reduced hippocampal TNF-α levels in the FC model (FC group: 145.3 ± 12.1 pg/mL vs. FC + Curcumin group: 98.6 ± 9.4 pg/mL, p = 0.001). In the MWM test, curcumin-treated rats exhibited shorter escape latencies and improved spatial memory performance compared to the FC group (p < 0.05). By Day 4, the curcumin-treated group had a significantly shorter escape latency (FC group: 42.8 ± 5.9 s vs. FC + Curcumin group: 25.3 ± 4.1 s, p = 0.002) and traveled a shorter distance to reach the platform (FC group: 335.4 ± 22.8 cm vs. FC + Curcumin group: 192.6 ± 18.3 cm, p = 0.001). Curcumin administration significantly reduced FC termination time (FC group: 96.7 ± 7.4 s vs. FC + Curcumin group: 62.5 ± 5.9 s, p = 0.001). Curcumin exerts neuroprotective effects in FC by reducing hippocampal neuroinflammation and improving cognitive function. These findings suggest that curcumin could be a promising therapeutic agent in managing febrile seizure-related neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction. Further studies are warranted to explore its long-term efficacy and clinical applicability.",

Induction and maintenance of remission is a crucial therapeutic goal. We investigated curcumin's efficacy in treatment of pouchitis. METHODS: The double-blind trial included an induction cohort of refractory pouchitis patients and a maintenance cohort of patients without pouchitis after IPAA. Patients received either placebo or curcumin for 8 weeks. The pouchitis activity were assessed before and after and was compared between cohorts or groups. Laboratory inflammation indicators, nutritional status and quality of life were also appraised. RESULTS: 52 patients were included, with 39 and 13 patients entering the maintenance cohort and induction cohort, respectively. In maintenance cohort, the proportion of clinical remission elevated from 11 to 89% in curcumin group (p = 0.005), whereas there was no significant difference in placebo group (10% vs 5%, p = 1).In induction cohort, 67% (4/6) patients achieved clinical response after 8 weeks' intervention of curcumin, whereas none treated with placebo (p = 0.021). Patients treated with curcumin appeared less inflammation and there was no significant difference in indicators changes between two cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Curcumin has preventive and therapeutic effects on pouchitis. Curcumin supplementation can reduce the disease activity and improve the nutritional status of patients with after IPAA.

In the present study, we demonstrated that an ancient drug curcumin was associated with selective accumulation of phosphorylated β-catenin (PBC) tagged with both ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like (Ubl) protein NEDD8. We further identified USP14, a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) in 19S proteasome, as a functional target of curcumin in modulating β-catenin. Curcumin enhances USP14-mediated PBC trapping and modulates proteasome associations, loss of USP14 significantly attenuated curcumin-increased PBC. Additionally, we found that USP14 deficiency suppressed mitotic entry and cell proliferation, targeting USP14 and PBC was essential for curcumin inhibition of cancer. Taken together, our study not only revealed the association of USP14 with PBC degradation within the proteasome, but also provided a unique small molecule curcumin targeting USP14 to modulate β-catenin for cancer therapy."

The optimized micellar formulation (9:1 TPGS/DPPC) yielded nanomicelles (∼18 nm) with high encapsulation efficiency (∼90%) and a zeta potential of -1.24 mV, demonstrating stability for pulmonary administration. In vitro cytotoxicity studies demonstrated enhanced anticancer activity of CUR- and ICA-loaded micelles against A549 lung cancer cells (IC50 = 3.0 μg/mL), lower than doxorubicin (30 μg/mL), suggesting enhanced cytotoxic potential. Additionally, DPPH assays confirmed that encapsulation preserved curcumin's functionality. Aerosolization studies demonstrated a high fine particle fraction (67 ± 3%) and emitted fraction (95 ± 1.0%), confirming the micelles' suitability for deep lung deposition and effective pulmonary drug delivery. These findings highlight the potential of CUR- and ICA-loaded micelles as an inhalable NSCLC treatment, requiring further preclinical investigation."

      "abstract": "The synthetic DSPE-PEG2000-C3 peptide and DSPE-PEG2000-TPP were designed to modify the exosomes (EXO) by incubation, through which guide the C3/TPP-EXO to target the injured mitochondria of neurons. Then, C3/TPP-EXO was further used to encapsulate the curcumin (CUR) to enhance the solubility and bioavailability of the drug. By intravenously injected (i.v) into taup301s mutant transgenic (Tg) mice, C3/TPP-EXO facilitated the CUR to target the mitochondria of neurons and increase the entry efficiency of medication. To further reveal the mechanisms of drug entry, sodium azide (NaN3), an energy inhibitor, was used to treat HT22 cells. The results demonstrated that the entrance efficiency of the engineered EXO is significantly affected suggesting that C3/TPP-EXO may target mitochondria through energy routes. To deeply study the exact molecular mechanisms of C3/TPP-EXO-CUR in treating AD, RNA-Seq was used to identify the relevant molecules. Through GO annotation, many genes are enriched in the pathways of mitochondria functions. Based on these RNA-Seq data, C3/TPP-EXO-CUR showed neuroprotective effects via modulating the protein expression of Bcl-2, Bax and caspase-3 in HT22 cells. To further confirm the in vitro results, the in vivo results revealed that C3/TPP-EXO-CUR treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of tau and protected neurons by inhibiting the apoptotic genes, leading to improve the memory decline of taup301s mice. Collectively, the current study revealed the benefits and mechanisms of C3/TPP-EXO-CUR for treating AD, which might provide a novel and effective therapeutic approach for the disease."

Due to limited bioavailability of curcumin, it remains almost unknown whether acutely treated curcumin influences cognitive function and underlying neural activity. To address this question, we monitored behavior and neural activity in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex of mice treated with vehicle or curcumin while they were engaged in a novel object recognition task. Object recognition memory performance in the novel object recognition task was increased in curcumin-treated mice. Moreover, delta oscillations in the hippocampus were enhanced in the curcumin-administered mice in the test trial.

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone (γ-VL), recently identified as a predominant microbial metabolite derived from proanthocyanidins, offers benefits such as reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and supporting brain health. Its effects on neuroinflammation and microglial activation remain largely unexplored. Curcumin, a bioactive component isolated from Curcuma longa L., is well known for its ability to reduce microglial activation and pro-inflammatory mediator production and release. While the individual effects of γ-VL and curcumin are well documented, their potential combined effects remain unexplored. This research sought to investigate the possible synergistic effects of γ-VL and curcumin in reducing microglial activation. Methods: Primary rat cortical microglia were pre-treated with γ-VL and curcumin, alone or in combination, before stimulation with LPS. An MTT assay was used to evaluate cell viability, while pro-inflammatory mediators were assessed by real-time PCR and ELISA. Nitric oxide production was evaluated with the Griess assay. SynergyFinder Plus software analyzed potential synergistic effects. Results: The combination of low micromolar concentrations of γ-VL and curcumin synergistically reduced LPS-induced microglial activation. Specifically, the combination exhibited a significantly greater ability to inhibit the production and release of pro-inflammatory factors (such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and NO) compared to each compound individually. Mechanistically, the anti-inflammatory activity was attributed to the downregulation of NLRP3 expression, and the reduction in microglial activation was linked to the modulation of the NOX2/Nrf2 signaling pathway. Conclusions: The combination of low micromolar concentrations of γ-VL and curcumin produces synergistic anti-inflammatory effects in microglia by targeting key inflammatory pathways, indicating its potential utility as a treatment strategy for neurodegenerative diseases involving microglial activation.",

Therapeutic alternatives, such as the polyphenolic antioxidants curcumin and resveratrol in liposome form, or the drug dutasteride, could be effective for muscular activity. Objective: To measure the acute change in electrical muscle activation after administration of a combination of curcumin in liposomal form, resveratrol, and dutasteride in patients with ALS. Materials and methods: Patients with bulbar and spinal ALS were selected and randomly distributed into an intervention group (IG), which received an oral combination of curcumin in liposomal form/resveratrol® and dutasteride for 2 months, and a control group (CG), which received a placebo. Electrical activity to determine basal muscle activation and fasciculations was measured before and after the intervention using surface electromyography of the biceps brachii (BB), triceps brachii (TB), rectus femoris (RF), and tibialis anterior (TA). Within comparisons of pre and post-muscular variations in each group were conducted. Results: Electrical basal activity increased only for the IG in the right (p = 0.05; g = -0.45) and left (p = 0.004; g = -0.74) hemibody muscles and also presented less variation among them after treatment in the IG. For fasciculations, there was an increase in the total activation of the upper muscles in the IG (p = 0.017; g = -0.86) and for the lower muscles in the CG (p = 0.037; g = -0.68). The pattern of muscle activation remained constant in the IG but experienced variations in the CG."

      "abstract": "Background: Anticancer therapies represent the primary treatment option for a significant number of cancer patients globally; however, many of these treatments are associated with severe side effects as they target molecular structures present in both cancerous and healthy cells. In a similar context, the treatment of Chagas disease, a neglected tropical illness, is hindered by the high toxicity of the currently available drugs. Researchers are increasingly focusing on the development of safer and more selective alternatives, with natural compounds being studied as potential starting points for the creation of more effective drug candidates with a favorable therapeutic index. Objectives: The aim of this study was to design simplified curcumin-derived structures that preserved or enhanced their therapeutic activity against human lung cancer cell lines and T. cruzi, while also improving bioavailability and minimizing toxicity. Methods: In this study, curcumin and two natural curcuminoids inspired the synthesis of a chalcone and a set of bis-chalcones, compound classes known for their enhanced stability compared with their natural parent derivatives. The synthetic strategy used was the acid-catalyzed aldol condensation reaction. The stability profiles, IC50 values against A549 and H460 tumor cell lines, and trypanocidal activity against T. cruzi amastigotes of these derivatives were assessed. Results: The synthesized derivatives exhibited improved stability compared with the parent compounds, along with lower IC50 values in both A549 and H460 tumor cell lines. Additionally, one of the new analogs showed promising trypanocidal activity against T. cruzi amastigotes. Conclusions: This study provides a potential pathway toward the development of more effective and less toxic treatments for both cancer and Chagas disease. The simplified curcumin derivatives represent a promising foundation for designing new therapeutic agents with improved bioavailability and efficacy."

      "abstract": "Background: Liver cancer, especially hepatocellular carcinoma, a prevalent malignant tumor of the digestive system, poses significant therapeutic challenges. While traditional chemotherapy can inhibit tumor progression, its clinical application is limited by insufficient efficacy. Hydrophobic therapeutic agents further encounter challenges including low tumor specificity, poor bioavailability, and severe systemic toxicity. This study aimed to develop a liver-targeted, glutathione (GSH)-responsive micellar system to synergistically enhance drug delivery and antitumor efficacy. Methods: A GSH-responsive disulfide bond was chemically synthesized to conjugate glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) with curcumin (Cur) at a molar ratio of 1:1, forming a prodrug Cur-GA (CGA). This prodrug was co-assembled with glycyrrhizic acid (GL) at a 300% w/w loading ratio into micelles. The system was characterized for physicochemical properties, in vitro drug release in PBS (7.4) without GSH and in PBS (5.0) with 0, 5, or 10 mM GSH, cellular uptake in HepG2 cells, and in vivo efficacy in H22 hepatoma-bearing BALB/c mice. Results: The optimized micelles exhibited a hydrodynamic diameter of 157.67 ± 2.14 nm (PDI: 0.20 ± 0.02) and spherical morphology under TEM. The concentration of CUR in micelles can reach 1.04 mg/mL. In vitro release profiles confirmed GSH-dependent drug release, with 67.5% vs. <40% cumulative Cur release observed at 24 h with/without 10 mM GSH. Flow cytometry and high-content imaging revealed 1.8-fold higher cellular uptake of CGA-GL micelles compared to free drug (p < 0.001). In vivo, CGA-GL micelles achieving 3.6-fold higher tumor accumulation than non-targeted controls (p < 0.001), leading to 58.7% tumor volume reduction (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The GA/GL-based micellar system synergistically enhanced efficacy through active targeting and stimuli-responsive release, providing a promising approach to overcome current limitations in hydrophobic drug delivery for hepatocellular carcinoma therapy."

It's important to prevent and treat these issues, especially since medication options during breastfeeding may be limited. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of curcumin, a natural substance known for its beneficial properties, on postpartum depression and anxiety in primiparous women. A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on 96 primiparous women in Tabriz City. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n = 48) or the control group (n = 48) using the random block method. The intervention group received curcumin capsules with a dose of 500 mg, while the control group received a placebo with the same dose once daily for eight weeks. Data was collected using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and postpartum-specific Anxiety Scale research short-form (PSAS-RSF) questionnaires. After the intervention, the mean score of depression (mean difference: -2.5; 95% confidence interval: -3.3 to -1.7; P < 0.001) and anxiety (Mean difference: -1.4; 95% confidence interval: -2.1 to -0.7; P < 0.001) in the intervention group were significantly lower than the control group. It seems that curcumin can improve the mental health and quality of life of primiparous women postpartum due to its efficacy in reducing postpartum anxiety and depression, easy accessibility, and cost-effectiveness.",

Rapid gelling hydrogels can overcome this limitation by providing localized delivery of anti-cancer agents to solid tumors. Silk hydrogels are extremely biocompatible and suitable for anti-cancer drug delivery, but faster gelling formulations are needed. In this study, we introduce a rapid gelling hydrogel formulation (<3 min gelling time) due to chemical crosslinking between silk fibroin and curcumin, initiated by the addition of minute quantities of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The novel observation in this study is that curcumin, while being a free-radical scavenger, also participates in accelerating silk di-tyrosine crosslinking in the presence of HRP and H2O2. Using UV-Vis, rheology, and time-lapse videos, we convincingly show that curcumin accelerates silk di-tyrosine crosslinking reaction in a concentration-dependent manner, and curcumin remains entrapped in the hydrogel post-crosslinking. FTIR results show an increase in secondary beta-sheet structures within hydrogels, with increasing concentrations of curcumin. Furthermore, we show that curcumin-silk di-tyrosine hydrogels are toxic to U2OS osteosarcoma cells, and most cancer cells are dead within short time scales of 4 h post-encapsulation."

      "abstract": "The blood-testis barrier (BTB) is composed of tight junctions (TJ) between adjacent Sertoli cells (SCs) and is crucial for sperm growth and development. Aging-induced TJ impairment is closely related to testicular dysfunction. Curcumin, a natural compound, has been widely demonstrated to have a wide range of pharmacological activities, but its regulatory effects on tight junction damage in the testis remain unclear. We here explored the effect of curcumin on TJ function and its underlying molecular mechanism by using D-galactose (D-gal)-induced mouse testis and mouse testicular SCs (TM4) aging models in vitro. In this study, D-gal increased the expression of aging-related proteins p16 and p21, whereas significantly decreased the expression of TJ proteins (ZO-1, Claudin-4, Claudin-7, and Occludin). In addition, curcumin restored the adverse effects of D-gal in the SCs. Autophagy is a degradation system for maintaining cell renewal and homeostasis. D-gal significantly decreased the autophagy level, whereas curcumin restored the effect of D-gal. Using chloroquine (CQ), an inhibitor of autophagy, and rapamycin (RAPA), an activator of autophagy, it was demonstrated that autophagy plays a key role in curcumin amelioration of TJ injury in testicular SCs. Further studies unveiled that autophagy activation was mediated through the AMPK/mTOR pathway. In conclusion, curcumin ameliorates aging-induced TJ damage through AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway-regulated autophagy. This study thus clearly identifies a novel action mechanism of curcumin in the treatment of age-related male reproductive disorders.",

The QPI dispersion was sonicated to generate nanoparticles for the production of HIPPEs. Thermal treatments caused the reduction in the particle size and increased water contact angle compared to the control QPI nanoparticles, and further improving the emulsion properties of QPI. The microstructure results further supported the nature of oil-in-water of HIPPEs stabilized by QPI nanoparticles by showing that the nanoparticles formed a tight interfacial film and closely coated the surface of oil droplets. Thermal treatment reduced the droplet size by approximately 11%, 15%, and 3% for HIPPEs stabilized by AB-QPI, HPB-QPI, and B-QPI, respectively, compared to those of control QPI, which effectively improved the emulsion's viscoelasticity and storage stability. Retention rate and bioaccessibility of CUR and AST in HIPPEs were improved compared to the encapsulation by corn oil, showing HPB-QPI > AB-QPI > B-QPI > control QPI. HIPPEs stabilized by thermally treated QPI-protected lipophilic bioactive compounds and were beneficial for the advancement of functional foods based on QPI. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The emulsifying properties of QPI nanoparticles were significantly improved after thermal treatment. High internal phase Pickering emulsion stabilized by thermally treated QPI nanoparticles significantly improved the stability and bioaccessibility of curcumin and astaxanthin. It provides a theoretical basis for utilizing thermally treated QPI nanoparticles as emulsifiers in delivery systems, broadening the development of curcumin and astaxanthin in the food and pharmaceutical fields.",

This study investigates the role of cocrystal technology in overcoming these limitations through the formation of curcumin-piperine (CUR-PIP) cocrystals (CoCry). The CUR-PIP CoCry was evaluated for its ability to suppress IGF2 over expression in UBC. Molecular interactions were predicted via Auto Dock simulations, and the co crystals were characterized using FTIR, DSC, PXRD, SEM, and ssNMR. Saturation solubility, dissolution, permeability, and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies were conducted. The therapeutic efficacy of CUR-PIP CoCry was tested in a bladder cancer rat model induced by N-Methyl Nitrosourea; with IGF2 expression quantified using qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. The CUR-PIP CoCry demonstrated enhanced drug release and permeability compared to CUR alone. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a 5.7-fold increase in Cmax and a 7.9-fold increase in AUC0-12 hr compared to CUR alone. In vivo studies using an MNU-induced bladder cancer rat model demonstrated that CUR-PIP CoCry significantly suppressed IGF2 expression (p < 0.001) and enhanced anticancer efficacy. This study underscores the potential of cocrystallization as a novel approach to enhance bioavailability and therapeutic effectiveness in cancer treatment."

Following PVP modification, the PB-Cur nanozyme exhibited favorable biocompatibility and stability in aqueous solutions. Furthermore, the PB-Cur nanozyme shows remarkable reversible treatment efficacy against myocardial hypertrophy in both in vitro and in vivo models. After one week of treatment, the PB-Cur group in the transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced cardiac hypertrophy models displayed a notable decrease in myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis. Echocardiographic findings also revealed a substantial improvement in cardiac function among TAC mice following PB-Cur administration. Mechanistically, through reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination, the PB-Cur effectively downregulated oxidative stress-related pathways, including MAPK and PI3K-Akt, which hold promise for treating oxidative stress-related cardiac diseases."

      "abstract": "The growing interest in peripheral nerve regeneration and developing post-traumatic repair methods under diabetes was the impetus for this study, which aims to investigate the effect of curcumin and Garcinia kola on the transected and diabetic sciatic nerves. 35 male Wistar albino rats were used. The animals were divided into five groups; each consisted of seven rats. The sciatic nerve was transected in all groups of rats except for the control (Cont) group, which underwent no treatment. In the transected animals, a 10 mm nerve stump was removed from the two cm distal to the sciatic notch. The external jugular vein was used as a conduit to repair the gap between the two ends of the sciatic nerve. Diabetes was induced in the transected + diabetes mellitus (T+DM), the transected + diabetes mellitus + Garcinia kola (T+DM+GK), and the transected + diabetes mellitus + Curcumin (T+DM+Cur) groups except for the sham group. A dose of 300 mg/kg/day of curcumin dissolved in olive oil was administered to the T+DM+Cur group (via oral gavage every day for 28 days) and 200 mg/kg/day of Garcinia kola to the T+DM+GK group (via oral gavage every day for seven days). All animals were sacrificed after three months. Stereological analysis and functional and microscopic evaluations were done to evaluate the sciatic nerve regeneration and function. In the T+DM+GK and the sham groups, the number of axons increased. A slight improvement in the axonal area in the T+DM+Cur and the sham groups was also observed, and an increase in the myelin sheath thickness was found in the T+DM+GK and the sham group. When the SFI test results were evaluated, it was seen that GK had a stronger effect than curcumin in terms of functional regeneration. Additionally, no significant difference was observed between T+DM and Cont groups when the electrophysiological results were examined. The study showed GK's efficiency in treating diabetic peripheral nerve regeneration.&#xD."

This in vitro study assessed laser ablation with Indocyanine Green (ICG) compared to aPDT using Methylene Blue (MB) and Curcumin (CUR) photosensitizers for reducing E. coli biofilms and inducing oxidative damage in root canals. Methods Standardized bovine upper incisor roots (n = 100) were contaminated with E. coli for 10 days to form biofilms. Groups included ICG 0.05% activated by infrared diode laser, CUR 0.05% activated by blue LED, MB 0.01% activated by red laser, sterile saline (NC), and 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (PC). Root canal samples were collected pre- and post-treatment, plated on BHI agar for CFU/mL counting. Oxidative damage was assessed using TBARS and carbonylated protein methods. Percentage reduction data underwent two-way ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls test, Kruskal-Wallis, and Dunn's tests for CFU reduction, and one-way ANOVA (p < 0.05) for oxidative damage. Results No statistical differences were found among groups for E. coli reduction. All groups had higher reduction than NC and lower reduction than PC (p < 0.05). ICG and CUR showed higher oxidative damage than MB and controls in protein carbonyl analyses. In TBARS analysis, ICG exhibited the greatest oxidative damage, statistically higher than other photosensitizers, negative, and positive controls. Conclusion There was no difference between laser ablation with ICG and aPDT with CUR and MB, which were less effective in bacterial reduction than NaOCl. However, ICG-induced higher oxidative damage in Gram-negative bacteria, suggesting its potential as an adjunctive therapy in root canal procedures."

      "abstract": "The use of mouthwash is a practical approach to decreasing bacteria during orthodontic treatment. This study aimed to investigate the antibacterial effect of 0.2% curcumin mouthwash on Streptococcus mutans in individuals undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment. For this double-blinded clinical study, 22 orthodontic patients aged 15 years or older with no systemic or periodontal diseases were selected and randomly divided into 2 groups of 11 individuals. One group received 0.2% curcumin mouthwash (intervention), while the other group received 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash (control) to use twice daily. Orthodontic elastics were collected from the patients' mouth immediately before the first use of the mouthwash, immediately after the first use, and after 20 days of mouthwash use. The elastics were stored in normal saline, and the samples were transferred to a microbiology laboratory for serial dilution, plating, and incubation. After 48 hours, the number of colony-forming units (CFUs) of S mutans were counted and compared. The Friedman and Wilcoxon tests were used for statistical analysis of intragroup data, while the Mann-Whitney U test was used for intergroup comparisons. A difference of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Both the curcumin and chlorhexidine groups demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in CFUs of S mutans immediately after the initial use as well as after 20 days' use (P < 0.05). After the first use, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the reduction of CFUs (P = 0.071). However, after 20 consecutive days of mouthwash use, the curcumin group had a significantly greater decrease in CFUs of S mutans than the chlorhexidine group (P < 0.001). Both chlorhexidine and curcumin mouthwashes significantly reduced the number of S mutans colonies when used regularly. The results of the present study suggest that curcumin herbal mouthwash is a superior choice to chlorhexidine for orthodontic patients due to its long-term antibacterial properties.",

For this, 24 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups-control, sham, diabetic, and diabetic + curcumin groups. The control group received no treatment, and 50 mg/kg streptozotocin was administered to the rats in the diabetic and diabetic + curcumin groups received 50 mg/kg streptozotocin. Once diabetes had been established, 100 mg/kg of curcumin was administered intraperitoneally to rats in the diabetic + curcumin group for a period of 21 days. Thesham group was administeredintraperitoneal ethanol and isotonic sodium chloride solution. At the ends of the experiment,tissues were subjected to histological and immunohistochemical examination to ascertain the localization of GLP-1R. Additionally, RT-PCR was employed to determine the levels of GLP-1R gene expression.The histological examinations revealed that the tissue samples from the control and sham groups exhibited a normal histological structure. In contrasr, the diabetic group displayed a range of degenerative changes, including enlargement of the sinusoidal wall enlargement and vacuolization of the hepatocytes. Furthermore, these degenerative findings were mitigated in the diabetic + curcumin group. In the immunohistochemical examinations, the majority of hepatocytes surrounding the vena centralis, as well as some endothelial, and some Kupffer cells,exhibited positively for GLP-1R. The diabetic group exhibited reduced immunoreactivity, while the diabetic + curcumin group demonstrated elevated immunoreactivity compared to the diabetes group. With regard to the molecular analysis, the mean expression level was observed to be higher in the diabetes + curcumin group. However, no significant difference in GLP-1R gene expression was identified between the groups. In conclusion, the administration of curcumin was observed to enhance GLP-1R expression in the liver of the rats with diabetes. Given that GLP-1R is a targets for diabetes treatment, curcumin can be used as a viable therapeutic agent for treating diabetes and alleviating its complications.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Autophagy is also essential for both male and female infertility since it controls the development of germ cells and reproductive organs. This study aimed to investigate the effects of taurine and curcumin on the expression of genes related to autophagy in acrylamide-treated mice. METHODS: In 2022, this experimental study was conducted at the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Stem Cells Technology Research Centre. Forty-eight mice were randomly assigned to eight groups (control, curcumin 200 mg/Kg, taurine 150 mg/Kg, acrylamide 50 mg/Kg, acrylamide+curcumin 100 mg/Kg, acrylamide+curcumin 200, acrylamide+taurine 75 mg/Kg, acrylamide+taurine 150 mg/Kg). Finally, oocyte characteristics and gene expression were determined in each group using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) by SPSS 25 and GraphPad 9, respectively. P<0.05 was conducted statistically significant. RESULTS: A significant decrease was observed in several oocytes in the acrylamide group compared to the control group (P<0.001). The expression levels of light chain 3 (LC3), autophagy-related gene (ATG)12, ATG5, and Beclin1 significantly increased in the acrylamide compared to the control group. A significant increase in the number of oocytes was observed in the taurine group compared to the control. The expression levels of LC3, ATG12, ATG5, and Beclin1 significantly decreased in the acrylamide+taurine (150 mg/Kg) compared to the acrylamide group. CONCLUSION: The acrylamide negatively impacts oocyte viability and causes the higher expression of autophagy-related genes. Taurine may encourage the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes by removing autophagic obstruction, potentially accelerating autophagy and protecting against oxidative stress. Taurine is more effective than curcumin at reducing the harmful effects of acrylamide. As a result, taurine can be proposed as a potential treatment drug for acrylamide-induced infertility.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC), as a high-incidence malignancy, continues to present significant challenges in prevention, screening, and treatment. Curcumin (Cur) exhibits notable anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties. Despite its poor solubility in water and low bioavailability, high concentrations of Cur are detected in the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration, suggesting that it may directly interact with the gut microbiota and exert regulatory effects. This study aims to explore the mechanisms by which Cur improves CRC by modulating gut microbiota. Firstly, we evaluated the effect of Cur on CRC cell viability in vitro using the MTT assay, and the results showed a significant inhibitory effect on CRC cell growth. The IC50 values for Cur in CT26 and RKO cells were 23.52 μM, 16.11 μM, and 13.62 μM at 24, 48, and 72 hours, respectively, and 26.3 μM, 16.52 μM, and 14.22 μM at 24, 48, and 72 hours, respectively. Cur induced apoptosis and caused G2 phase cell cycle arrest in tumor cells. Subsequently, we established a CRC mouse model. Oral administration of Cur at 15 mg kg-1 and 30 mg kg-1 inhibited CRC progression, as evidenced by reduced tumor volume, histological analysis, immunohistochemistry, and an increased number of CD8+ T cells infiltrating the tumors. Ferroptosis in tumor cells was also observed. Cur partially restored the gut microbiota of CRC mice, altering the abundance and diversity of the gut microbiota and affecting serum metabolite distribution, with significant increases in the abundance of SCFA-producing microbes such as Lactobacillus and Kineothrix. To verify causality, we designed a fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiment. Compared with CRC mice, the fecal microbiota from Cur-treated mice significantly alleviated CRC symptoms, including slowed tumor growth, enhanced CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration, and induced ferroptosis in tumor cells. Additionally, when gut microbiota was depleted with antibiotics, Cur's antitumor effects disappeared, suggesting that Cur mitigates CRC in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying CRC and propose novel therapeutic interventions, emphasizing the interaction between gut microbiota and immune responses within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME)."

METHODS: Forty patients of bilateral mild to moderate DED were randomized in two groups - group A (topical carboxy methyl cellulose QID + oral placebo) and group B (topical carboxy methyl cellulose QID + oral bio-enhanced curcumin). The objective parameters of DED were quantified at baseline and compared at 3 months follow-up. RESULTS: At three months follow-up, there was significant improvement in curcumin group in terms of Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) score (P = 0.002), tear meniscus height (TMH) (P = 0.002), tear volume (P = 0.006), tear break-up time (TBUT) (P < 0.001), non-invasive break-up time (NIBUT) (P = 0.026), lipid layer thickness (LLT) (P = 0.01), and decrease in bulbar redness (P = 0.002). There was no significant improvement in limbal redness (P = 0.097), corneal-staining score (P = 0.93), and Schirmer's test (P = 0.42). Mild adverse drug reaction was observed in three cases of the curcumin group and one case of group A. CONCLUSIONS: Oral bio-enhanced curcumin is a safe and effective treatment modality in cases of mild to moderate DED. It effectively improves the tear film stability, LLT, and TMH and reduces the bulbar redness."

      "abstract": "The use of natural compounds as effective therapeutic agents is an expanding area of health and disease research. Curcumin, a bioactive component derived from the rhizome of the turmeric plant (Curcuma longa L.), has been primarily used in culinary applications for several centuries, but now its potential health benefits are the focus of growing scientific research. Interestingly, some studies have found that curcumin has antitumorigenic effects due to its ability to influence the tumor microenvironment and possibly promote immune system response by modulating specific signaling pathways in immune cells. The interaction of curcumin with immune cells in the field of cancer chemoprevention is a complex area of research. It has been suggested that curcumin might promote T cell recruitment, reduce neutrophil and macrophage accumulation in the tumor microenvironment, and prevent the conversion of infiltrating lymphocytes into immunosuppressive subpopulations. Thus, its possible mechanisms of action also include a shift of the immune balance toward activation by reversing the prevalence of immunosuppressive cells. With innovations and improvements in our understanding of the potential benefits of curcumin on immune cells in cancer prevention and treatment, it is important to have an overview of current findings. Therefore, in this study, we aim to provide a review of the latest discoveries regarding curcumin in the field of cancer and immune cell research."

These characteristics have made it a key component in managing inflammatory and ulcerative conditions like oral mucositis (OM). This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various pharmaceutical formulations of C. longa or curcumin in reducing the OM severity, incidence and associated pain in patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for cancer. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, registered in PROSPERO (#CRD42024504111). Searches were performed in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Studies comparing C. longa or curcumin with placebo in cancer patients experiencing oral mucositis, reporting outcomes such as the World Health Organization Oral Mucositis Grading Scale, pain scores (visual analogue scale), or OM incidence were included. Risk ratios and weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using fixed- or random-effects models. RESULTS: Six studies with 159 patients (mean age ∼50 years, 40% women) were included. C. longa extracts, curcumin, or nanocurcumin were administered in capsules, mouthwash, or gel formulations. The pooled analysis showed significant reductions in WHO scores and oral pain compared to placebo. OM incidence decreased by 6% overall, with a notable 37%-reduction observed in patients using curcumin-containing mouthwash during radiotherapy alone. Subgroup analyses revealed consistent benefits across all oncological treatments. CONCLUSION: C. longa, curcumin, or nanocurcumin in various formulations, effectively reduce OM severity and pain while curcumin-containing mouthwash reduced OM incidence in cancer patients undergoing treatment.

This study combined bioinformatics, molecular docking, and experimental assays to tackle this challenge. We identified 166 ovarian cancer-related genes, with MYC standing out as a key target. Analysis of MYC mutations revealed prevalent alterations, though no significant survival differences were observed in patients with or without the mutations. Molecular docking pinpointed compound B155 as a promising MYC inhibitor. A preliminary cytotoxicity assay revealed compound B155's notable activity, with an 87.19 % inhibition of cell viability at 50 μM. Most of the other curcumin analogues only caused more than 50 % inhibition at the same concentration. This result suggests alternative mechanisms of action, possibly antioxidant effects, warranting further exploration. In summary, this study unveiled MYC as a prime target for ovarian cancer treatment, with curcumin analogues like B155 showing potential. Nonetheless, the complex factors affecting cytotoxicity underscore the need for deeper investigation into these compounds' mechanisms in ovarian cancer cells."

Several therapeutic methods have been recommended for PCOS including lifestyle modification, insulin sensitizer (metformin), ovulation inducers (letrozole, clomiphene citrate), hormonal pills, and surgical intervention (ovarian drilling and oophorectomy); however, these treatment modalities often cause adverse effects. Currently, phytochemicals and plant extracts have been recommended for PCOS. Among these, few phytochemicals and their formulations, curcumin (CUR) (a bioactive polyphenol from Curcuma longa), has emerged as a promising complementary PCOS therapy due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, insulin-sensitizing, and ovulation inducing properties. However, CUR's clinical application is hindered by poor solubility and bioavailability. In this review, we summarize and discuss various formulations of CUR and combination therapies that have demonstrated potential in treating PCOS in animal models.",

      "abstract": "About 70% of spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience neuropathic pain (NP), posing an important medical challenge. Painkillers are used to manage pain today and often have undesirable side effects. Curcumin's antioxidant properties may help alleviate NP following SCI (NP-SCI). We decided to study curcumin's effects on NP-SCI for the first time. Male Wistar rats were divided into five groups (n = 8): Control (no injury/no treatment), Sham (laminectomy), SCI (spinal cord compression at T11-T12 using a clip), Curcumin100 and Curcumin200 (Curcumin at 100 and 200 mg/kg administered 30 min after SCI for 10days). Motor function, allodynia, and hyperalgesia were assessed using the BBB scale, acetone, and tail-flick until six weeks after SCI. H&E staining for assaying cavity, western blot for measuring GAD65 and GABA-A receptors, and biochemical kits for assaying SOD, catalase, total antioxidant capacity, and MDA were used. PRISM software analyzed data. Results showed significant improvements in motion, allodynia, hyperalgesia, cavity, urinary retention (P < 0.0001), and weight in curcumin treatments. There was also a reduction in MDA, with increasing GABA-A receptors, GAD65, and antioxidants in them. Findings suggest curcumin may provide good analgesic effects through its antioxidants, and extensive studies are needed to confirm it as a treatment for NP-SCI in the clinic.

      "abstract": "Curcumin (CUR) has gained considerable attention in oncology due to its potent anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. However, its clinical utility was significantly hindered by low bioavailability and rapid metabolic degradation. This work designed a magnetic α-Fe2O3/Fe3O4 heterogeneous nanorod prepared via a urea hydrolysis-calcination process for curcumin delivery. The nanorods were modified with hyaluronic acid (HA), providing a stable matrix for curcumin encapsulation. The zeta potential of α-Fe2O3/Fe3O4/HA/CUR was -3.94 mV, the saturation magnetization was 7.82 emu·g-1, the encapsulation rate and drug loading rate were 10.53 % and 29.64 % respectively. At pH 5.4, 6.5, and 7.4, the release rates were 44.8 %, 40.2 %, and 39.3 %, respectively. Kinetic modeling indicated that release profiles followed the Weibull kinetic model, with an R2 value greater than 0.98. The α-Fe2O3/Fe3O4/HA/CUR exhibited excellent magnetic responsiveness, demonstrating a significant inhibitory effect on human liver cancer (HepG2) cells (inhibition rate greater than 60 %) under a magnetic field. Moreover, they substantially reduced the cytotoxicity of curcumin on normal human (LO2) cells. The α-Fe2O3/Fe3O4/HA/CUR inhibited migration and proliferation of HepG2 cells, induced apoptosis via the Caspase pathway, and synergistically suppressed tumor cell development through ferroptosis. The drug release from the α-Fe2O3/Fe3O4/HA/CUR was stable, significantly enhancing the bioavailability of curcumin. This provided a promising strategy for improving the bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs and enhancing liver cancer treatment outcomes."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Curcumin, a natural active compound derived from plants, is widely used as a pigment across the globe. Research has demonstrated that curcumin possesses neuroprotective properties in spinal cord injuries (SCIs); however, its specific mechanisms of action remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying curcumin's therapeutic effects in SCI. METHODS: We screened the targets of curcumin in the treatment of spinal cord injury using network pharmacology across a variety of public databases. The interaction between the compound and the target was analyzed through bioinformatics analysis, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation. Finally, the prediction results were verified by simulating spinal cord injury through oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) injury in PC12 cells. RESULTS: Initial screening indicated 13 core targets involved in mitigating SCI. Curcumin may regulate the HIF pathway, immune cells, inflammation, oxidative stress, and other processes. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and caspase 3 (CASP3) were identified as key targets of curcumin in SCI regulation. Molecular docking results demonstrated that curcumin exhibited favorable affinity with the core targets, with MMP9 showing the highest binding affinity (-8.76 kcal/mol). Further studies confirmed that curcumin stably binds with MMP9, and the binding site was located at residues 220-225. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay results showed that curcumin exerted a good therapeutic effect. Western blot results showed that curcumin inhibited the expression of MMP9 protein but had no significant effect on the expression of TNF-α. CONCLUSION: Curcumin exerts its effects on SCI through multiple targets and pathways. Its specific mechanisms involve the inhibition of inflammation, prevention of apoptosis and ferroptosis, and promotion of neuronal repair. MMP9 may be a key target mediating curcumin's protective effects against SCI. These findings provide scientific evidence for further research and development of drugs."

Clinical periodontal parameters such as probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and bleeding on probing (BOP) were assessed to evaluate the efficacy of the treatments. Methods: Thirty patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), a history of poor glycemic control, and chronic periodontitis were enrolled in this clinical and microbiological split-mouth study. After conventional periodontal treatment, scaling, and root planing, the most severe sites on the premolar or molar teeth with periodontal pockets measuring ≥5 mm were selected and randomly divided into two groups: the C. longa extract gel group (with a concentration of 25 µg/g) and the photodynamic group (C. longa extract gel 25 µg/g irradiated with blue light energy density = 16.8 J/cm2 for 120 s). All teeth were examined for clinical periodontal parameters data (PD, CAL, plaque index [PI], and BOP) and microbiological data (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and total bacteria), measured using TaqMan Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction, at weeks 0, 1, 2, and 12. The Mann-Whitney U test was utilized to compare clinical outcomes between groups, while the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test at a 95% confidence level was employed to analyze the amount of periodontal pathogens within the same group. Results: After the 12-week follow-up period, significant improvements were observed in all clinical parameters across both groups. However, the reduction in both CAL and BOP was significantly higher in the photodynamic group compared to the curcumin gel alone group, indicating enhanced periodontal health outcomes in the former. Microbiologically, both groups exhibited a decrease in total bacterial count and a reduction in periodontopathic bacteria. Importantly, the photodynamic group demonstrated a significant decrease in F. nucleatum and P. intermedia counts, key pathogens associated with periodontal disease progression. This suggests that photodynamic therapy (PDT), when used with curcumin gel, not only improves clinical parameters but also promotes a favorable shift in the periodontal microbial profile. Conclusion: Our findings highlight that PDT with curcumin gel as a photosensitizer (PS) is more effective than curcumin gel alone in achieving clinical attachment gain, reducing gingival inflammation, and suppressing specific periodontal pathogens. This combined therapy approach holds promise for managing periodontal disease by addressing both clinical symptoms and microbial factors."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is a chronic gynecological disorder characterized by significant pain and reduced quality of life (QOL). Current treatments, such as dienogest, are not fully effective, prompting the investigation of curcumin as a potential adjunct therapy. Although curcumin has demonstrated promise in preclinical studies, its clinical efficacy in endometriosis, particularly in combination with standard therapies like dienogest, remains underexplored. PURPOSE: This is the first study aimed to evaluate the add-on effect of curcumin in combination with dienogest on pain relief, QOL, and sexual function in women with endometriosis. STUDY DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to compare the efficacy of curcumin combined with dienogest versus dienogest alone with a placebo. METHODS: Eighty-six women aged 18-45 with stage 2-3 pelvic endometriosis and moderate to severe pain (visual analogue scale (VAS) ≥ 4) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either nanocurcumin soft gel capsules (80 mg/day) or a placebo, along with dienogest (2 mg/day), for 8 weeks. Outcomes were assessed using adjusted mean differences (aMD) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: After 8 weeks, the curcumin and dienogest group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in pain scores compared to the placebo group: dysmenorrhea (aMD: -1.55, 95 %CI: -2.04 to -1.06; p < 0.001), dyspareunia (aMD: -0.93, 95 %CI: -1.37 to -0.49; p < 0.001), chronic pelvic pain (aMD: -1.55, 95 %CI: -2.04 to -1.06; p < 0.001), and dyschezia (aMD: -0.30, 95 %CI: -0.58 to -0.03; p = 0.030). Additional benefits were observed in QOL and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) scores, except for the orgasm domain. Differences in endometrioma size were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The combination of curcumin and dienogest significantly reduced pain and improved QOL and sexual function in women with endometriosis, suggesting curcumin as an effective adjunct therapy.",

      "abstract": "Curcumin (CUR) exhibits antimicrobial properties but is hindered by chemical instability, limiting its direct application. This study evaluated the efficacy of curcumin nanoemulsions (CUR-NE) in reducing pathogenic microorganisms on cantaloupe rind surfaces. Two CUR-NE formulations, 1CUR-NE (0.05% CUR, w/w) and 2CUR-NE (0.10% CUR, w/w), were prepared by mixing CUR with medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil (3% w/w), polysorbate 80 (2% w/w), and polyethylene glycol (10% w/w), followed by a 15-min ultrasound treatment (175 W). The antimicrobial effects were assessed against Listeria innocua B-33016, Escherichia coli ATCC25922, aerobic bacteria, and yeast and mold. Inoculated cantaloupe surfaces were treated with CUR-NE, and microbial counts were analyzed on days 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. The viscosity of 1CUR-NE and 2CUR-NE was 0.0030 ± 0.0001 Pa s and 0.0027 ± 0.0006 Pa s, with droplet sizes of 122.47 ± 3.06 nm and 137.67 ± 1.36 nm, respectively. Treatment with 2CUR-NE significantly reduced L. innocua growth on day 6 (2.50 ± 1.00 log CFU/cm2), with E. coli showing significant reductions on days 6 (1.55 ± 0.40 log CFU/cm2), 9 (1.91 ± 0.36 log CFU/cm2), and 12 (0.72 ± 0.26 log CFU/cm2). Scanning electron microscopy revealed a substantial decrease in microbial load after treatment. The results suggest that CUR-NE, particularly 2CUR-NE, effectively reduces pathogenic contamination on cantaloupe and offers a potential alternative to synthetic antimicrobial agents in food safety applications. Further studies are needed to explore the long-term efficacy and broader applications of CUR-NE in food systems.",

      "abstract": "Atrazine (ATR), a widely used herbicide, poses significant environmental and health risks due to its high solubility and adsorption in soil. ATR exposure can lead to nephrotoxicity in humans and animals. Curcumin (Cur), an active compound in Curcuma species, is renowned for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, with potential to mitigate chronic disease risks. We hypothesized that the addition of Cur could alleviate renal impairment associated with ATR exposure and carried out experiments using mice as subjects. This study investigates whether Cur can attenuate ATR-induced nephrotoxicity in mice by modulating mitophagy and apoptotic pathways. Our findings illustrate that consumption with Cur attenuates nephrotoxicity induced by ATR, as evidenced by lowered serum concentrations of uric acid (UA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (CRE), established biomarkers of renal injury. Moreover, Curcumin enhances renal antioxidant defense mechanisms in ATR-exposed mice, as indicated by elevated levels of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), alongside reduced levels of malondialdehyde (MDA). Histopathological and electron microscopy analyses further corroborate these findings, showing reduced organelle damage, particularly mitochondrial ridge breakage and vacuolization, and increased autophagic lysosomes. Cur further enhances PINK1/Parkin-mediated autophagy, as evidenced by elevated levels of PINK1, Parkin, LC3BII, and P62 compared to ATR-treated mice. Moreover, Cur mitigates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, indicated by the down-regulation of apoptosis-related genes (Cytochrome C (Cyto-C), Caspase3, Caspase9) and the pro-apoptotic marker (Bax), along with the up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic marker (Bcl-2) at both transcriptional and translational levels compared to ATR-treated mice. In summary, Cur demonstrates nephroprotective properties against ATR-induced injury through the enhancement of mitochondrial autophagy and display of anti-apoptotic actions, underscoring its curative potency as a treatment for nephrotoxicity caused by ATR.",

It is known that curcumin has a strong neuroprotective potential. This experimental study was designed to examine the anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective effects of curcumin administered alone and in combination with L-DOPA in the hippocampus as well as behavioral symptoms in rotenone-induced PD model. Forty-two 4-month-old adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups as follows: Control, Curcumin, Rotenone, Rotenone plus curcumin, Rotenone plus L-DOPA and Rotenone plus curcumin plus L-DOPA. Control group received vehicles, curcumin group received curcumin (200 mg kg-1, daily for 35 days), rotenone group received rotenone (2 mg kg-1, daily for 35 days), and test groups received curcumin or L-DOPA (10 mg kg-1, daily for the last 15 days) or their combination in addition the rotenone. Pole, sucrose preference, open field, elevated plus maze, and Morris water maze tests were performed after treatment. Molecular and biochemical analyses were performed in the hippocampus tissue and serum samples. Rotenone injection caused impairments in motor activity, depressive-like behavior, and learning and memory functions. Rotenone also increased the expressions of α-synuclein, caspase 3, NF-κB, and decreased the expressions of parkin and BDNF in the hippocampus. However, especially curcumin and L-DOPA combined treatment normalized all these impaired molecular and behavioral variables. In conclusion, curcumin may exert beneficial effects in treatment strategies for PD-related hippocampal effects, especially when added to L-DOPA therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation is a major environmental factor contributing to skin damage via DNA damage, oxidative stress, inflammation, and collagen degradation. It penetrates the epidermis, disrupts DNA integrity, and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), activating pro-inflammatory pathways such as NF-κB and AP-1, and inducing matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). These processes lead to structural skin changes, inflammation, and pigmentation disorders like melasma. Cumulative DNA damage from UVB also drives photocarcinogenesis, with nearly 90% of melanomas associated with UV radiation (UVR). Despite clinical interventions like phototherapy and antioxidants, effective treatments for UVB-induced damage remain limited due to side effects and efficacy issues. METHODS: This study investigates the protective effects of curcumin on UVB-induced skin damage using a mouse UVB irradiation model and HaCaT cells exposed to UVB in vitro. Skin damage was assessed through histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses. Cellular functional changes were evaluated using assays for cell viability, mitochondrial function, ROS levels, and apoptosis. Transcriptomic analysis was employed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying curcumin's protective effects on HaCaT cells post-UVB exposure. This integrated approach provides a comprehensive understanding of curcumin's molecular-level protection against UVB-induced skin damage. RESULTS: Curcumin significantly alleviated UVB-induced skin lesions and inflammation in vivo. In vitro, it mitigated UVB-induced HaCaT cell damage, enhancing viability while reducing apoptosis and ROS levels. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that curcumin upregulated YAP signaling and mitochondrial autophagy while suppressing IL-18 expression. CONCLUSION: Curcumin treatment markedly improved UVB-induced skin lesions and reduced epidermal inflammation and thickness in vivo. In vitro, curcumin intervention alleviated UVB-induced HaCaT cell damage, including reduced viability, increased apoptosis, elevated ROS and DNA damage, and enhanced inflammatory responses. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that curcumin upregulated the YAP signaling pathway and mitochondrial autophagy while inhibiting the IL-18 pathway. Further studies revealed that curcumin directly interacts with YAP1, promoting mitochondrial autophagy, an effect blocked by the YAP1 inhibitor Verteporfin. Additionally, curcumin enhances mitochondrial function through YAP1, maintaining mitochondrial integrity and preventing the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and mitochondrial ROS (mtROS), thereby suppressing NLRP3/IL-18 pathway activation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oligo-asthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) is one of the causes of male subinfertility, and one of the treatment solutions is sperm cryopreservation. However, during the freezing-thawing process, sperm parameters decrease. It is important to find compounds that can prevent the reduction of sperm parameters. The aim of this study is to reduce male infertility through sperm preservation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, thirty OAT patients meeting the inclusion criteria were selected for the current research. Initially, the patients were studied by karyotyping, and all of them were normal 46 XY. After that, sperm samples were taken from them. Sperm parameters such as viability, concentration, motility and percentage of abnormal morphology were determined before cryopreservation. Then, the samples were divided into four aliquots and placed in cryopreservation medium supplemented with different concentrations of curcumin (0, 15, 20, and 25 μM). These samples were placed in a nitrogen tank. After 7 days, the samples were thawed, and sperm parameters were measured. In the next step, the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were measured by kits. Finally, after RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, the expression levels of the BAD, B-cell lymphoma-extra large (BCL-XL) and microRNA-21 (MIR-21) genes were investigated using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Curcumin (20 μM) conserved OAT sperm motility after the freezing-thawing process. Additionally, this concentration of curcumin decreased MDA and improved SOD and GPx activities in cryopreserved sperm. The results of gene expression analysis showed downregulation of BAD and overexpression of both BCL-XL and MIR-21 in 20 μM curcumin-treated sperm after the freezing-thawing process. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that adding appropriate antioxidants to the sperm freezing medium can greatly reduce the destructive effects of oxidative stress and improve sperm motility."

When associated with cancer, it correlates with poorer clinical outcomes. Cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, prevalent globally and in Brazil, are associated with a greater nutritional risk. Early detection and intervention for nutritional risks are critical in this population. Recent studies on turmeric/curcumin have demonstrated beneficial effects in cancer patients. Specifically, curcumin have shown promise in reducing muscle depletion, oxidative stress, and improving strength and fatigue, factors related to sarcopenia. This review aims to elucidate sarcopenia and sarcopenia secondary to cancer, emphasizing nutritional management and the role of curcumin supplementation. Effective cancer management, whether with or without sarcopenia, demands comprehensive public health strategies and multimodal interventions within healthcare institutions. Nutrition is pivotal across the cancer care journey, encompassing screening, guidance, and provision of nutrients that support maintaining or recovering body composition. Curcumin supplementation emerges as a potential adjuvant to the standard cancer treatment and sarcopenia management. Nevertheless, further clinical studies are warranted to substantiate these findings.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) is accompanied by abnormal initiation and development of primordial follicles. Reporting that curcumin can protect the ovarian reserve, we used rats as a model to explore the regulatory mechanism of curcumin on primordial follicle priming. OBJECTIVE: Curcumin restores the ovarian microenvironment of DOR model rats by AMPK/ SIRT 1 signaling pathway, thus regulating the initiation of primordial follicles. METHODS: The study used the ovaries of 3-day-old female rats, after replicating the DOR model by triptolide (TP), then used curcumin intervention for 3 days. Histomorphological analysis was counted by H & E staining; ELISA test was used to count ovarian hormone [follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) / luteinizing hormone (LH) ratio and estradiol (E2)] concentration in the culture supernatant. Spectrophotometric measurement was used to count of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the malondialdehyde (MDA). The protein and mRNA expression of the pathway and key indicators for follicle initiation were determined by Western Blot and Q-PCR (AMPK, SIRT 1, PTEN, PGC-1 α, and AMH). RESULTS: After curcumin treatment, the number of growing follicles increased (P < 0.05). FSH/LH ratio decreased but the content and expression of E2 and AMH increased (P < 0.05). The protein and mRNA expression of characteristic indicators of inhibiting primordial follicle initiation (PTEN) was decreased (P < 0.05). Oxidation-reduction-related SOD activity increased and the content of MDA decreased (P < 0.05), while the protein and mRNA expression of PGC- 1α increased (P < 0.05). The protein and mRNA expression of the pathway (AMPK, SIRT 1) were increased (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Curcumin restored the ovarian local oxidant-antioxidant balance and promoted primordial follicle priming through AMPK/SIRT 1 signaling pathway in the DOR model rats."

The effectiveness of current drug treatment for NP is still unsatisfactory due to its side effects, addiction and withdrawal. In recent years, researchers have begun to develop nano-drug delivery systems for the diagnosis and treatment of NP diseases. METHODS: We developed a disulfide-bonded magnetic mesoporous silica dual-drug delivery system consisting of curcumin (Cur) and a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist (CGRPi), and characterized by electron microscopy, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Zeta, specific surface area and pore size detection. At the cellular level, the biocompatibility of CGRPi@Cur@Fe3O4@mSiO2-PEG (FMCC) nanoparticles were tested by CCK-8 and dead/alive staining kit in BV2 cells; Inflammation levels and oxidative stress were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV2 neuroinflammation model. In vivo, chronic constriction injury (CCI) model was constructed, and the effect of FMCC on pain behavior of CCI mice was detected by von Frey filaments test and thermal hyperalgesia; The effects of FMCC on the anti-inflammatory and oxidative stress of CCI were determined by pathological tests (HE and ROS staining), RT-PCR and ELISA. RESULTS: FMCC had good biocompatibility and could be taken up by BV2 cells. At the cellular level, FMCC could effectively reverse oxidative stress, inflammation and CGRP expression in LPS-induced neuroinflammation model in vitro. At the animal level, the mice with CCI were administered with FMCC, which effectively reduced oxidative stress and inflammation and sustained relief of neuropathic pain. CONCLUSION: This study provides a new approach for the treatment of neuropathic pain."

They have shown significant therapeutic potential in clinical applications, such as mouth rinses, toothpastes, and localized delivery systems. The use of natural alternatives can contribute to tackling antimicrobial resistance. Among natural compounds, curcumin has gained particular attention, demonstrating robust anti-cancer, antibiotic, and anti-inflammatory activities in numerous in vivo studies, while exhibiting a favorable safety profile for the treatment of various diseases. In this study, the remedial effects of curcumin and its metabolite, tetrahydrocurcumin, on dental pulp were explored. In addition, these results were compared with our previous findings on the effects of these natural compounds on periodontal ligament and gingival epithelial cells, further broadening our understanding of their therapeutic potential in oral disease such as caries and periodontitis. METHODS: RNA sequencing was used to investigate the differentially expressed genes in dental pulp cells following treatments with curcumin and tetrahydrocurcumin. RESULTS: We show that treatment of dental pulp cells with 1 μM of curcumin or tetrahydrocurcumin is sufficient to promote Wnt signaling pathway in dental pulp cells. Curcumin treatment promotes the upregulation of cellular metabolism and enhances cellular response to stress. Our enrichment analysis shows that treatment with tetrahydrocurcumin modulates the extracellular matrix and angiogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study highlight the cytoprotective and regenerative properties of curcumin and tetrahydrocurcumin. These properties could be leveraged as a therapeutic approach to promote tissue regeneration in oral diseases."

This study explored the potential of curcumin as an adjunctive therapy in IBD, assessing its efficacy and safety through a systematic review of clinical trials to enhance treatment strategies and outcomes. METHODS: To identify placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials on curcumin treatment in IBD, databases such as Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar were searched till May 2024. Inclusion criteria focused on RCTs comparing curcumin with placebo in IBD patients, with data extraction and analysis conducted using established methodologies and tools for comprehensive synthesis and assessment of study findings. RESULTS: In this meta-analysis, 13 placebo-controlled RCTs on curcumin treatment in IBD were included after screening 362 records and conducting a full-text review. Most trials focused on UC patients and were published post-2010, utilizing oral curcumin with varying dosages and durations. The analysis showed curcumin's significant efficacy in achieving clinical remission and response in UC patients, with heterogeneity observed. Adverse events and withdrawal rates did not significantly differ between curcumin and placebo groups. In CD patients, curcumin did not show superiority over placebo for clinical and endoscopic remission. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight curcumin's potential as a treatment for UC but indicate inconclusive results for CD, emphasizing the need for further research. The multifaceted mechanisms of curcumin's efficacy in IBD involve anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, microbiota modulatory, and immune-regulating properties. Further research is warranted to enhance understanding and treatment efficacy. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42024567247."

However, its mechanisms, particularly through modulation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment, remain unexplored. This study aimed to elucidate how curcumin suppresses ovarian cancer progression by regulating TAM polarization. Primary TAMs isolated from ascites of ovarian cancer patients were co-cultured with SKOV3/OVCAR-3 cancer cells. Curcumin was administered at varying doses (5-80 μM) to assess its direct effects on cancer cell viability and its indirect effects via TAM modulation. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, invasion, and cytokine profiles were analyzed using CCK-8, flow cytometry, RT-PCR, Western blot, and functional assays. High-dose curcumin (40-80 μM) directly inhibited cancer cell proliferation. In contrast, low-dose curcumin (5-20 μM) suppressed TAM-induced malignant behaviors: it reduced M2 polarization (CD206⁺ TAMs decreased by 54.89% to 32.14%, p < 0.01) while increasing M1-associated cytokines (IL-12↑, IL-1β↑) and decreasing M2 markers (IL-10↓, TGF-β↓). TAM-conditioned medium primed with 20 μM curcumin significantly attenuated cancer cell migration (scratch closure: 65% vs. 85% in TAM-only group, p < 0.01), invasion, and EMT (E-cadherin↑, N-cadherin↓, Vimentin↓). Our study uncovered the mechanism of the anti-tumor effect of curcumin in low doses related to the regulation of TAMs, which might provide novel insight into the treatment of ovarian cancer.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Overactive neutrophilic inflammation causes damage to the airways and death in people with cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene. Reducing the impact of inflammation is therefore a major concern in CF. Evidence indicates that dysfunctional NRF2 signaling in CF individuals may impair their ability to regulate their oxidative and inflammatory responses, although the role of NRF2 in neutrophil-dominated inflammation and tissue damage associated with CF has not been determined. Therefore, we examined whether curcumin, an activator of NRF2, might provide a beneficial effect in the context of CF. METHODS: Combining Cftr-depleted zebrafish as an innovative biomedical model with CF patient-derived airway organoids (AOs), we aimed to understand how NRF2 dysfunction leads to abnormal inflammatory status and tissue remodeling and determine the effects of curcumin in reducing inflammation and tissue damage in CF. RESULTS: We demonstrate that NFR2 is instrumental in regulating neutrophilic inflammation and repair processes in vivo, thereby preventing inflammatory damage. Importantly, curcumin treatment restores NRF2 activity in both CF zebrafish and AOs. Curcumin reduces neutrophilic inflammation in CF context, by rebalancing the production of epithelial ROS and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, curcumin improves tissue repair by reducing CF-associated fibrosis. Our findings demonstrate that curcumin prevents CF-mediated inflammation via activating the NRF2 pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights the protective role of NRF2 in limiting inflammation and injury and show that therapeutic strategies to normalize NRF2 activity, using curcumin or others NRF2 activators, might simultaneously reduce airway inflammation and damage in CF.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cell-free therapy utilizes components such as secretomes and exosomes whose properties depend on the cellular environment. This study investigates how altering the microenvironment of human Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (hWJ-MSCs) with curcumin and quinine affects exosome content, potentially influencing ACE2 expression in Vero and Caco-2 cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: hWJ-MSCs were divided into groups treated with curcumin, quinine, DMSO or culture medium only. Secretomes and exosomes were isolated and analyzed, with exosomes characterized by CD63 marker, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Exosome uptake by Vero and Caco-2 cells was monitored over time, and ACE2 expression was assessed by immunocytochemistry (ICC) and Western blotting. The results of this study demonstrated that exosomes averaged 114.3 nm in size and contained 88 miRNAs, with significant miRNA reductions in exosomes treated with curcumin and quinine. Vero and Caco-2 cells internalized these exosomes within 2.5 h and showed a significant decrease in ACE2 expression when treated with curcumin- or quinine-treated exosomes. This effect was associated with changes in miRNA, including miR-125b-5p in treated exosomes. Exosomes modified with curcumin or quinine significantly downregulated ACE2 expression, suggesting that these compounds may affect miRNA expression or loading, thereby affecting ACE2 protein expression. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the therapeutic potential of bioactive compounds in modulating ACE2 through exosome-carried biomolecules. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for condition associated with ACE2 dysregulation and warrant further investigation into molecular mechanism involved.",

While curcumin has been reported to possess anti-cancer properties, how it exerts its anti-neoplastic effect on ovarian cancer cells remains to be explored. We here characterized the fate of human ovarian cancer cell lines HO8910 and OVCAR3 treated with curcumin. Cell proliferation, cell death, mitochondrial function, oxidative damage and tumor formation in nude mice were examined. Significant inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis were observed in ovarian cells treated with curcumin. The cancer cells exhibit cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, mitochondrial accumulation, mitochondrial oxidative stress and high level of DNA damage after curcumin treatment. This effect of curcumin is independent of the BRCA mutation status. Curcumin-induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosis were effectively attenuated by the application of antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), suggesting that curcumin exerts its anti-cancer effect by inflicting oxidative stress. Curcumin applied at 200 mg/kg intraperitoneal infusion daily also inhibited the growth, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial accumulation of tumor xenografts in vivo. Together, the results indicate that curcumin can exert its anti-tumor effect via inducing mitochondrial dysfunction-associated oxidative DNA damage and can be potentially used in combination with other DNA repair-interfering therapeutics, such as PARP inhibitor, in the treatment of ovarian cancer.",

      "abstract": "Psoriasis, a prevalent immunoinflammatory skin condition, is characterized by abnormal skin thickening, which complicates traditional topical drug delivery and hinders drug penetration. Our goal is to enhance the efficacy of psoriasis treatment by developing a transdermal drug formulation. Microneedles (MNs) can improve treatment outcomes by increasing the absorption of topical medications through skin penetration. Curcumin (Cur), a natural anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory small molecule with water-insoluble properties, shows promise for psoriasis relief. In this research, three Cur nano-formulations (NFs) were screened and prepared using antisolvent and ethanol injection methods, with one being dispersed into hyaluronic acid (HA) dissolving MNs. A transdermal nano-MNs delivery system was constructed using a double-layer centrifugation technique. This co-delivery system overcame Cur's solubility issues, poor absorption, and instability, allowing targeted and efficient delivery of Cur-NFs to the skin without being hindered by the skin barrier. In vitro studies demonstrated that Cur-NF dissolving MNs possess adequate mechanical properties for skin implantation, exhibit rapid dissolution, and achieve an effective drug release rate of 73 % within 6 h. Pharmacodynamic evaluations demonstrated that the MNs system effectively ameliorated key psoriatic skin manifestations. Notably, MNs treatment significantly reduced the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score from 12.0 ± 0.0 (model group) to 4.7 ± 0.5 (p < 0.05), alongside a marked suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-17, IL-22, and IL-23, compared to untreated psoriatic controls. Therefore, the composite dissolving MNs delivery system loaded with Cur-NFs represents a promising approach for psoriasis treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women. Recent studies emphasize the significant role of folate metabolic pathways in cancer progression. The Reduced Folate Carrier (RFC), a folate transporter in cell membranes, plays an essential role in transporting folate receptor-dependent drugs. Curcumin, a bioactive compound with anticancer and anti-inflammatory effects, is hindered by low stability and a short half-life. Niosomes are versatile nanoparticles that can deliver both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the anticancer effects of curcumin-loaded niosomal nanoparticles, focusing on their impact on RFC, BAX, and BCL-2 gene expression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. METHODS: Curcumin-loaded noisomal nanoparticles were synthesized by the thin-film hydration method. Then, the morphology, size, and physico-chemical nanoparticles were determined by FE-SEM, DLS, and FT-IR methods, respectively. The MTT results determined the cytotoxicity of free and nano-formulated curcumin; also, the gene expression of RFC, BCL-2, and BAX was evaluated using the Real-Time PCR method. Furthermore, apoptosis and cell cycle analysis were investigated by Flow cytometry.  Results: The results of the physicochemical characteristics of the nanoparticles showed that curcumin was appropriately loaded in niosomal NPs. The MTT results showed that curcumin loaded in niosomal NPs has a higher anti-proliferative effect than free curcumin. Real-time PCR results showed increased RFC and BAX gene expression and decreased BCL-2 gene expression; this change was more significant in the treatment with nano-formulated curcumin. The apoptosis and cell cycle analysis also confirmed that free and nano-formulated curcumin induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.  Conclusion: Overall, the results suggested that curcumin loaded in niosomal nanoparticles effectively improves the anticancer effect and could be a capable approach for treating breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurological disorder primarily affecting older adults. A hallmark of this condition is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to increased oxidative stress and cellular damage. Treatment with a curcumin-selenium nanoemulsion has been shown to enhance behavioural performance and mitigate degenerative changes induced by aluminium chloride (AlCl3). This nanoemulsion also reduced the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and lowered levels of key proteins, including Aβ, p53, tau, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Additionally, it significantly decreased nitric oxide (NO) levels in the brain while enhancing the activity of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The study highlights the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of the curcumin-selenium nanoemulsion, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic option for alleviating AD induced by AlCl3. These results are further supported by improvements in the histological structure of the cortex and hippocampus, as well as enhanced immunohistochmical assessment of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Cur- Se-nanoemulsion, the current drug delivery technology, may lower the amount of amyloid-β in AD rat brain and considerably ameliorate the memory deficit that improve therapy efficacy in AD lesions.",

Although there are various approaches to the treatment of RB, satisfactory results cannot be obtained. Natural products of plant origin have shown definite therapeutic effects in the treatment of various tumors and are widely used in the study of RB. Curcumin (Cur) is closely related to the expression and activity of various regulatory proteins. In this study, the anticancer roles of the combination of curcumin with a strong chemotherapy agent such as adryamycin (Adr) were demonstrated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The human retinoblastoma cell line WERI-Rb-1 (HTB-169) was used in the study. It was determined that cytotoxicity increased in cancer cells treated with IC50 doses of Cur and Adr for 48 hours in combined applications. Differences in mRNA levels of Caspase-3, P53 and Survivin genes, which are important triggers and regulators of apoptosis in treated cells, were determined by quantitative simultaneous PCR (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: While it was determined that Cur and Adr application caused a significant increase in both Caspase-3 and P53 mRNA levels, a significant decrease was detected in the mRNA level of Survivin (p < 0.05). In this study, it was shown for the first time that Cur and Adr can exhibit anti-cancer properties by triggering the apoptosis death pathway in retinoblastoma cell lines."

Despite advancements, radiation dermatitis remains a challenge, disrupting treatment schedules and compromising patients' quality of life. Exploring herbal compounds, particularly Curcumin, has shown promise in addressing radiation-induced dermatitis, with its non-toxic and anti-inflammatory properties offering the potential for clinical trials to prevent these reactions. METHODS: This phase II randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial focused on adult females undergoing conventional fractionated RT. The main objective was to assess the efficacy of topical Curcumin in reducing the severity of radiation dermatitis. RESULTS: During a five-month study, 52 breast cancer patients completed the research. Participants were divided into Curcumin and placebo groups. In the first week, a significant difference in redness (P-value = 0.001) and irritation (P-value = 0.017) was observed, with the Curcumin group showing lower percentages. This trend continued in the second, third, and fourth weeks (P-value = 0.001). No statistical difference was found in itching (P-value = 0.446), and the occurrence of dryness (P-value = 1.000) remained constant in both groups throughout the four weeks. In pain the differences were significant in the second, third, and fourth weeks (P-value = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The study highlights the success of a 2% Curcumin gel in reducing skin side effects during breast cancer radiation therapy, suggesting its potential to enhance patients' quality of life.

The present study investigated whether curcumin improves cerulein‑induced CP fibrosis in a mouse model and pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). The CP mouse model was established by intraperitoneally injecting cerulein (50 µg/kg) for 3 weeks (six times at 1 h intervals/day; 4 days/week). To investigate the effects of curcumin, dimethyl sulfoxide or curcumin was injected intraperitoneally 1 h before the first daily injection of cerulein. To determine the severity of CP, the pancreas was harvested 24 h after the last cerulein injection for histological examination and assessment of PSC activation and collagen deposition. Additionally, levels of the nuclear factor erythroid 2‑related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase‑1 (HO‑1) were evaluated to determine the mechanism underlying the anti‑fibrotic effect of curcumin in PSCs. Curcumin improved pancreatic injury associated with CP by inhibiting PSC activation and collagen deposition. Moreover, curcumin increased HO‑1 expression levels via the activation of Nrf2 in PSCs, which suppressed the activation of PSCs. In conclusion, the present results suggest that curcumin can ameliorate pancreatic fibrosis induced by repetitive cerulein challenges via the induction of HO‑1 and is a beneficial agent for the treatment of CP.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Curcumin (CUR) is a natural compound with notable antitumor properties but faces limitations in topical applications due to poor aqueous solubility, instability, and insufficient skin penetration. To overcome these challenges, a nanomicellar formulation (TPGS30ELP15) was developed to enhance CUR solubility, stability, and skin penetration. This study aimed at evaluating the skin permeation and retention of CUR when delivered through nanomicelles alone or combined with a thermosensitive hydrogel for potential melanoma therapy. Methods: A CUR-loaded nanomicellar formulation containing CUR 5 mM was developed, characterized by particle sizes of 12-25 nm. Skin permeation studies utilized pig ear skin to assess CUR localization using both HPLC quantitative analysis and confocal microscopy. To improve patient comfort and application efficiency, the nanomicellar dispersion was incorporated into a thermosensitive hydrogel based on 16% Kolliphor® P407 and was able to undergo a sol-gel transition at skin temperature (32-36 °C). Formulations were evaluated for physicochemical properties, stability, and CUR distribution within skin layers using in vitro permeation assays. Results: CUR-loaded nanomicelles demonstrated selective localization in the viable epidermis (100-150 µm depth), bypassing the stratum corneum. The addition of the thermosensitive hydrogel enhanced CUR retention and distribution, prolonging contact at the application site and providing a gradual release profile. The hydrogel's sol-gel transition properties can facilitate ease of use and patient compliance. The combined system effectively delivered CUR to the basal epidermis, a target site for melanoma treatment, achieving therapeutically relevant drug concentrations. Conclusions: The incorporation of CUR-loaded nanomicelles into a thermosensitive hydrogel enhanced the solubility, stability, and targeted delivery of CUR to skin layers. This dual system represents a promising strategy for improving topical drug delivery for melanoma therapy, addressing limitations associated with CUR's physicochemical properties while ensuring patient-friendly application and gradual drug release."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Melanoma is a pathology that affects a large part of the population, and the currently available therapies have many limitations, including the selective targeting of the site of action. This study explores the development of curcumin (CUR)-loaded nanostructured delivery systems for topical melanoma treatment, addressing CUR's limitations in bioavailability, solubility, and stability. Methods: Binary surfactant mixtures of Vitamin E-TPGS (TPGS) and Kolliphor ELP (ELP) were selected to form stable micelles for curcumin encapsulation. A Design of Experiments (DoE) approach was applied to optimize the surfactant ratios for enhanced drug solubilization and improved cytotoxic effects on melanoma cells. The final formulation was characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to confirm its properties. Results: The final formulation, TPGS30ELP15, contained 30 mM TPGS and 15 mM ELP and led to formation of nanostructures of the expected size (hydrodinamic diameter, Dh: 13.11 ± 0.01 nm; polydispersivity index, PDI = 0.371 ± 0.05), able to solubilize 5.51 ± 1.09 mM CUR. The formulation was stable for a 120-day period stored at 4 °C and room temperature in the dark. Cytotoxicity testing in A375 melanoma cells demonstrated that curcumin-loaded micelles significantly reduced cell viability compared to free curcumin. Long-term exposure (24 h) revealed that free curcumin caused an 85% reduction in cell viability, while TPGS30ELP15 resulted in a 70% reduction. Additionally, free curcumin induced a 30% increase in cytoplasmic area, indicating necrosis, whereas TPGS30ELP15 decreased the cytoplasmic area by 20%, suggesting apoptosis. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that TPGS30ELP15 nanomicelles enhance curcumin's anticancer effects while promoting apoptosis and minimizing necrosis, which is associated with lower inflammation and tissue damage. These findings suggest that TPGS30ELP15 offers a more favorable therapeutic profile for melanoma treatment, paving the way for safer and more effective topical therapies."

      "abstract": "Background: Nasal steroids are commonly prescribed in ear, nose, and throat clinics. It is observed that the use of nasal steroids is increasing due to the prevalence of allergic rhinitis. Because beclomethasone (BCM) toxicity is low, it is highly preferred in allergic rhinitis. The rate of toxicity increases with the increase in the duration and dose of BCM use. However, the protective mechanism of Anatolian propolis (AP) and curcumin (Cur) against BCM toxicity has not been fully explained. Aim: The study evaluates the potential BCM-induced toxicity effect on VEGF, MMP-2, IL-25, and IL-10 parameters after Cur and AP treatment. Materials and Methods: Cell viability, oxidative stress, and gene expression were used for toxicity evaluation. Results: AP 2.5 mg/mL and Cur 16 µg/mL show high viability and antioxidant capacity. BCM increased the levels of IL-25, IL-10, and MMP-2, and a decrease was detected in the expression levels of FGF-2 and VEGF. Conclusions: AP and Cur show effective healing, and AP has been shown to improve inflammation more effectively than Cur. However, the combination of AP and Cur significantly improved the induced toxicity effects."

In this study, we developed an advanced nanogel formulation incorporating curcumin (CUR) and Pectis brevipedunculata essential oil (EOPb) within an F127/Carbopol 974P matrix to enhance bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy against Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis (LLa) promastigotes. Methods: The chemical profile of EOPb was determined through GC-MS and NMR analyses, confirming the presence of key bioactive monoterpenes such as neral, geranial, α-pinene, and limonene. The nanogel formulation (nGPC) was optimized to ensure thermosensitivity, and stability, exhibiting a sol-gel transition at physiological temperatures. Rheological analysis revealed that nGPC exhibited Newtonian behavior at 5 °C, transitioning to shear-thinning and thixotropic characteristics at 25 and 32 °C, respectively. This behavior facilitates its application and controlled drug release, making it ideal for topical formulations. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis demonstrated that nGPC maintained a stable nanoscale structure with hydrodynamic radius below 300 nm, while Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed strong molecular interactions between EOPb, CUR, and the polymer matrix. Biological assays demonstrated that nGPC significantly enhanced anti-promastigote activity compared to free CUR and OEPb. Results: At the highest tested concentration (50 μg/mL EOPb and 17.5 μg/mL CUR) nGPC induced over 88% mortality in LLa promastigotes across 24, 48, and 72 h, indicating sustained efficacy. Even at lower concentrations, nGPC retained dose-dependent activity, suggesting a synergistic effect between CUR and EOPb. These findings highlight the potential of nGPC as an innovative nanocarrier for daylight photodynamic therapy (dPDT) in the treatment of leishmaniasis. Future studies will investigate the underlying mechanisms of this synergism and explore the potential application of photodynamic therapy (PDT) to further enhance therapeutic outcomes."

In this study, chitosan (Chi), dextran (Dex), carboxymethyl dextran (mDex), lignin (L), and curcumin (Cu) were combined to develop materials with controlled release, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. The mechanical evaluation showed that Chi-mDex-L-Cu exhibited the highest diametral tensile strength (2.40 MPa), a 1233% increase compared to Chi-mDex-L, due to strong hydrogen bonding interactions between curcumin and matrix components. Curcumin release kinetics, modeled using the Weibull equation, demonstrated that Chi-mDex-L-Cu presented the slowest release rate, reducing the cumulative release by 55.66% as compared to Chi-L-Cu, ensuring prolonged bioactivity. Despite its controlled release, Chi-mDex-L-Cu retained 60% antioxidant and 70% anti-inflammatory activity, making it a promising sustained-release system. The biocompatibility assessment confirmed cell viability above 85%, with Chi-mDex-L-Cu showing a slight (~10%) reduction at higher concentrations while remaining non-cytotoxic.

Stability assessments demonstrated prolonged structural integrity under storage conditions. In vitro release studies conducted in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 5 and 7.4 revealed sustained drug release profiles. Biocompatibility and cytotoxicity assays using human astrocytes and fibroblasts confirmed the nanoparticles' safety, while antiproliferative tests on glioblastoma and colon cancer cell lines indicated potential therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, skin irritation and corrosion tests using the EpiDerm™ model classified the formulations as non-irritant and non-corrosive. These findings suggest that PHA-based nanoparticles offer a promising nanocarrier system for curcumin delivery, with potential applications in cancer treatment and regenerative medicine.

Chemotherapy is a common treatment for glioma, but many anticancer drugs exhibit poor permeability across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and fail to reach tumor tissues adequately, while also exerting toxic effects on normal cells. To address these issues, this study investigated the use of niosomes (Nio), which are biocompatible, biodegradable, and non-immunogenic, to encapsulate curcumin (Cur) and enhance its delivery to glioma tissues. Niosomes were prepared using the non-ionic surfactant sorbitan monostearate (Span 60) and cholesterol as carrier materials, and subsequently modified with transferrin (TF) to facilitate receptor-mediated transport across the BBB. The resulting TF-modified curcumin niosomes (TF-Cur-Nio) demonstrated enhanced targeting of brain tumors, improved anti-glioma efficacy, and favorable in vivo safety. These findings suggest that the TF-Cur-Nio delivery system has significant potential for advancing glioma treatment by overcoming the limitations of conventional chemotherapy and improving drug delivery to the brain.",

      "abstract": "Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) is the leading cause of secondary osteoporosis. Recently, the \"bone-gut axis\" theory has linked bone development with gut microbial diversity, community composition, and metabolites. Curcumin, a well-studied polyphenol, shows potential in mitigating bone loss and osteoporosis. Alendronate, a standard therapeutic agent for osteoporosis, serves as a positive control in this investigation. The study demonstrates the potency of curcumin in reducing bone loss and restoring bone mineral density, enhancing trabecular parameters notably through increased trabecular number, volume, and thickness and reduced bone marrow cavity size. Gut microbiome sequencing revealed that both curcumin and alendronate treatments similarly enhanced gut microbial diversity and altered microbiota composition, increasing beneficial bacteria (Akkermansia_muciniphila, Dubosiella_sp910585105, and Ruminococcus_sp910584195) while reducing harmful bacteria (Treponema_D_sp910584475 and Duncaniella_sp910584825). Furthermore, significant changes in serum levels of metabolites including raffinose, ursolic acid, spermidine, inosine, hypoxanthine, thiamine, and pantothenic acid were observed post-treatment with curcumin or alendronate. Importantly, these beneficial metabolites and microorganisms were negatively correlated with inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, curcumin holds promise for use against GIOP by modulating the gut microbiome and serum metabolome as well as reducing systemic inflammation.",

Curcumin is a polyphenolic natural compound extract from the rhizomes of Curcuma longa Linn (Zingiberaceae family) which showed important anticancer effects by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis in several cancer types. Recently, some studies reported that oral curcumin lowered PSA levels, but it did not modify the clinical outcomes in patients with prostate cancer who received intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD). Other studies reported that high concentrations of curcumin were toxic for patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study we showed that low doses of curcumin can induce senescence-like effects in 22Rv1 cell line while higher concentrations have cytotoxic effects. Five,15 and 30 µM curcumin blocked cell cycle in G2/M phase but only 15 and 30 µM curcumin induced cell death. In addition, an increased expression of p21, a known senescence marker, was detected in 22Rv1 cells treated with curcumin in every experimental condition. However, the expression of p16, another known senescence marker, increased only to 30 µM curcumin. CONCLUSION: In the context of personalized approach in PCa care, we suggest that the appropriate concentration of curcumin used in combination with radiotherapy or with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) could be taken into consideration.",

Given the intimidating nature of its treatment, curcumin (CUR) emerges as a potential therapeutic agent due to its proven effectiveness in managing MASLD. This review aimed to evaluate previous reports on the hepatoprotective and fat-accumulation-reductive effects of CUR administration in preventing or treating MASLD. CUR administration can modulate serum liver enzymes and lipid profiles. The fat accumulation of MASLD is the primary cause of oxidative stress and inflammation. By reducing fat accumulation, CUR may attenuate the inflammation and oxidative stress in MASLD. In addition, CUR has been proven to restore the dysfunctional cellular energy metabolism capacity and attenuate fibrogenesis (antifibrotic agent). Their hepatoprotective effects are associated with fat accumulation in MASLD. Lipid metabolism (lipogenesis, lipolysis, and lipophagy) is correlated with their hepatoprotective effects. CUR has prophylactic and therapeutic effects, particularly in early-stage MASLD, primarily when it is used as a fat reducer. It can be considered an excellent natural therapeutic drug for MASLD because it protects the liver and attenuates fat accumulation, especially in the early stage of MASLD development."

Excessive exposure to manganese not only increases manganese levels in the body, but can also disrupt the homeostasis of other trace elements. Elemental imbalance has been reported as a risk factor for several neurodegenerative diseases, and restoring elemental homeostasis may be a potential strategy to combat these conditions. We investigated the relationship between trace element dysregulation and cognitive function following different doses of manganese exposure in multiple tissues. Our results indicated that manganese exposure resulted in decreased learning and memory abilities, as well as impaired balance in rats. Manganese imbalance disrupted elemental homeostasis in several tissues. Hippocampal elemental dysregulation was associated with cognitive performance, and changes in aluminum levels in tissues also appeared to be closely related to cognitive function. Curcumin intervention ameliorated manganese-induced behavioural abnormalities and partially reversed manganese-induced elemental dysregulation, demonstrating its potential as a regulator of elemental homeostasis."

For this purpose, SH-SY5Y spheroids are differentiated using Retinoic acid-Brain-derived neurotrophic factor sequentially during 3D cell culture. Differentiated spheroids maintained high viability and exhibited significant neuronal characteristics, as evidenced by increasing β-III tubulin and NeuN expressions. 3D Alzheimer's disease model formation and neurotoxicity of Aβ 1-42 aggregates are investigated on un-/differentiated spheroids, resulting in 65% and 51% cell viability, respectively. Characterization of the 3D Alzheimer's disease model is done by immunostaining of Choline acetyltransferase to investigate cholinergic neuron activity loss, showing a 2.2 decrease in fluorescence intensity. Further, Curcumin treatment on the 3D Alzheimer's disease model resulted in augmenting cell viability, confirming neuroprotective effect of Curcumin on Aβ 1-42 induced Alzheimer's disease model.

      "abstract": "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a disorder that causes blindness in children at a high incidence. Retinal endothelial cells are damaged by variations in oxygen partial pressure, which leads to vascular obstruction and, eventually, ischemia and hypoxia, which cause the formation of new blood vessels. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of hyperoxic vascular occlusion. High oxygen levels are thought to cause ferroptosis. In this study, experiments with both animal and in vitro models demonstrated that elevated expression of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10)/C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) in retinal vascular endothelial cells induced ferroptosis. Curcumin decreased ferroptosis by inhibiting the production of CXCL10/CXCR3. Curcumin also preserved distal sprouts and filopodia, increasing tip cell and astrocyte counts. As a result, we hypothesize that curcumin reduces ferroptosis and preserves retinal blood vessels under hyperoxic conditions by suppressing the CXCL10/CXCR3 axis. Coimmunoprecipitation (COIP) data were used to determine which proteins interact with CXCR3 during ferroptosis. For the first time, our study applied curcumin to treat eye diseases in oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mice and explored the underlying mechanism in cell experiments, laying the foundation for clinical patients to use this drug. Exploring the interaction between CXCL10/CXCR3 and ferroptosis provides an experimental basis for using the CXCL10/CXCR3 axis as a therapeutic target for the treatment of ROP ophthalmopathy.",

In this study, the effect of curcumin on the Mcl-1expression and the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to ABT-737 were examined. Trypan blue assay and colony formation assay were performed to explore the effects of treatments on cell proliferation. MTT assay was performed to measure cytotoxicity. Cell migration was determined using a wound healing assay. Cell apoptosis was measured by Hoechst 33342 staining, ELISA cell death, and caspase-3 activity assay. The expression levels of Mcl-1 mRNA were also tested by qRT-PCR. Our results revealed that combination therapy significantly lowered the IC50 value and synergistically decreased the colony formation and migration, cell survival and growth of glioblastoma cells compared with curcumin or ABT-737 alone. Treatment with curcumin clearly inhibited the expression of Mcl-1 mRNA. Moreover, suppression of Mcl-1 mRNA by curcumin was associated with enhancement of apoptosis induced by ABT-737. In conclusion, curcumin has the ability to inhibit the cell proliferation and migration, and activate the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Moreover, it can enhance the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to ABT-737 by suppressing the expression of Mcl-1."

The above treatment procedure induces a secondary concern named as oral mucositis (OM). The disorder OM is specifically associated with oral mucosa and leads to bleeding, pain, difficulty in swallowing of solids, as well as fluids and speech difficulty. Curcumin is explored for prevention as well as treatment of OM. The article was organized via collection of enormous literatures by using the keywords like oral mucositis, chemotherapy, anti-inflammatory, curcumin, and clinical trials from search engines of different domains like Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, Science Direct, and Google Scholar with an increasing order of their year of publications. A numerous antineoplastic therapies resulted OM, as a devastating side effect. Moreover, the expanded pathogenesis of the disease permits a sound predictability over the patient's risk, thereby directing its adaptability and management protocols towards the achievement of novel therapeutics. An augmented interest towards curcumin as a potential therapeutic emerged because of its easy accessibility, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiulcer, antimicrobial, and wound-healing abilities along with reduced side effects. Curcumin can potentially alter OM and OM-induced weight loss but showed a great heterogeneity."

We integrated curcumin targets from BATMAN-TCM, DGIdb, and PharmMapper, and identified HS-related targets from GeneCards and OMIM. The intersection of these targets was identified using Venn diagrams, and subsequently analyzed through Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis.Protein interactions were analyzed using STRING and visualized in Cytoscape to screen core proteins. Molecular docking was performed with these proteins and curcumin. HS mouse model was constructed for pathological assessments and WB validation of core protein expression. We identified 132 potential therapeutic targets and selected AKT1, Bad, and CASP3 as our targets for validation. Molecular docking indicated that these proteins all have good affinity with curcumin. In HS mouse model, we observed that HS led to significant myocardial cell edema, disordered arrangement, and pronounced mitochondrial swelling accompanied by the destruction of cristae. The application of curcumin effectively alleviated myocardial cell edema and the degree of mitochondrial swelling. WB revealed that HS decreased p-Akt and p-Bad while increasing cleaved-caspase-3. Curcumin treatment reversed these effects, inhibiting HS-induced myocardial cell apoptosis. Our research demonstrates that curcumin effectively safeguards against HS-induced myocardial injury in mice, potentially through the modulation of the Akt/Bad/caspase-3 pathway.",

BACKGROUND: Cancer is a disease condition, where some cells grow uncontrollably, and if not controlled, they spread to other parts of the body. Concerning anticancer agents, curcumin has anticancer properties along with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant. Here in this study, the pharmacokinetic property was improved with the help of Carbon Dot encapsulation. OBJECTIVE: To improve the bioavailability of curcumin by improved encapsulation efficiency in carbon dots, to achieve a better cytotoxic effect of curcumin. METHODS: Bamboo leaves were used for the preparation of CDs and curcumin was loaded in them and the characterization for particle size, morphology, loading capacity, quantum yield, drug release in vitro studies, and in vitro cell viability activity as anticancer activity was done accordingly. RESULTS: Prepared CDs have a smaller particle size (< 10 nm), good loading capacity, stability, and excellent fluorescence activity. Studies on the release of curcumin have shown that a pH-5.5 solution leads to enhanced curcumin release. The CDs-curcumin shows enhanced toxicity against cancerous cells than the curcumin even at lower concentrations (20, 40, 60, 80,100 μM). CONCLUSION: Curcumin can be delivered by CDs, which have the advantages of increased bioavailability, small size, high loading capacity, improved photoluminescence, and biocompatibility. These characteristics can result in improved anticancer activities even at low concentrations."

This meta-analysis reviewed 14 randomized controlled trials involving 982 participants (466 in the intervention group and 516 in the control group) and evaluated curcumin's effects across 30 indicators grouped into cardiovascular health, oxidative stress and antioxidant markers, bone health, metabolic health, and quality of life. We found that curcumin reduced systolic (SMD -0.51, 95% CI -0.83 to 0.19, p = 0.002) and diastolic blood pressure (SMD -0.63, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.30, p = 0.005), increased total antioxidant capacity (SMD 0.93, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.72, p = 0.020) and superoxide dismutase levels (SMD 0.30, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.56, p = 0.026), decreased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.06, p = 0.020), and improved vasomotor (SMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.13, p = 0.003) symptoms. Curcumin positively impacts several indicators in postmenopausal women, highlighting its potential therapeutic role in managing cardiovascular risk factors, oxidative stress, hepatoprotective effects, and vasomotor symptoms. Due to variations in the purity and dosages across different studies and the lack of combinable data for certain indicators, the conclusions are still limited. These issues can be addressed through more comprehensive large-scale trials later. A more in-depth investigation into the mechanisms is also crucial."

In order to further elucidate the pathogen of citrus fruit rot in Yunnan Province, the pathogenic fungi causing citrus fruit rot were identified through isolation and purification, pathogenicity testing, morphological characteristics, and rDNA ITS sequence analysis. Meanwhile, we synthesized curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes, a potential management approach to control citrus postharvest pathogen, and conducted vitro and vivo experiment to investigate the effects of different curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes treatments inhibitory effect to pathogen A. alstroemeriae. The results showed that the pathogenic fungi of citrus rot diseases were A. alstroemeriae, Rhizopus arrhizus, Aspergillus flavus and Penicillium digitatum. The curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes had inhibitory effect on A. alstroemeriae, in vitro experiment showed that the minimum fungicidal concentration (MIC) of curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes against the hyphae growth of A. alstroemeriae was 10 μmol/L, and 4MIC treatment significantly reduced the occurrence of black rot in citrus fruit in vivo test. Curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes also enhanced the activities of the enzymes PPO, APX, POD, PAL, GR and CAT of citrus, decreased the O2 - production rate. The accumulation of ASA, GSH and hydrogen radical scavenging rate in Citrus reticulata Blanco 'Orah' were increased in the curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes treatment fruit, which may be directly responsible for the delayed onset of black rot disease. Furthermore, curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes treatment maintained the quality of citrus fruit by delaying the TSS, TA degradation and higher level of total phenolics and flavonoid contents in citrus fruit. Overall, our findings revealed that curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes, functioning as a plant elicitor, could effectively modulate physiological enzyme activities to confer the black rot resistance in citrus, which highlighted the potential of curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes for sustainable agricultural practices."

      "abstract": "Curcumin, a compound isolated from turmeric, has been found to have promising anti-tumor effects in various cancers, including anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC). However, the molecular mechanism of curcumin in ATC remains largely unclear. CD8 +T cells could eliminate rapidly proliferating malignant cells, whereas interaction between programmed death-1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) could inhibit the activation and functions of CD8 + T cells. Thus, we aimed to explore whether curcumin could inhibit ATC progression via regulating CD8 + T cells and PD-L1 expression. The protein expression of PD-L1 in ATC cells was detected by western blot assay. Additionally, a syngeneic mouse model was used to assess the effect of curcumin or/and anti-PD-1 treatment on tumorigenesis in vivo. The effect of curcumin on CD8 +T cell function was investigated by flow cytometry in vitro and in vivo. The results indicated curcumin notably suppressed ATC cell proliferation, migration and invasion and induced cell apoptosis. Additionally, curcumin could reduce PD-L1 level in ATC cells through inactivating AKT/mTORC1/STAT3 signaling. Meanwhile, curcumin obviously elevated CD8 + T cell function by elevating the number of IFN-γ producing CD8 + T cells. Furthermore, curcumin or anti-PD-L1 treatment could enhance anti-tumor immunity by increasing infiltration of CD8 + T cells in tumor tissues in vivo. As expected, compared to the single treatment, combination curcumin and anti-PD-1 treatment further elevated CD8 + T cell function in vivo, thereby potentiating anti-tumor immunity in ATC. Collectively, curcumin could enhance anti-tumor immunity in ATC by elevating CD8 + T cell function and inactivating the AKT/mTORC1/STAT3/PD-L1 axis. Our findings demonstrated a novel mechanism of the anti-tumor effects of curcumin in ATC.",

This study leverages the synergistic potential of curcumin (CUR) and berberine (BBR) co-crystals encapsulated in a nanohydrogel to address these challenges through a pharmacokinetically and pharmacodynamically targeted therapeutic strategy. The nanohydrogel formulation significantly improves the solubility, stability, and bioavailability of CUR/BBR co-crystals, optimizing their therapeutic delivery and sustained release under physiological and tumor microenvironment conditions. On the other hand, the dual inhibitory mechanism of CUR and BBR, with CUR covalently binding to the active site of caspase-3 and BBR non-covalently targeting the allosteric site, achieves enhanced apoptotic activity by disrupting both the catalytic and conformational functions of caspase-3. In vitro cytotoxicity assays demonstrate remarkable efficacy of the CUR/BBR nanohydrogel, achieving an IC50 of 12.36 μg/mL against HEC-59 endometrial cancer cells, significantly outperforming the individual components and the standard drug Camptothecin (IC50: 17.27 μg/mL). Caspase-3/7 assays confirm enhanced apoptosis induction for the nanohydrogel formulation compared to co-crystals alone and Camptothecin. Molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy analyses further validate the synergistic interaction of CUR and BBR in their dual binding mode. This study introduces a novel therapeutic approach by enhancing drug delivery and dual targeting mechanisms, demonstrating the potential of CUR-BBR nanohydrogel as a robust therapy for EC.

Inactivity and changes in lifestyle and subsequent overweight/obesity are becoming major health risk factors. OBJECTIVE: the aim of this study was to determine the effect of curcumin supplementation combined with high intensity interval trainings (HIIT) exercise on serum irisin and lipid profile in obese women. METHODS: 40 inactive women (aged 30-35 years, and body mass index 30 and above) allocated in four groups (10 in each) as followed; curcumin (C), exercise plus curcumin (EC), placebo (P), and exercise plus placebo (EP). All subjects completed an eight-week HIIT program. The C and EC groups received one capsule containing 80 mg curcumin nanomicelle daily throughout study. Blood samples were taken in the beginning and after eight weeks to measure changes in the study variables (irisin and lipid profile). The ANCOVA and Bonferroni's post hoc test was used to compare variables between 4 groups and pairwise at a significance level of ≤0.05 using SPSS-22. RESULTS: The results revealed that mean serum irisin (p = 0.023), cholesterol (p = 0.019), triglyceride (p = 0.022), high-density lipoprotein (p = 0.009) and low-density lipoprotein (p = 0.011) were significantly changed in all intervention groups compared to the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, it can be concluded that HIIT training with curcumin consumption has a greater significancy on obesity reduction in women; Therefore, curcumin and HIIT exercise can be considered as a therapeutic approach to reduce the negative outcomes of obesity. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY NUMBER: IRCT20141004019397N2, link. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study investigated the effects of curcumin supplementation combined with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on human serum Irisin levels for the first time, in a clinical randomized trial. This suggests that HIIT training alongside curcumin consumption may be a promising therapeutic approach to reduce the negative health consequences of obesity in women."

Nevertheless, oral use is incommodious due to its poor bioavailability. Numerous attempts have been made to increase its systemic bioavailability. Among these, an effective way to increase the bioavailability of curcumin is by combining it with probiotics to target the glucuronidation reaction. The present study focuses on the bio-enhancement of curcumin using probiotics in animal models of PD by alleviating oxidative stress and ameliorating dopamine levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two male rats were used for the study. Twelve animals were used for a bio-availability study in which curcumin was administered orally alone and concomitantly with a probiotic (Lactobacillus Rhamnus, 109 cfu, PO) to prove probiotics' ability to enhance curcumin's serum level by inhibition of β-glucuronidase activity. Serum curcumin level was estimated using the LC-MS/MS technique on 21 days of dosing. The remaining animals were used in an experimental study. PD was induced through 2.5 mg/kg rotenone (ROT). Subsequently, the animals were allocated to five groups and treated commensurately along with ROT. Three treatment groups were administered curcumin (alone, with 108 cfu, with 109 cfu). The standard control and disease control groups were supplied with sunflower oil. Effect on behavioral patterns, neurotransmitter and enzyme levels, and oxidative stress parameters were measured. Moreover, the brain was isolated for histopathology. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The bioavailability study revealed a significant (P-value <0.001) increase in the serum level of curcumin in concomitantly administered probiotics with curcumin-treated animals compared to curcumin-only treated animals. An experimental study showed improved behavioral parameters, brain dopamine level, acetylcholinesterase (AchE), and oxidative stress combined in the curcumin and L. Rhamnosus treated groups. A notable improvement in the histology of the brain was observed. These findings strongly indicate that combining L. Rhamnosus with curcumin may be an effective therapeutic solution."

      "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii is a priority bacterial pathogen and leading cause of nosocomial infections, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs). The average incidence of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii infections in ICUs is 41.7 cases/1,000 patients, highlighting the urgent need for more effective alternative therapies to replace carbapenems. Thus, this study aimed to investigate for the first time the antibacterial activity of curcumin in combination with the novel phage vB_AbaSI_1 to combat multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii in vitro. Phage vB_AbaSI_1 (capsid diameter 91 nm, contractile tail 94/20 nm) was isolated from sewage and infects ~ 29% of the 131 bacterial isolates examined. The 52,783 kb phage genome has 75 ORFs, encodes an integrase, lacks tRNAs/virulence genes, and belongs to the Caudoviricetes. Commercially sourced curcumin (400 µg/mL), combined with phage vB_AbaSI_1 (MOI 100) reduced MDR A. baumannii 131 to undetectable levels 1 h post-treatment at 37 °C, and this efficacy was further extended for 5 h in double-dosed phage/curcumin-treated cultures. In contrast, treatment with just phage vB_AbaSI_1 reduced bacterial growth but rebounded within 3 h, while curcumin-only treated cultures showed only 1-log bacterial reduction compared to untreated control. The phage/curcumin synergy occurred exclusively with phage-susceptible strains pre-curcumin exposure. This suggests the potential disruption of bacterial cell membrane during phage infection allowing curcumin entry, as no synergy was observed with phage-resistant strains. This innovative strategy of combining phage and curcumin showed great efficacy at controlling MDR A. baumannii and has a potential for therapeutic deployment. Future work will focus on engineering the phage to make it therapeutically acceptable.",

      "abstract": "Developing antimicrobial therapies not rely on antibiotics is an expective way to resolve the threat of drug-resistant bacteria, such as photodynamic antimicrobial therapy (APDT). However, the main antibacterial species in APDT are reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the overproduction of ROS will cause serious inflammatory and delay wound healing. Therefore, it is necessary to solve this contradiction in order to realize anti-inflammatory in the process of APDT. Here, we selected Ce6 as a photosensitizer for APDT, phenylboronic acid (PBA) was introduced on Ce6 (as Ce6-D-P) to get bacterial targeting, and then covalently grafted curcumin (Cur) on Ce6-D-P (as Ce6-D-P-C) to obtain anti-inflammatory ability. Finally, antibacterial poly(β-amino ester)(PBAE) was used as carrier to load Ce6-D-P-C to form nanoparticles Ce6-D-P-C@PBAE. Under light irradiation, ROS can be produced for APDT, and also, boroester bond on Ce6-D-P-C will broke to release small Cur molecules, and then released from Ce6-D-P-C@PBAE to perform anti-inflammatory. As a result, after ROS treatment, anti-inflammatory was achieved, forming stepwise antibacterial and anti-inflammatory therapy. The study showed that Ce6-D-P-C@PBAE was biosafe with good cell activity and also no hemolysis. The drug loading content of Cur in Ce6-D-P-C@PBAE can reach 11.2 %. When Ce6-D-P-C@PBAE was stimulated by light, the responsive release of Cur will achieve. In vivo studies, Ce6-D-P-C@PBEA can collaboratively kill bacteria and regulate inflammatory responses, as well as inhibiting and eliminating local inflammation, thereby promoting the healing of infected wounds. As a result, the Ce6-D-P-C@PBAE nanoparticles had both antibacterial and anti-inflammatory therapy abilities, which was important for combating bacterial infections and promoting wound healing.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to produce and evaluate nanofibrous wound dressings through the electrospinning method, utilizing polylactic acid (PLA), curcumin (Cur), and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). For this purpose, five types of wound dressings with PLA, PLA+Cur, PLA+Cur+ 1 %AgNPs, PLA+Cur+ 2 %AgNPs and PLA+Cur+ 3 %AgNPs were produced using the electrospinning method. Analysis of the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopic observations indicated successful fabrication, with nanometer diameters achieved in all electrospun samples. Examination of water absorption of wound dressings revealed that over 40 h the electrospun samples had variable water absorption between 0 % and 0.25 %. The results of the curcumin release test over one week showed that the nanofibers with PLA+Cur+ 2 %AgNPs exhibited the lowest release rate, while those with PLA+Cur+ 3 %AgNPs showed the highest release. Assessment of mechanical properties revealed that the tensile strength of the nanofibers increased by adding curcumin to polylactic acid, while the addition of a high content of AgNPs led to a decrease in tensile strength. Also, the PLA+Cur dressing demonstrated 84.06 % and the PLA+Cur+ 3 %AgNPs dressing exhibited 99.12 % antibacterial properties. The cell culture test demonstrated that the incorporation of curcumin and AgNPs increasedboth the growth and proliferation, as well as the adhesion on the nanofibrous wound dressing. Thus, the PLA+Cur+ 1 %AgNPs nanofibrous scaffold, as a multipurpose dressing, presented considerable promise for wound healing and burn treatment.",

The Cold Plasma mechanism relies on producing reactive oxygen species, but it also has disadvantages for biological materials. To prevent any negative effects, it is crucial to preserve protein stability during Cold plasma treatment. This research assessed the effects of cold plasma treatment on BSA in 30s, 60s, 120s, and 180s. Curcumin has been tested to assess its protective function against structural changes in proteins during cold plasma treatment. The effect of cold plasma on the structural changes of BSA in the presence and absence of curcumin were evaluated using UV-visible spectroscopy, autofluorescence spectroscopy, ANS fluorescence spectroscopy, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, thermal aggregation assay, and DPPH assay. Further investigation has been carried out by conducting molecular dynamic simulation. Curcumin, an antioxidant, has been shown to reduce structural changes in proteins when treated with cold plasma, according to our study. Curcumin in food sterilization process by cold plasma can be used to prevent protein content changes."

      "abstract": "Geroscience has helped to usher in a new and exciting era of aging drug development and evaluation of novel and repurposed agents, as well as natural compounds purported to target one or more aging hallmarks. Among the latter, curcumin has long been pursued as a promising strategy but has failed to provide convincing evidence in human trials. Oral intake is the typical route of administration tested for the vast majority of gerotherapeutic candidates, including curcumin, but efficacy is dependent upon good oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics. However, unlike FDA-approved oral medications, many natural compounds, such as curcumin, have poor oral bioavailability, which may explain their limited success in translation. To overcome these inherent limitations, we tested a novel solvent-based formulation of concentrated curcumin (VASCEPTOR®), developed for effective skin penetration and delivery of high amounts of bioactive curcuminoids directly to the circulation on aging and age-related conditions. We demonstrate that short-term topical treatment (7.5 mg per dose) with VASCEPTOR® twice per week can improve both vascular health in a rat model of hypertension, while a late-life intervention in aged mice improves multiple indices of health span, including improved exercise tolerance, motor coordination, diastolic function (p < 0.05), a reduction in frailty status (p < 0.05) and expression of some age-related markers in tissues, particular heart and kidney. Thus, these data suggest that the therapeutic potential of curcumin can potentially be dramatically enhanced by topical delivery and, along with other promising candidates, should be prioritized for further development, testing and deployment to potentially target some manifestations of aging in humans."

This randomized controlled trial was conducted on 50 women with endometriosis at the age of 25-35 candidate for ART referred to Roya Infertility Center in Qom, Iran, 2022. The participants were allocated to intervention (n = 25) and control (n = 25) groups by the blocked randomization method. Nanomicelle curcumin with a dose of 120 mg per day was given to the intervention group twice a day for 10 weeks, and the placebo with the same dose was given to the control group. Follicular fluid (FF) samples were collected from women with endometriosis stage III/IV undergoing ART. Antioxidant enzyme (MDA, SOD, CAT, and TAC) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8 and TNF-a) were tested. ART results such as (number of oocyte received, high-quality embryo, and pregnancy outcomes) were compared between two groups. Increased serum levels of TAC, CAT, and SOD were observed after nanomicelle curcumin treatment. Furthermore, FF levels of MDA, IL-8, and TNF-a reduced significantly after treatment in nanomicelle curcumin. Nanomicelle curcumin supplementation led to an improved number of oocytes retrieved, number of mature (MII) oocytes, fertilization, cleavage, and high-quality embryos. Nanomicelle curcumin treatment can modulate stress oxidative and inflammation in endometriosis-induced infertile patients. ART outcomes also improved after nanomicelle curcumin therapy. Our results suggest that nanomicelle curcumin can be a therapeutic target for infertile patients with endometriosis."

      "abstract": "Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a stable and highly toxic toxin that causes multi-organ toxicity with sustained ingestion, most typically in the duck liver. Previous research has shown that AFB1 can bring about endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in animals, and ERS is strongly associated with lipid metabolism. However, the relationship between AFB1-induced duck liver toxicity and ERS and lipid metabolism is currently unclear. Great attention has been paid to the prevention and treatment of AFB1 because of its great harm. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol, is notable for its powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Studies have shown curcumin to be protective against afb1-induced avian multi-organ toxicity. However, the effects of curcumin on the liver of ducks exposed to AFB1 are largely unknown. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether AFB1 exposure induces ERS and lipid metabolism disorders in duck liver, while exploring the positive role of curcumin in it. One-day-old ducks (n = 80) were randomly divided in four groups: control group, AFB1 group (0.1 mg / kg.bw AFB1), Cur group (400 mg/kg curcumin), and AFB1 + Cur group (0.1 mg/kg.bw AFB1 + 400 mg/kg curcumin), and blood and liver were collected for the study after 21 days of continuous administration. Our research has found that AFB1 exposure significantly increases the levels of liver function indicators ALP, AST, and ALT in ducks' serum (P < 0.05). Duck liver undergoes fatty degeneration under the influence of AFB1. Under the effect of curcumin, AFB1-induced structural damage in duck liver was somewhat controlled. Further experimental results showed that AFB1 treatment significantly increased the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (P < 0.001), and activated the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. Meanwhile, AFB1 inhibited the LKB1-AMPK signaling pathway and disrupted lipid metabolic homeostasis. And curcumin treatment effectively reversed these changes. Overall, our results suggest that curcumin attenuates AFB1-induced hepatotoxicity in ducks by inhibiting ERS and lipid metabolism disorders.",
