      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most important causes of infertility, irregular menstrual cycles, and anovulation in women. The current study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of Althaea officinalis L. (A. officinale) extract on PCOS in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, 70 rats in 7 groups (n=10/group) were studied for three weeks as follows; healthy control (HC), patient (PCOS), metformin (PCOS+MET), A. officinale treatment (PCOS+250 and 500 mg/kg A. officinale) and synergistic (PCOS+MET+250 and 500 mg/kg A. officinale) groups. Luteinizing hormone (LH), folliclestimulating hormone (FSH), progesterone (P) and testosterone (T) levels as well as inflammatory cytokines were measured. Total antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation levels were analyzed in ovarian tissue. The expression of GLUT-4, AKT, PI3K, PTEN genes and Ki-67 was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. RESULTS: A. officinale alone and especially in combination with MET moderated inflammatory and antioxidant parameters compared to the PCOS and MET groups. A. officinale in synergistic groups increased the apoptosis of granulosa cells by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway, resulting in a rise in the number of Ki-67 positive cells (P<0.05). Furthermore, following A. officinale treatment the LH/FSH rate decreased and FSH and P increased (P<0.05). Also, A. officinale extract could effectively normalize estrus cycle duration close to the normal group. CONCLUSION: The extract of A. officinale, in combination with metformin, can enhance the hypothalamic-pituitaryovary (HPO) axis with synergistic anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Additionally, the extract showed apoptotic effect on cystic granulosa cells."

      "abstract": "A chronic skin disorder called atopic dermatitis (AD) is brought on by the deterioration of the skin's barrier function marked by inflammation, dryness, and bacterial infection along with immunological changes. Althaea officinalis (AO), known for its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, has been explored as a potential treatment for AD. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a novel transliposomes (TL) formulation containing AO for AD treatment. Using rotary evaporation, AO-TL formulations were created and optimized employing Box Behnken Design. The optimized AO-TL formulation showed consistent characteristics: vesicle size of 145.8 nm, polydispersity index of 0.201, zeta potential of -28.22 mV, and entrapment efficiency of 86.21%. TEM imaging shows the spherical shapes of the vesicle. These findings demonstrate the formulation's stability and ability to encapsulate AO effectively. In vitro drug release studies revealed that the AO-TL formulation released 81.28% of the drug, outperforming conventional AO dispersion (56.80%). Additionally, when applied to rat skin, the TL gel demonstrated deeper penetration (30 μm) in comparison to the standard solution (5.0 μm) based on confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Ex vivo and dermatokinetics studies showed improved penetration of drug-loaded transliposomes gel in rat skin than the conventional AO gel. Overall, the optimized AO-TL formulation offers promising characteristics and performance for the topical treatment of AD. Its drug release, antioxidant activity, and deeper penetration suggest enhanced therapeutic effects. Further research and clinical trials are needed to validate its efficacy and safety in AD patients.",

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fourth cause of death due to cancer and includes 90% of liver tumors. Therefore, in this study, it was tried to show that Althaea officinalis L. flower extract (ALOF) can protect hepatocytes against N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma. Totally, 70 Wistar rats were divided into seven groups (n = 10/group) of sham, DEN, treatment with silymarin (SIL; DEN + SIL), treatment with ALOF (DEN + 250 and 500 ALOF), and cotreatment with SIL and ALOF (DEN + SIL + 250 and 500 ALOF). At the end of the study, the serum levels of liver indices (albumin, total protein, bilirubin, C-reactive protein, ALT, AST, and ALP), inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, and TNF-α), and oxidants parameters (glutathione peroxidase [GPx], superoxide dismutase [SOD], catalase [CAT] activity along with nitric oxide [NO] levels) were evaluated. The level of Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, p53, PI3K, mTOR, and AKT genes were measured. ALOF in cotreatment with SIL was able to regulate liver biochemical parameters, improve serum antioxidant indices, and decrease the level of proinflammatory cytokines significantly (p < .05). ALOF extract in both doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg in cotreatment with SIL caused a significant (p < .05) decrease in the p53-positive cells and a significant (p < .05) increase in Bcl-2-positive cells. Therefore, ALOF was able to modulate the proliferation of cancer cells and protect normal cells through the regulation of Bax/Bcl-2/p53 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. It seems that ALOF can be used as a prodrug or complementary treatment in the protection of hepatocytes in induced damages caused by carcinogens."

This trial was based on Persian medicine to compare how effective marshmallow aqueous extract 4% plus clotrimazole 1% (CLOT-M) is compared to clotrimazole 1% vaginal creams on VVC. METHODS: This study randomly assigned 100 women with VVC into two groups. The target group (n = 50) was treated with CLOT-M while controls (n = 50) with clotrimazole vaginal creams for seven consecutive nights. Different VVC symptoms and signs, and yeast culture from vaginal discharge were evaluated as the outcome measures before the intervention and 7 and 30 days after. RESULTS: The efficacy of CLOT-M vaginal cream was assessed during the 1st and 2nd follow-ups, indicating a significant decrease in mean itching (P = 0.001 for both comparisons) and dyspareunia score (P = 0.001 and P = 0.04, respectively) as compared to treatment with clotrimazole vaginal cream. Moreover, after 7 days of the intervention, patients in the CLOT-M group experienced significant improvement in mean dysuria score compared to those in the control group (P = 0.001). Neither cream caused any significant adverse events. CONCLUSION: It seems that CLOT-M vaginal cream had a significant effect on the VVC symptoms improvement, without any significant side effects. However, larger sample-sized trials are needed for more evidence-based judgment.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Althaea officinalis L.'s root extract (REA) has been used as a medicinal plant since ancient times to treat a cough. Applying REA leads to a protective film that induces a faster regeneration of the lesioned laryngopharyngeal mucosa caused by dry coughs. The buccopharyngeal mucosa is a highly vascularized tissue. In this regard, anti-inflammatory/-oxidant phytochemicals that improve the repair of the lesion site, e.g., neovascularization in the wound, are critical for promoting healing. For this reason, it is essential to investigate the effects of Phytohustil® and REA on different cellular components of the mucosa under conditions similar to those found in the injured mucosa. Thus, this in vitro study investigated the anti-inflammatory/oxidative and pro-migratory properties of Phytohustil® cough syrup on vascular endothelial cells. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were pretreated (24 h) with Phytohustil®, its excipients, or REA, followed by incubation with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 1 h; pro-oxidative) or with lipopolysaccharides (LPS; 3 h; pro-inflammatory). Viability and cytotoxicity were measured by PrestoBlue® assay. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified with 20-70-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA). The release of interleukin 6 (IL6) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The migratory capacity of HUVEC was measured using a scratch assay. Results: Our results show that Phytohustil®, its excipients and REA were not cytotoxic. Pretreatment of HUVEC (24 h) with Phytohustil® or REA inhibited the LPS-activated IL6 release. Phytohustil® or REA inhibited the H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and intracellular ROS production. Phytohustil® and REA significantly stimulated wound closure compared to the control. Conclusion: Our data show that Phytohustil® and REA have anti-inflammatory/-oxidant properties and improve the migratory capacity of vascular endothelial cells. These properties may contribute to the healing characteristics of Phytohustil® and support the benefit of Phytohustil® in patient's treatment of irritated oral mucosa."

      "abstract": "Althaea officinalis has been widely used in various pharmaceutical applications. The biological effects and significance of phenylpropanoids in numerous industries are well studied. However, fulfilling consumer demand for these commercially important compounds is difficult. The effect of heavy-metal toxic influence on plants is primarily due to a strong and rapid suppression of growth processes, as well as the decline in activity of the photosynthetic apparatus, also associated with progressing senescence processes. Some of the secondary metabolite production was triggered by the application of heavy metals, but there was not a stress response. In the adventitious root culture of A. officinalis, copper-mediated phenylpropanoid biosynthesis has been investigated in both concentration-and duration-dependent manners. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed a total of nine different phenolic compounds in response to different concentrations of copper chloride. In this study, high productivity of phenolic compounds was observed in the copper chloride treated-adventitious root culture of A. officianalis. In particular, a low concentration of copper chloride led to a significant accumulation of phenolic compounds under optimal conditions. Moreover, all genes responsible for phenylpropanoid biosynthesis may be sensitive to phenolic compound production following copper treatment. Especially, the highest change in transcript level was observed from AoANS at 6 h. According to our findings, treatment with copper chloride (0.5 mM) for 48 or 96 h can be an appropriate method to maximize phenylpropanoid levels in A. officinalis adventitious root culture.",

The treatments were administered every 24 hours. Wound closure rate, volume densities of collagen bundles, hair follicles, and vessels, vessel's length density and mean diameter, and fibroblast populations were estimated. Fibroblast populations, hair follicles, and mean diameter of vessels in the dermis of AO-treated groups were noticeably higher than those of control and base groups. Also, collagen bundles synthesis was significantly higher in the AO10%-treated group compared to the control and base groups. According to our research and previous studies, AO has the potential to be considered as an alternative medicine in wound healing treatment; however, further clinical investigations are suggested.",

      "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic relapsing eczematous skin disease, which primarily affects infants and young children. Due to the side effects of commonly used drugs for its treatment, the development of safer therapeutic strategies is needed. There are many reports on the topical use of marshmallow (Althaea officinalis) for a range of skin diseases in Persian medicine. The main aim of the present investigation was evaluating the efficacy of marshmallow in children with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. Another aim of the study was screening the anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory potential of phytocomponents against target proteins, including TNF-alpha, IL6, and PDEs A, B, and D enzymes with PDB IDs: 2AZ5, 1P9M, 3I8V, 4KP6, and 1Y2K, respectively, along with their respective standard ligands using computational docking analysis. A pilot clinical trial was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of Althaea officinalis in children with AD. The diagnosis of AD was made according to the criteria of Hanifin and Rajka. Children between 3 months and 12 years old were participated in this trial and randomly allocated into two parallel intervention and control groups. The intervention group used Althaea officinalis 1% ointment while the positive control group used Hydrocortisone 1% ointment twice a day for a week and after that, three times per week for a period of 3 weeks. The severity of AD was measured using the SCORAD score at the end of each assessment visits. A total number of 22 patients completed the study. A significant decrease of the SCORAD score was observed in both groups. At the end of the study, this score change, which indicates the improvement of the patients was significantly higher in the intervention group in comparison to the baseline (p-value = .015) and week 1 (p-value = .018). In the docking analysis of the study, 33 phytochemical compounds were identified, which were docked into the active site of IL6, TNF-alpha, and human PDE4 isoenzymes. Affinity toward the selected enzymes was significantly higher in glycosylated compounds. The results of this pilot study showed that the efficacy of Althaea officinalis 1% ointment in a decrease of disease severity is more than Hydrocortisone 1% in children with AD. However, further studies are needed to confirm this finding. Moreover, the docking analysis revealed that the inhibitory activity of compounds with free hydroxyl groups such as glycosylated compounds was better than others, probably due to the hydrogen bond interaction of hydroxyl groups of the ligands with the enzymes.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The medicinal plant marshmallow Althaea officinalis L. (A. officinalis), is used for the treatment of cough since centuries. Application of medicinal extracts of marshmallow roots shows immediate effects like a protective film on the inflamed mucosa. Because the soothing layer reduce irritation of the mucous system, a faster regeneration is supported by defense mechanisms required to protect the respiratory tract from environmental injury. Macrophages (MΦ), which belong to a group of multipurpose defensive cells, provide the first line of defense against mucosal invasive pathogens. The present study was performed to investigate, whether the herbal medicinal product has anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidative effects on pro-inflammatorily activated MΦ or after oxidative stress induction. Special attention should be payed to elucidate the effects of A. officinalis on the mechanism of intracellular defense as well as on migratory capacity of the MΦ. RESULTS: Treatment of PMA-differentiated human THP-1 MΦ with Phytohustil® increased their viability without affecting the cell number. Phytohustil® or root extracts of A. officinalis (REAo) - an active component of Phytohustil® - were able to protect human MΦ against H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and H2O2-induced ROS production. Phytohustil®, REAo or diclofenac used as anti-inflammatory reference substance, inhibited the LPS-induced release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) as well as of IL6 in MΦ. Treatment with Phytohustil®, its excipients or REAo did not impair the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Finally, Phytohustil® and REAo activated the migratory capacity of MΦ. CONCLUSION: The present in vitro investigations indicate protective, i.e., anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of REAo and Phytohustil®, additionally improving the migratory capacity of MΦ. These antiinflammatory effects were similar or even better than diclofenac. Thus, our data support and may explain the positive effect of Phytohustil® observed in patients during the therapy of inflamed buccal mucosal membranes or treatment of cough."

Compared with AOLPS-1, AOLPS-2 and AOLPS-4, AOLPS-3 had higher potential as a natural antioxidant and antimicrobial. At the same time, the infertility therapy effects of four fractions of AOLPS were in the order AOLPS-3 > AOLPS-4 > AOLPS-1 > AOLPS-2. The experimental study provides strong evidence to exploit A. officinalis leaf in food and pharma manufacturing processes and presents new benefit of this plant in infertility therapy.",

All information was extracted from scientific resources of PubMed Central, ScienceDirect, Wiley, Springer, SID, accessible books, reports, and theses. The results of animal and clinical studies confirmed the efficacy of A. officinalis extracts alone in treatment of dry cough, while combination of A. officinalis with Zataria multiflora, Zingiber officinalis, or Helix hedera increased the efficacy of A. officinalis and improved all kinds of cough. Different mechanisms are involved in expectorant and antitussive effects of A. officinalis in treatment of cough. Therefore, A. officinalis in combination with other plant extracts in different forms of drug could be a good choice for cough, sore throat, and other respiratory ailments.",

      "abstract": "Recently, an alternative disease treatment approach is the research of medicaments from traditional medicine. Plants with anti-oxidant capabilities are used as herbal treatments for ulcer diseases. Medicinal/herbal extracts containing phytoconstituents have significant anti-ulcer activities in in vivo experiments on animal models, compared to reference drugs. The current study aims to inspect gastro-protective as well as in vitro and in vivo anti-oxidant potential of Althaea officinalis and Solanum nigrum extracts on pyloric-ligation/indomethacin-induced gastric-ulceration in rats. Rats were divided into six groups: normal control, gastric ulcer control, two standard pretreatment groups receiving omeprazole and misoprostol, and two test pretreatment groups receiving Althaea officinalis and Solanum nigrum. Pretreatments were administrated orally for 14 days. On the 15th day, animals, excluding the normal control group, were exposed to pyloric-ligation followed by indomethacin injection. After four hours, the rat's stomachs were removed and gastric juice and blood samples were collected. Pyloric-ligation/indomethacin administration caused considerable elevation in ulcer number, ulcer index, acid and pepsin productivity, aggressive factors, and gastric mucosal lipid-peroxide contents. Moreover, reduction in titratable acidity, gastric mucosal nitric-oxide, anti-oxidant contents, and protective factors accompanied gastric-ulceration. Additionally, elevation in pro-inflammatory cytokines content and reduction in cystathionine-β-synthase and heme-oxygenase-1 expression was witnessed. Omeprazole, misoprostol, Althaea officinalis, and Solanum nigrum pretreatments fixed blood and tissue biomarkers, thereby protecting them from pyloric-ligation/indomethacin-induced gastric-ulceration in rats, which is hopeful for clinical examinations."

Phytochemical investigation of RE revealed the presence of N-phenylpropenoyl-l-amino acid amides 1-5, 8% glycine betaine 6, about 9% total amino acids with proline as the main compound, and about 61% mono- and oligomeric carbohydrates with sucrose as the main compound. Further fractionation revealed the presence of a hypolaetin diglycoside (12) and four hypolaetin glycosides (7-9 and 11) with O-sulfocarbohydrate moieties; additionally, 4'-O-methylisoscutellarein-8-O-β-d-(3″-O-sulfo)glucuronopyranoside (10) and the diglycosylated coumarin haploperoside D (13) were identified. The hypolaetin-O-sulfoglycosides 7-10 are new natural products. RE inhibited the enzymatic activity of surface-displayed human hyaluronidase-1 on Escherichia coli F470 cells with an IC50 of 7.7 mg/mL. RE downregulated mRNA expression of hyal-1 in HaCaT keratinocytes at 125 and 250 μg/mL, respectively. These data contribute to a deeper phytochemical understanding of marshmallow root extracts and to the positive influence of extracts used for therapy of irritated and inflamed buccal tissue and cough.",

Plants and their extracts known as phytomedicine have immense potential for the management and treatment of wounds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Due to the undesirable side effects, in the control and treatment of the wound infections, it is recommended to use natural materials such as phytochemicals instead of chemically synthesized drugs. Thus, the aim of this research was to study the anti-microbial and wound healing potential of Althaea officinalis L. hydroalchoholic extract in comparison with ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and penicillin antibiotics on clinical strains as well as pathogenic bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes under in vitro conditions using micro broth dilution and disc diffusion methods. Moreover, MIC and MBC of its hydroalchoholic extract was also evaluated. RESULTS: The results showed that although Althaea officinalis L. extract was not effective on gram-negative bacteria but it was efficacious on gram-positive bacteria. The extract was also tested in the form of topical administration on excision wound model in rats. In the extract-treated wounds, the wound healing percent was significantly increased in comparison with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this research, herbal extract of officinalis L. can be a great candidate for the treatment of gram-positive infections and merits further studies."

In this regard, the neuroprotective effect of Althaea officinalis (AO) has already been reported. Therefore, this study examined whether administration of AO extract would improve behavioral, biochemical and structural abnormalities in an experimental animal model of PD in rats. For this purpose, we induced hemi-Parkinsonism by unilateral intranigral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 8 μg/5 μl saline-ascorbate). The rats were pretreated i.p. with AO extract (10 mg/kg) started 6 days before surgery and continued until the 3rd day post-surgery. Regarding oxidative stress, brain MDA concentration (as a lipid peroxidation marker) increased significantly in the 6-OHDA-administered group in comparison with rats pretreated with AO extract. It was found that AO treatment attenuated rotational behavior in the 6-OHDA-administered group and protected the neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta against 6-OHDA toxicity. Overall, AO extract administration indicated neuroprotective effects against 6-OHDA-induced hemi-Parkinsonism in rats.",

OBJECTIVES: The aim of experiments was to investigate polysaccacharide influence on experimentally induced cough. METHODS: The purified and/or modified polysaccharides from the flowers and plants, characterized by chemical composition and molecular properties were subjected to tests for antitussive activity on cough, induced mechanically in conscious cats of both sexes. RESULTS: The results revealed that the tested polysaccharides exhibited statistically significant cough-suppressing activity, which was noticeably higher than that of the non-narcotic drug used in clinical practice to treat coughing. The most expressive antitussive activity was observed with the polysaccharide from marsh mallow, containing the highest proportion of the uronic acid constituent. Negative influence of the tested compounds on expectoration was negligible when compared to that of codeine. CONCLUSION: Antitussive activity of various plant polysaccharides was confirmed.

      "abstract": "It is known that expression of endothelin-1 (ET-1) increases in the epidermis after UVB irradiation, and that this plays an important role during the induction of pigmentation both as a mitogen and as a melanogen for normal human melanocytes (NHMC). When ET-1 acts on NHMC via the endothelin B receptor (ET(B)R) on their cell surface, mobilization of intracellular calcium is induced, which is followed by activation of Raf-1 located upstream of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). We have continued the search for new agent which inhibit this calcium mobilization and we have found that an extract of Althaea officinalis L. has such an action. In this study, we investigated the precise inhibitory mechanism of this botanical extract on the ET-1-induced activation of melanocytes. Treatment of NHMC with this extract abrogated the stimulatory effect of ET-1 on proliferation and also on activation of MAPK in the intracellular signal transduction pathway, but did not affect the binding of ET-1 to the ET(B)R or the production of Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate (IP3). Further, when this extract was used to treat normal human keratinocytes (NHKC), secretion of ET-1 by those cells was reduced. Taken together, these findings indicate that an extract of A. officinalis inhibits both the secretion of ET-1 from NHKC and the action of ET-1 on NHMC mainly by suppressing the ET-1-induced calcium mobilization without the modification of IP3 production, which in turn suggests that this extract is a useful ingredient for a whitening agent.",
