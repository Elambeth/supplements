      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a major public health problem among older adults. Forty percent of older U.S. adults take multivitamin/multimineral (MVM) supplementation. The effects of MVM supplementation on fractures is unclear. Preclinical and observational studies suggest that MVM and flavanols may have beneficial effects on bone. We conducted an ancillary study to COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS; NCT05232669) designed to investigate incident fracture and injurious falls in 21 442 COSMOS participants (12 666 females aged ≥65 years and 8776 males aged ≥60 years) randomized in a 2x2 factorial design to 1 of 4 intervention groups: cocoa extract + MVM, cocoa extract + MVM placebo, cocoa extract placebo + MVM, or double placebo. The daily cocoa extract supplement contained 500 mg/d flavanols and 80 mg/d (-)-epicatechin (Mars Edge); the daily MVM supplement was Centrum Silver® (Haleon). The median (interquartile range) duration of the intervention was 3.6 (3.2-4.2) years. Annually, participants self-reported incident fractures. In intention-to-treat analyses, we examined the effects of cocoa extract and MVM on the primary outcomes of total clinical fracture (hip, upper leg, forearm/wrist, pelvis, upper arm/shoulder, spine, knee, or other), hip fracture, and nonvertebral fracture, and secondary outcomes of clinical spine, forearm/wrist, major osteoporotic, and pelvic fracture using Cox proportional hazards models. During the intervention period, 2083 incident clinical fractures occurred. Compared with placebo, cocoa extract was not significantly associated with lower risk of incident clinical fracture (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.03, 95% CI 0.95-1.12) or nonvertebral fracture (aHR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96-1.14). MVM supplementation was not associated with lower risk of total clinical fracture (aHR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00-1.19), hip fracture (aHR 1.06, 95% CI 0.80-1.42), or nonvertebral fracture (aHR 1.10, 95% CI 1.00-1.20). These findings do not support the use of cocoa extract or MVM to decrease fracture risk in older individuals not selected for pre-existing osteoporosis."

      "abstract": "The seeds of Theobroma cacao L. are rich in antioxidant flavonoids such as flavan-3-ols, which are valued for their health benefits. In this context, it is of interest to improve flavanol content in cocoa extracts. The present study aimed at improving the clarification process of an aqueous cocoa extract using protein precipitation and filtration. Five pH modifications and two bentonite amounts were tested for their effects on protein precipitation and flavanol content. Micro- and ultrafiltration as a subsequent step was done by testing three different ceramic membranes (30, 80, and 200 nm). Lower pH in pre-treatment reduced protein content and kept flavanols constant, while at higher pH, flavanols were reduced up to 40%. Larger membrane pores enhanced polyphenol permeation, while smaller pores limited protein permeation. Adjusting pH to the isoelectric point increased protein adsorption, improving filtration quality despite decreased permeate flux. However, membrane fouling results in higher permeate quality due to increased selectivity. Furthermore, the addition of bentonite during filtration reduced both protein and flavanol content in the permeate, similar to the effects seen in the pre-treatment of the supernatant. Optimizing pH and membrane pore size enhances the recovery and quality of polyphenols during filtration, balancing protein removal and flavanol retention."

METHODS: COSMOS-Mind (N = 2262), a 2 × 2 factorial, randomized-controlled clinical trial administered a telephone-based cognitive battery at baseline and annually for 3 years. Incidence rates of MCI, and separately dementia, were compared among treatment arms with proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Over 3 years, 110 incident MCI and 14 incident dementia cases were adjudicated. Incidence rates did not vary by assignment to multivitamin-mineral or cocoa extract (all p's ≥ 0.05); however, statistical power was low. When participants assigned to multivitamin-mineral versus placebo converted to MCI, their scores for global cognition (p = 0.03) and executive function (p < 0.001) were higher and had declined less relative to the previous year (p = 0.03 for global cognition; p = 0.004 for executive function). DISCUSSION: Multivitamin-mineral therapy may provide cognitive resilience, countering conversion to MCI, but not significantly reduce its incidence over 3 years. HIGHLIGHTS: Multivitamin-mineral supplementation did not reduce risks for cognitive impairment. Cocoa extract supplementation did not reduce risks for cognitive impairment. Multivitamin-mineral supplementation slowed cognitive declines for incident mild cognitive impairment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dietary supplements are touted for cognitive protection, but supporting evidence is mixed. COSMOS-Mind tested whether daily administration of cocoa extract (containing 500 mg/day flavanols) versus placebo and a commercial multivitamin-mineral (MVM) versus placebo improved cognition in older women and men. METHODS: COSMOS-Mind, a large randomized two-by-two factorial 3-year trial, assessed cognition by telephone at baseline and annually. The primary outcome was a global cognition composite formed from mean standardized (z) scores (relative to baseline) from individual tests, including the Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status, Word List and Story Recall, Oral Trail-Making, Verbal Fluency, Number Span, and Digit Ordering. Using intention-to-treat, the primary endpoint was change in this composite with 3 years of cocoa extract use. The pre-specified secondary endpoint was change in the composite with 3 years of MVM supplementation. Treatment effects were also examined for executive function and memory composite scores, and in pre-specified subgroups at higher risk for cognitive decline. RESULTS: A total of 2262 participants were enrolled (mean age = 73y; 60% women; 89% non-Hispanic White), and 92% completed the baseline and at least one annual assessment. Cocoa extract had no effect on global cognition (mean z-score = 0.03, 95% CI: -0.02 to 0.08; P = .28). Daily MVM supplementation, relative to placebo, resulted in a statistically significant benefit on global cognition (mean z = 0.07, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.12; P = .007), and this effect was most pronounced in participants with a history of cardiovascular disease (no history: 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11; history: 0.14, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.31; interaction, nominal P = .01). Multivitamin-mineral benefits were also observed for memory and executive function. The cocoa extract by MVM group interaction was not significant for any of the cognitive composites. DISCUSSION: Cocoa extract did not benefit cognition. However, COSMOS-Mind provides the first evidence from a large, long-term, pragmatic trial to support the potential efficacy of a MVM to improve cognition in older adults. Additional work is needed to confirm these findings in a more diverse cohort and to identify mechanisms to account for MVM effects. HIGHLIGHTS: COSMOS-Mind was a large simple pragmatic randomized clinical trial in older adults conducted by mail and telephone. The trial used a two-by-two factorial design to assess treatment effects of two different interventions within a single large study. We found no cognitive benefit of daily cocoa extract administration (containing 500 mg flavanols) for 3 years. Daily multivitamin-mineral (MVM) supplementation for 3 years improved global cognition, episodic memory, and executive function in older adults. The MVM benefit appeared to be greater for adults with cardiovascular disease.",

      "abstract": "Cocoa polyphenols exhibit high antioxidant activity and have been proposed as a potential adjuvant for the treatment of metabolic disturbances. Here, we demonstrate that supplementation with low doses (14 and 140 mg per kg per rat) of a complete cocoa extract induces metabolic benefits in a diet-induced obesity (DIO) model of Wistar rats. After 10 weeks, cocoa extract-supplemented animals exhibited significantly lower body weight gain and food efficiency, with no differences in energy intake. Cocoa significantly reduced visceral (epididymal and retroperitoneal) and subcutaneous fat accumulation accompanied by a significant reduction in the adipocyte size, which was mediated by downregulation of the adipocyte-specific genes Cebpa, Fasn and Adipoq. Additionally, cocoa extract supplementation reduced the triacylglycerol/high density lipoprotein (TAG/HDL) ratio, decreased hepatic triglyceride accumulation, improved insulin sensitivity by reducing HOMA-IR, and significantly ameliorated glucose tolerance after an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. Finally, no adverse effect was observed in an in vivo toxicity evaluation of our cocoa extract at doses up to 500 mg kg-1 day-1. Our data demonstrate that low doses of cocoa extract supplementation (14 and 140 mg kg-1 day-1) are safe and sufficient to counteract obesity and type-2 diabetes in rats and provide new insights into the potential application of cocoa supplements in the management of the metabolic syndrome.",

Infarct size, the reduced glutathione (GSH), and the expression of phospho-Akt, P-GSK-3β, and P-eNOS were assessed. In isolated mitochondria, the Ca(2+)-mediated response of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), membrane potential (Δψm), and superoxide production were determined. PCE decreased infarct size, partly preserved GSH, increased the P-Akt, P-GSK-3β, and P-eNOS contents, improved mPTP response to Ca(2+), decreased the superoxide production, and restored Δψm. These data show that PCE decreases the cardiac postischemic damage in W rats and SHR and suggest that Akt/GSK-3β/eNOS dependent pathways are involved.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiometabolic profile is usually altered in obesity. Interestingly, the consumption of flavanol-rich foods might be protective against those metabolic alterations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the postprandial cardiometabolic effects after the acute consumption of cocoa extract before and after 4 weeks of its daily intake. Furthermore, the bioavailability of cocoa extract was investigated. DESIGN: Twenty-four overweight/obese middle-aged subjects participated in a 4-week intervention study. Half of the volunteers consumed a test meal enriched with 1.4 g of cocoa extract (415 mg flavanols), while the rest of the volunteers consumed the same meal without the cocoa extract (control group). Glucose and lipid profile, as well as blood pressure and cocoa metabolites in plasma, were assessed before and at 60, 120, and 180 min post-consumption, at the beginning of the study (Postprandial 1) and after following a 4-week 15% energy-restricted diet including meals containing or not containing the cocoa extract (Postprandial 2). RESULTS: In the Postprandial 1 test, the area under the curve (AUC) of systolic blood pressure (SBP) was significantly higher in the cocoa group compared with the control group (p=0.007), showing significant differences after 120 min of intake. However, no differences between groups were observed at Postprandial 2. Interestingly, the reduction of postprandial AUC of SBP (AUC_Postprandial 2-AUC_Postprandial 1) was higher in the cocoa group (p=0.016). Furthermore, cocoa-derived metabolites were detected in plasma of the cocoa group, while the absence or significantly lower amounts of metabolites were found in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The daily consumption of cocoa extract within an energy-restricted diet for 4 weeks resulted in a greater reduction of postprandial AUC of SBP compared with the effect of energy-restricted diet alone and independently of body weight loss. These results suggest the role of cocoa flavanols on postprandial blood pressure homeostasis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity has been associated with various health disorders, including psychological alterations. Cocoa consumption and weight management may produce a beneficial effect on these problems. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of cocoa extract supplementation as part of an energy-restricted diet on psychological status and peripheral dopaminergic activity in overweight or obese middle-aged subjects. METHODS: In a 4-wk, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel nutritional intervention, 22 men and 25 women [mean ± SD age: 57 ± 5 y; body mass index (kg/m2): 30.6 ± 2.3] were studied. After a 1-wk run-in period, volunteers consumed 15% energy-restricted diets; one-half of the volunteers were randomly assigned to receive ready-to-eat meals supplemented with 1.4 g cocoa extract/d (645 mg total polyphenols/d), whereas the rest of the volunteers received the same meals without cocoa supplementation. Plasma monoamines [dopamine, dopac, and homovanillic acid (HVA)], monoamine oxidase (MAO), and psychological status (anxiety and depressive symptoms) were analyzed in fasting participants at baseline and endpoint. Data were analyzed over time, and regression and correlation analyses were conducted to determine the relation between variables. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms decreased in both groups after the intervention (control: -9.4%, P < 0.001; cocoa: -6.3%, P = 0.008), but anxiety symptoms did not. The increase in plasma HVA was 11.5% greater in the cocoa group than in the control group (P = 0.016), but plasma dopamine, dopac, and MAO changes did not differ between groups. A negative relation between changes in depressive symptoms and changes in plasma HVA was observed in the cocoa group (β = -0.39, P = 0.029). Moreover, the change in plasma dopamine was positively associated with the change in methyl-catechin-O-glucoronide in the cocoa-supplemented group (r = 0.69, P = 0.019). CONCLUSION: The intake of cocoa extract by participants consuming a 15% energy-restricted diet contributed to an increase in plasma HVA concentrations. This change was associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms, suggesting a potential effect of cocoa extract intake on this relation. The present results are secondary analyses of a clinical trial that was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01596309."

This study aimed to analyze the effect of consuming ready-to-eat meals containing a cocoa extract, within an energy restricted diet on urinary metabolomic changes. Fifty middle-aged volunteers [30.6 (2.3) kg m(-2)] participated in a 4-week randomised, parallel and double-blind study. Half consumed meals supplemented with 1.4 g of cocoa extract (645 mg polyphenols) while the remaining subjects received meals without cocoa supplementation. Ready-to-eat meals were included within a 15% energy restricted diet. Urine samples (24 h) were collected at baseline and after 4 weeks and were analyzed by high-performance-liquid chromatography-time-of-flight-mass-spectrometry (HPLC-TOF-MS) in negative and positive ionization modes followed by multivariate analysis. The relationship between urinary metabolites was evaluated by the Spearman correlation test. Interestingly, the principal component analysis discriminated among the baseline group, control group at the endpoint and cocoa group at the endpoint (p < 0.01), although in the positive ionization mode the baseline and control groups were not well distinguished. Metabolites were related to theobromine metabolism (3-methylxanthine and 3-methyluric acid), food processing (L-beta-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine), flavonoids (2,5,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyflavanone-5-O-glucoside and 7,4'-dimethoxy-6-C-methylflavanone), catecholamine (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol-sulphate) and endogenous metabolism (uridine monophosphate). These metabolites were present in higher (p < 0.001) amounts in the cocoa group. 3-Methylxanthine and l-beta-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine were confirmed with standards. Interestingly, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol-sulphate was positively correlated with 3-methylxanthine (rho = 0.552; p < 0.001) and 7,4'-dimethoxy-6-C-methylflavanone (rho = 447; p = 0.002). In conclusion, the metabolomic approach supported the compliance of the volunteers with the intervention and suggested the bioavailability of cocoa compounds within the meals.",

      "abstract": "It is currently thought that the lackluster performance of translational paradigms in the prevention of age-related cognitive deteriorative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), may be due to the inadequacy of the prevailing approach of targeting only a single mechanism. Age-related cognitive deterioration and certain neurodegenerative disorders, including AD, are characterized by complex relationships between interrelated biological phenotypes. Thus, alternative strategies that simultaneously target multiple underlying mechanisms may represent a more effective approach to prevention, which is a strategic priority of the National Alzheimer's Project Act and the National Institute on Aging. In this review article, we discuss recent strategies designed to clarify the mechanisms by which certain brain-bioavailable, bioactive polyphenols, in particular, flavan-3-ols also known as flavanols, which are highly represented in cocoa extracts, may beneficially influence cognitive deterioration, such as in AD, while promoting healthy brain aging. However, we note that key issues to improve consistency and reproducibility in the development of cocoa extracts as a potential future therapeutic agent requires a better understanding of the cocoa extract sources, their processing, and more standardized testing including brain bioavailability of bioactive metabolites and brain target engagement studies. The ultimate goal of this review is to provide recommendations for future developments of cocoa extracts as a therapeutic agent in AD.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Nutrient excess and unbalanced diets can result in overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are associated with oxidative stress. Cocoa extract contains antioxidants that inhibit the harmful effects of ROS. This trial analysed the effect of cocoa extract consumption integrated as a bioactive compound into ready-to-eat meals, on oxidative stress at the level of DNA in overweight/obese subjects. Fifty volunteers [57.26(5.24) years, 30.59(2.33)kg/m(2)] participated in a 4-week double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled parallel nutritional intervention. Half of the volunteers received meals supplemented with 1.4 g/day cocoa extract, while the other half received control meals, both within a 15% energy restriction diet. Lymphocytes were isolated and endogenous strand breaks, oxidised bases and resistance to H2O2-induced damage were measured by the comet assay. The intake of ready-to-eat meals supplemented with cocoa extract did not show relevant changes in the oxidative status of DNA. However, in the cocoa group, oxidised bases negatively correlated with methyl epicatechin-O-sulphate (r = -0.76; P = -0.007) and epicatechin sulphate (r = -0.61; P = -0.046). When volunteers of both groups were analysed together, a marginal decrease (P = 0.072) in oxidised bases was observed, which attributed to weight loss. Subjects who started the intervention with higher levels of damage showed a greater reduction in oxidised bases after 4 weeks (P = 0.040) compared to those who had lower baseline levels. In conclusion, even if 1.4 g of cocoa supplementation for 4 weeks did not show notable changes in terms of antioxidant status of DNA, the energy restriction showed a slightly decrease in oxidised bases and this was seen to a greater extent in subjects who started the intervention with higher levels of damage. On the other hand, the inverse associations found between oxidised bases and some cocoa-derived metabolites suggest that a protective effect might be seen in a longer period of time or in subjects with higher baseline DNA damage.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cocoa flavanols are recognised by their favourable antioxidant and vascular effects. This study investigates the influence on health of the daily consumption of ready-to-eat meals supplemented with cocoa extract within a hypocaloric diet, on middle-aged overweight/obese subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty healthy male and female middle-aged volunteers [57.26 ± 5.24 years and body mass index (BMI) 30.59 ± 2.33 kg/m(2)] were recruited to participate in a 4 week randomised, parallel and double-blind study. After following 3 days on a low-polyphenol diet, 25 volunteers received meals supplemented with 1.4 g of cocoa extract (645.3 mg of polyphenols) and the other 25 participants received control meals, within a 15% energy restriction diet. On the 4th week of intervention individuals in both dietary groups improved (p < 0.05) anthropometric, body composition, blood pressure and blood biochemical measurements. Oxidised LDL cholesterol (oxLDL), showed a higher reduction (p = 0.030) in the cocoa group. Moreover, myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels decreased only in the cocoa supplemented group (p = 0.007). Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (sICAM-1) decreased significantly in both groups, while Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) did not present differences after the 4 weeks of intervention. Interestingly, cocoa intake showed a different effect by gender, presenting more beneficial effects in men. CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of cocoa extract as part of ready-to-eat meals and within a hypocaloric diet improved oxidative status (oxLDL) in middle-aged subjects, being most remarkable in males.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of cocoa flavonoids in breast cancer cells at the molecular level, a functional genomic analysis was performed using a polyphenolic cocoa extract (PCE) in MCF-7 and SKBR3 cell lines. METHODS: The expression profile of 84 genes included in the Stress & Toxicity PathwayFinder™ PCR Array was analyzed after PCE incubation for 24 h. mRNA and protein levels were analyzed by RT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Gel shift assays were used to evaluate DNA-protein complexes. Protein complexes were identified by co-immunoprecipitation. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assays. RESULTS: Upon PCE incubation, 7 genes were overexpressed and 1 underexpressed in MCF-7 cells, whereas 9 genes were overexpressed in SKBR3 cells. Among the differentially expressed genes in both cell lines, cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1) was chosen for further study. CYP1A1 mRNA and protein levels and enzymatic activity increased upon PCE incubation. CYP1A1 transcriptional activation by PCE was mediated through AhR binding to XRE elements within the CYP1A1 promoter in MCF-7 cells. A protein complex including AhR and ERα was detected. The combination of PCE with tamoxifen caused a synergistic cytotoxicity in both cell lines and was due to an increase in apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The interaction between ERα and AhR upon incubation with PCE leads to CYP1A1 induction in breast cancer cells. The synergy between PCE and non-cytotoxic tamoxifen concentrations opens the possibility for a combination therapy based on polyphenols from cocoa that increased tamoxifen efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Oxidants have been shown to be involved in alcohol-induced liver injury. This study was designed to determine whether cocoa flavonoid extract, composed mostly of epicatechin and epicatechin oligomers, protects against early alcohol-induced liver injury in rats. Male Wistar rats were fed high-fat liquid diets with or without ethanol (10-14 g/kg per day) and cocoa extract (400 mg/kg per day) continuously for 4 weeks using an enteral feeding protocol. Mean body weight gains ( approximately 4 g/day) were not significantly different between treatment groups. Cocoa extract did not affect average daily urine ethanol concentrations ( approximately 200mg/dL). After 4 weeks, serum alanine amino transferase levels of the ethanol group were increased nearly fourfold (110+/-16 IU/L) compared to control values (35+/-3 IU/L); this effect of ethanol was blocked by cocoa extract (60+/-6 IU/L). Additionally, enteral ethanol caused severe fat accumulation, mild inflammation, and necrosis in the liver; cocoa extract significantly blunted these changes. Increases in liver TNFalpha protein levels caused by ethanol were completely blocked by cocoa extract. Further, ethanol significantly increased the accumulation of protein adducts of 4-hydroxynonenal, a product of lipid peroxidation serving as an index of oxidative stress; again this was counteracted by the addition of cocoa extract. These results indicate that dietary flavanols such as those found in cocoa can prevent early alcohol-induced liver injury.",
