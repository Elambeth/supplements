      "abstract": "Early weaning is an essential practice in pig farming to achieve better economic returns; however, insufficient nutrition during the early weaning stage can result in poor growth and increased mortality. This study evaluated the effects of Moringa oleifera leaf meal (MOLM) supplementation on intake, growth performance, oxidative stress, behavioral responses, and economic outcomes in early weaned Landlly piglets. A total of 16 Landlly piglets, weaned at 35 days with an average body weight of 8.66 ± 0.38 kg, were used in this study. These piglets were randomly divided into two groups, with 8 piglets in each group. The control group was fed a basal diet, while the treatment group received the same basal diet supplemented with 5% MOLM. MOLM supplementation significantly improved growth performance, with the treatment group achieving a 9.24% higher final body weight and a 17.73% greater body weight gain compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Oxidative stress, measured through malondialdehyde levels, was significantly reduced in the treatment group (P = 0.04), indicating that MOLM mitigated lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage. Behavioral observations revealed a significant reduction in stress-related like belly nosing (P < 0.001). Additionally, cortisol levels were significantly lower in the treatment group by day 14 (P = 0.013). MOLM supplementation resulted in a lower cost of rearing per piglet and a higher net profit. This study concluded that MOLM supplementation not only improved growth performance, reduced oxidative stress and stress-related behaviors but also provided a substantial economic benefit, making it a viable nutritional strategy for improving the profitability in piglet production systems.",

      "abstract": "This research aimed to evaluate the impact of various herbal additions on the quality and sensory attributes of moringa (Moringa oleifera Lam)-based instant beverages. The study was conducted in several laboratories at Tadulako University and the Goods Quality Testing and Certification Unit in Palu. Physicochemical properties (water content, vitamin C, antioxidants, solution pH, and dissolution time) were evaluated using a completely randomized design. At the same time, sensory attributes such as color, aroma, and taste were examined using a randomized block design. The experiment tested six different herbal additions: P0 (no herbs), P1 (red ginger), P2 (lemongrass), P3 (galangal), P4 (white turmeric), and P5 (yellow turmeric), with each treatment repeated three times. Results showed that yellow turmeric yielded the best physicochemical outcomes, with a dissolution time of 83 seconds, a water content of 5.27%, a pH of 6.36, a vitamin C content of 12.44%, and an antioxidant activity of 49.25%. In contrast, red ginger emerged as the most preferred by panelists, scoring highest in terms of color, aroma, and taste, with values of 3.50, 3.97, and 3.60, respectively. The findings indicate that herbal additives can enhance the functional properties and sensory appeal of moringa instant drinks. Yellow turmeric effectively optimized physicochemical traits, making the beverage more suitable for health-conscious consumers. Meanwhile, red ginger improved sensory appeal, increasing the likelihood of consumer acceptance. Future research should optimize the concentrations of yellow turmeric and red ginger to balance their effects on physicochemical and sensory qualities, investigate advanced drying techniques to meet Indonesian National Standard 4320:1996 water content standards, and explore the bioavailability and health impacts of these products."

      "abstract": "Moringa leaf is traditionally regarded as a natural antagonistic diabetic herb in many countries. This study aimed to investigate the potential hypoglycemic activity of Moringa dietary fibers (MDFs) with different particle sizes in vitro and in vivo and reveal the related mechanisms. Among MDFs, MDF200 exhibited the highest glucose adsorption and diffusion retarding capacities and the most effective inhibition of digestive enzyme activities in vitro. All MDF interventions ameliorated insulin resistance and tissue damage, alleviated oxidative stress and dyslipidemia in high-fat diet and streptozotocin induced type 2 diabetes mice in vivo. MDF interventions, especially MDF80 and MDF200, remarkably promoted the diversity of cecum flora and the abundance of beneficial intestinal bacteria (Ileibacterium, Bifidobacterium), while inhibited the harmful bacteria (Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1). The ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes was significantly reduced by MDF40 and MDF80 interventions. MDF80 promoted fecal acetic acid, butyric acid and total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), while MDF40 promoted fecal propionic acid. All MDF interventions remarkably promoted the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and stimulated higher G protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) protein expression in liver. Larger MDF activated phosphorylation of AMPK and Erk, while smaller MDF stimulated GLP-1, more PI3K and phosphorylation of Akt protein expression. These results revealed that MDFs ameliorated T2DM through modulating microbiota-SCFAs receptor (GPR43)/AMPK signaling pathways and stimulating GLP-1 secretion and activated liver PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. This study offers an effective case for MDFs as a potential dietary intervention or adjuvant treatment for type 2 diabetes and the application of Moringa leaf as a functional food material.",

      "abstract": "Resource recovery based fecal sludge (FS) treatment is crucial for developing countries to align with Sustainable Development Goals 6 and 7, which target clean water and sanitation for all and affordable and clean energy, respectively. This study, therefore, compared the coagulation-flocculation potential of aqueous Moringa stenopetala seed extract (MSE) to that of alum from a resource recovery perspective. A response surface central composite design was employed, using pH and coagulant dose as independent variables for each coagulant, with five levels resulting in 13 total runs for each coagulant. Multi-response optimization and modelling, which was not addressed in previous similar studies on FS, was employed to maximize chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and energy content of the sludge, increase total solid concentration and minimize sludge volume. The optimum working conditions for MSE were a dose of 216 mg/g TS of FS at pH 2.2, while for alum, the optimum dose was 98 mg/g TS of FS at pH 6. At these optimum conditions, MSE achieved 94 % COD removal, a calorific value of 18.4 MJ/kg, a sludge volume of 259 mL/L and a TS concentration of 48.8 g/L. In comparison, alum achieved 92 % COD removal, a calorific value of 17.3 MJ/kg, a sludge volume of 370 mL/L and a TS concentration of 32.7 g/L. These results emphasize that MSE has greater potential as a coagulant than alum from a resource recovery perspective.",

      "abstract": "Moringa oleifera (MO) is a prominent plant in traditional medicine, widely recognized for its phytochemicals with anti-inflammatory properties. Liver fibrosis characterized by chronic inflammation and excessive extracellular matrix deposition may benefit from the therapeutic properties of MO. This report focuses on the potential of oleamide (OLA), a bioactive compound identified from MO, in mitigating liver fibrosis. The anti-fibrotic effects of OLA were evaluated by assessing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, gelatinase activity and the expression of genes and proteins associated with the TGF-β/SMAD2/3 pathway. The LX-2 human hepatic stellate cell line, in conjunction with TGF-β1, was employed to model fibrotic conditions. OLA treatment significantly reduced the production of pro-fibrotic effectors in the activated LX-2 cells. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated a high binding affinity of OLA to key proteins in the TGF-β/SMAD2/3 pathway, while qRT-PCR and Western blotting revealed that OLA suppressed the expression of COL1A1, COL4A1, SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4, MMP2, MMP9, ACTA2 and TIMP1. These findings indicate that OLA effectively attenuates the pro-inflammatory responses induced by TGF-β1 and inhibits the activation of LX-2 cells. Collectively, OLA holds significant potential as a therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of liver fibrosis via the modulation of the TGF-β/SMAD2/3 signaling pathway.",

Despite advances in chemotherapy in recent years, more than 50% of adult T-ALL patients still experience treatment resistance and relapse/refractory disease. Moringa oleifera, a new food resource in China, has high nutritional value and various pharmacological activities. Moringa oleifera protein is one of the main active ingredients in Moringa oleifera leaves, and some studies have shown that Moringa oleifera protein has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anticancer, and other bioactivities; however, the anti-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) activity of the Moringa oleifera protein and its mechanism of action are still unclear. In this study, we used Moringa oleifera leaves protein as the experimental material and used the MTT assay, flow cytometry, and Western blot techniques to study the effects of Moringa oleifera leaves protein on Jurkat cell growth, apoptosis, and the cell cycle in vitro and the underlying molecular mechanism. Moringa oleifera leaves protein inhibited Jurkat cell proliferation; induced apoptosis and cycle arrest; increased autophagy; and inhibited Jurkat cell proliferation by regulating the MAPK/AKT pathway. The results of this study provide new ideas and a theoretical basis for the development of Moringa oleifera leaves protein for the prevention and treatment of leukemia.",

To address these challenges, this research explored how steam-treated MLP (SMLP) influences the expansion and sensory qualities of bread. MLP was steamed for 10 min in an electric oven, sieved, and incorporated at a 5% substitution level for wheat flour in bread formulations. SMLP improved the specific loaf volume, increasing it from 2.2 to 4.6 cm3/g compared to MLP. It also mitigated the inhibition of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (brewer's yeast) viability induced by MLP, increasing its viability from 48% to 72%. Despite minor reductions, the antioxidant activity and quercetin-3-glucoside content remained high after treatment with SMLP. Moreover, SMLP delayed bread staling by reducing starch retrogradation enthalpy by 30-40%. Sensory evaluations revealed significant improvements in the aroma, appearance, and overall acceptability of bread prepared with SMLP compared to that prepared with MLP. This study demonstrated that steam treatment can enhance the potential and applicability of MLP as a functional food ingredient."

In the present study, we investigated the antioxidant activity and effect of M. oleifera leaf infusion on hematological, biochemical, histological, and genotoxic parameters, as well as the liver antioxidant environment in mice treated with methotrexate (MTX). In vitro antioxidant activity was examined using DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS [2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] assays. Female Swiss albino mice were treated with distilled water (negative control), infusion (1000 mg/kg), MTX 20 mg/kg (positive control), or infusion (1000 mg/kg) before administration of MTX (20 mg/kg). After five days, their blood was collected for hematological, biochemical, and genotoxic examination (comet assay), and their organs were examined for macroscopic and histological patterns. Liver homogenates were obtained and used to evaluate the in vivo antioxidant activity. The infusion showed antioxidant activity with the concentration that scavenged 50 % of the free radical (IC50) equal to 51.51 ± 4.54 µg/mL and 53.95 ± 3.26 µg/mL observed using DPPH and ABTS tests, respectively. The blood of animals that had received the leaf infusion before MTX administration did not show altered biochemical or hematological parameters. In comet assay, damage index (DI) and damage frequency (DF) caused by MTX (DI=119.4; DF=50.67) were reduced with previous treatment with infusion (DI=48.29; DF=17.0). The infusion-MTX group showed higher superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, and reduced glutathione levels than those seen in the other groups. In conclusion, M. oleifera leaf infusion is a source of polyphenols with antioxidant activity and reduced mice damages induced by MTX administration."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bovine subclinical mastitis is a significant disease that significantly impacts the health of dairy cows and subsequently affects milk production. Among the various causes of subclinical mastitis, bacterial infections, particularly Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), play a crucial role. AIM: The aim of this investigation was to isolate and identify S. aureus strains from cows with subclinical mastitis, assess their antimicrobial susceptibility, virulence genes, and investigate the potential antibacterial activity of Moringa oleifera ethanolic extract and Selenium (Se) nanoparticles against both somatic cell count (SCC) and S. aureus count in subclinical mastitic cows. METHODS: We collected 110 milk samples from dairy cows with subclinical mastitis in the Kafrelsheikh governorate before treatment with intramammary antibiotics. Samples were identified using pH detection, SCC at ≤200,000 cells/ ml, and California Mastitis Test. RESULTS: The effect of M. oleifera ethanolic extract, Se nanoparticles, and Ciprofloxacin antibiotic in reducing SCC and S. aureus counts was significant. Selenium nanoparticles and Ciprofloxacin antibiotics showed the highest reduction in the S. aureus count, comparable to M. oleifera ethanolic extract, while ciprofloxacin followed by M. oleifera ethanolic extract, and Selenium nanoparticles were effective against somatic cell count. CONCLUSION: This study emphasizes the widespread occurrence of S. aureus in subclinical bovine mastitis and highlights the potential of M. oleifera ethanolic extract and Se nanoparticles as promising treatment options. Selenium nanoparticles demonstrated notable antibacterial effects against S. aureus and contributed to a reduction in somatic cell counts. Considering these findings, we propose additional studies on the potential of Selenium nanoparticles as antibacterial agents, as they demonstrate effectiveness in preventing and managing S. aureus subclinical mastitis.",

This study aimed to evaluate the potential antihypertensive effects of MO seeds in rats subjected to Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) exposure. Fifty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups of 10 rats each for the experiment. Group A served as the control, received normal saline only, Group B received L-NAME (40 mg/kg) only, Group C received L-NAME (40 mg/kg) + 10% MO feed, Group D received L-NAME (40 mg/kg) + 20% MO feed, and Group E received L-NAME (40 mg/kg) + Lisinopril (10 mg/kg). Treatment was daily and covered a period of 5 weeks. Blood pressure and electrocardiographic measurements were obtained using a non-invasive tail cuff blood pressure device and a 6/7 lead computer ECG equipment, respectively. Heart and kidney tissues were analyzed for oxidative stress parameters, and immunohistochemistry and histopathology of the heart and kidney were conducted using standard methods. L-NAME treatment led to a significant increase in diastolic and systolic values compared to the control group. Serum nitric oxide concentration significantly decreased in rats that received L-NAME alone, while co-treatment with MO and Lisinopril showed a significant increase in nitric oxide levels. Co-treatment with MO and Lisinopril significantly reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in the cardiac and renal tissues, whereas L-NAME alone caused a significant increase in MDA concentration. The expressions of cardiac and renal caspase-3 significantly increased in L-NAME alone treated rats, while co-treatments with MO and Lisinopril significantly reduced the expressions of caspase-3. In conclusion, co-treatment with MO effectively reduced arterial pressure and indices of hypertension in rats, mitigated the oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by L-NAME. Therefore, the inclusion of MO seeds in hypertension management may serve as an effective remedy.",

      "abstract": "Moringa oleifera (MO) has been recognized for its numerous beneficial properties. This study aimed to evaluate the potential antihypertensive effects of MO seeds in rats subjected to Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) exposure. Fifty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups of 10 rats each for the experiment. Group A served as the control, received normal saline only, Group B received L-NAME (40 mg/kg) only, Group C received L-NAME (40 mg/kg) + 10% MO feed, Group D received L-NAME (40 mg/kg) + 20% MO feed, and Group E received L-NAME (40 mg/kg) + Lisinopril (10 mg/kg). Treatment was daily and covered a period of 5 weeks. Blood pressure and electrocardiographic measurements were obtained using a non-invasive tail cuff blood pressure device and a 6/7 lead computer ECG equipment, respectively. Heart and kidney tissues were analyzed for oxidative stress parameters, and immunohistochemistry and histopathology of the heart and kidney were conducted using standard methods. L-NAME treatment led to a significant increase in diastolic and systolic values compared to the control group. Serum nitric oxide concentration significantly decreased in rats that received L-NAME alone, while co-treatment with MO and Lisinopril showed a significant increase in nitric oxide levels. Co-treatment with MO and Lisinopril significantly reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in the cardiac and renal tissues, whereas L-NAME alone caused a significant increase in MDA concentration. The expressions of cardiac and renal caspase-3 significantly increased in L-NAME alone treated rats, while co-treatments with MO and Lisinopril significantly reduced the expressions of caspase-3. In conclusion, co-treatment with MO effectively reduced arterial pressure and indices of hypertension in rats, mitigated the oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by L-NAME. Therefore, the inclusion of MO seeds in hypertension management may serve as an effective remedy. Keywords: Moringa oliefera, L-NAME, Hypertension, Oxidative Stress, Nitric oxide.",

      "abstract": "Moringa oleifera (MO) has gained recognition as a potent natural intervention for preventing and managing chronic diseases (CDs) due to its diverse phytochemical composition and pharmacological properties. Rich in antioxidants, polyphenols, flavonoids, and glucosinolates, MO exerts anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperglycemic, cardioprotective, and anti-obesity effects. These properties make it a valuable therapeutic agent for CDs, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer. MO's ability to modulate oxidative stress and inflammation-key drivers of CDs-highlights its significant role in disease prevention and treatment. MO enhances insulin sensitivity, regulates lipid profiles and blood pressure, reduces inflammation, and protects against oxidative damage. MO also modulates key signaling pathways involved in cancer and liver disease prevention. Studies suggest that MO extracts possess anticancer activity by modulating apoptosis, inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, and interacting with key signaling pathways, including YAP/TAZ, Nrf2-Keap1, TLR4/NF-κB, and Wnt/β-catenin. However, challenges such as variability in bioactive compounds, taste acceptability, and inconsistent clinical outcomes limit their widespread application. While preclinical studies support its efficacy, large-scale clinical trials, standardized formulations, and advanced delivery methods are needed to optimize its therapeutic potential. MO's multifunctional applications make it a promising and sustainable solution for combating chronic diseases, especially in resource-limited settings."

      "abstract": "In the last decades, plant extracts have received great attention. In particular, many studies pointed out the potential neuroprotective effect of polyphenols-rich extracts from plants. Evidence indeed highlights the action of polyphenols, both as antioxidants and as inhibitors in the formation of amyloid protein aggregates, known to be involved in neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, aqueous extracts obtained at high and room temperature from leaves of Moringa oleifera (MO) harvested in Sicily were characterized for polyphenolic content, anti-oxidative and free radical scavenging capacity. UHPLC-HESI-MS analysis shows that both water extracts are rich in terms of polyphenols. Then, MO aqueous extracts were tested as inhibitors in the amyloid aggregation process of Amyloid β-peptide 1-42 (Aβ1-42). This peptide is strongly involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD), its overproduction and aggregated species being considered a hallmark of AD. Results show that MO extracts cause a strong inhibition on the amyloid process. Biophysical characterization of the extracts reveals the presence of stable polyphenol assemblies. Both free and aggregated polyphenols elicit an efficient inhibition mechanism held up by their ability to interact with metastable species, strongly hindering autocatalytic amyloid growth. Finally, the effects of the MO room temperature extract have been tested on an AD cell model, retinoic acid-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells challenged with glyceraldehyde (GA). Cell pretreatment with MO extract results in an improved cell viability in comparison with the control and furthermore in the reduction of both mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and GA-stimulated Aβ1-42 production."

      "abstract": "Moringa oleifera Lam (MO) is a member of the Moringaceae family and has been widely used as a traditional form of treatment for various diseases due to its high nutrient content. The plant is rich in vitamins, minerals, organic acids, phenolic compounds, polyphenols, alkaloids, and flavonoids. However, the concentrations of these components in each part of the plant differ, leading to specific beneficial uses. In this study, we aimed to analyze the contents of Moringa oleifera leaf (ML) and Moringa oleifera root (MR) extracts and characterize the effects of these extracts on cell behavior. HPLC analysis data showed a higher level of flavonoids and apigenin in the ML extract compared to the MR extract. Furthermore, CG/MS analysis revealed 54 components in the ML extract, with only 3 (ethyl palmitate, ethyl linolenate, and palmitic acid, 2-(octadecyloxy)ethyl ester) of them being at high levels. In this study, Dictyostelium discoideum was used as a cellular model and D. discoideum's cell growth, chemotaxis, and development life cycle were investigated. The data presented herein demonstrate a significant decrease in cell growth and that the completion of the development life cycle was delayed in the ML extract-treated sample. This effect was not found in the untreated cells and MR extract-treated samples. In addition, the ability of cells to stream during chemotaxis was not inhibited following treatments. These findings suggested that ML extract has an impact on cell proliferation and cell directed migration processes, where the high level of flavonoids and apigenin in this extract can be a strong factor that led to these results."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) hold significant promise in lung cancer treatment due to their unique physicochemical properties, enabling targeted drug delivery, enhanced therapeutic efficacy, and reduced systemic toxicity. This study is aimed to produce the Au-NPs utilising Moringa oleifera and evaluate their effectiveness in the treatment of lung cancer, with a specific focus on A549 cell lines. METHODS: The synthesis of Au-NPs was carried out by combining 10 mL of an aqueous extract of M. oleifera with 190 mL of a 1 mM HAuCl4 solution. The synthesized Au-NPs were characterised using several microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. The evaluation of the median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of Au-NPs and its impact on apoptosis was conducted through the measurement of caspase activation and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Anti-cancer characteristics was conducted by employing DAPI staining. Furthermore, the influence on ROS production and mitochondrial membrane potential was evaluated at the IC50 concentration using fluorescence microscopy, employing DCFH-DA and Rhodamine 123 dyes. RESULTS: The synthesis of Au-NPs was confirmed through UV-Vis spectroscopy, with an absorbance peak at 540 nm. FTIR, TEM results showed that the M. oleifera mediated Au-NPs had a spherical morphology, and their mean size was approximately 30 nm, as determined by DLS. The Au-NPs exhibited an IC50 value of 50 μg/mL against the A549 lung cancer cells. The DAPI staining results revealed that both concentrations of AuNP, 25 μg/mL and 50 μg/mL, exhibited noteworthy anti-cancer and apoptotic properties. DISCUSSION: The study demonstrates that M. oleifera-mediated Au-NPs exhibit significant cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on A549 lung cancer cells, with an IC50 value of 50 μg/mL. Both tested concentrations showed substantial anti-cancer properties, as confirmed by DAPI staining. The unique focus on lung cancer, specifically the A549 cell line, sets this study apart from others that address a broader spectrum of cancer types. These findings suggest that M. oleifera-mediated Au-NPs hold promise for clinical applications in lung cancer treatment, providing a potential new therapeutic application."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lead intoxication triggers testicular toxicity via oxidative stress. AIM: This study aimed to explore the antioxidant potential of Moringa oleifera leaf extract (MOLE) in enhancing the semen quality of rats exposed to lead acetate. METHODS: Twenty-five healthy rats were randomly and equally divided into five groups. Group C served as the negative control, whereas group C+ was exposed to lead acetate at 50-mg/kg body weight (BW)/day without MOLE. The T1, T2, and T3 groups were exposed to lead acetate at 50-mg/kg BW and concurrently received MOLE at doses of 200-, 316-, and 500-mg/kg BW/day, respectively, for 20 days. On the 21st day, all rats were euthanized for blood collection and testicle harvesting. RESULTS: The result showed that exposure to lead acetate at 50-mg/kg BW/day in group C+ led to significant decreases (p < 0.05) in superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels, plasma membrane integrity, Leydig and Sertoli cell counts, spermatozoa numbers, sperm motility, and live spermatozoa, as well as significant increases (p < 0.05) in malondialdehyde levels and apoptotic and necrotic sperm, compared with control group C-. The administration of MOLE to rats exposed to lead acetate resulted in improvement in all of these variables. However, SOD and testosterone levels, as well as spermatozoa numbers, viability, apoptosis, and necrosis, did not recover in group T3 (p < 0.05) compared with control group C-. CONCLUSION: MOLE effectively restores sperm quality in lead acetate-induced rats.",

      "abstract": "Crystal violet (CV), a widely used dye in paints and textiles, poses a significant environmental threat due to its non-biodegradable nature. A modified slag-based geopolymer has been developed to address this issue by incorporating raw moringa seed powder (MSP), an agricultural waste. The geopolymers (SM1, SM2, and SM3) were created by adding different percentages of MSP (0.2%, 0.6%, and 1% by weight) to ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), using sodium silicate and 10 M sodium hydroxide as alkali activators. This combination enhances the geopolymer's mechanical and adsorbent properties, making it more effective for CV removal. The geopolymer composites were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Their mechanical properties were evaluated by conducting compressive strength and total porosity tests. Pore structure analysis was performed using nitrogen adsorption and desorption techniques, and the point of zero charges was determined. Additionally, batch experiments were carried out to investigate the adsorption of CV dye, employing two isotherm models and kinetic models for analysis. The SM1 mix, which is a modified slag-based geopolymer containing 0.2% MSP, exhibited the highest compressive strength at 73 MPa after 180 days, representing a 25.8% improvement compared to the control mix (100% slag). Furthermore, modified geopolymer mixes showed greater adsorption activity toward crystal violet compared to the control mix, with the SM3 mix achieving an adsorption capacity of up to 322.58 mg/g. The study demonstrates that adding MSP to slag-based geopolymer enhances mechanical strength and adsorption capacity. This indicates a positive impact on the composite's surface properties and highlights the environmental benefits of utilizing industrial and agricultural waste in wastewater treatment."

      "abstract": "The issue of water contamination has gotten worse worldwide due to industrialization and population increase. The wastewater discharge techniques used by Ethiopia's textile sector do not comply with the national discharge standard. Because the discharge of inadequately treated or untreated textile effluent into the environment is becoming more frequent. Thus, minimizing this trend's harm to the environment requires using the best wastewater treatment technology. Coagulation is considered one of the most effective methods for treating textile wastewaters, which technically need to have a natural or artificial coagulant added to eliminate dangerous pollutants. Nonetheless, criticism has been leveled against the use of chemical coagulants due to their serious disadvantages. This has led to an interest in substituting natural materials for chemical coagulants. The main objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of various powders and Moringa seed cactus pad powders when employed as a natural coagulant to clean up textile effluent. Moringa seeds and cactus pad consist of proteins (cationic and dimeric) which help in neutralizing and absorbing colloidal charges in water containing suspended solids. To examine the impacts of various operating parameters, including coagulant dose, pH, and mixing time, as well as the ideal coagulation conditions, experiments were conducted using a jar testing system. The ideal parameters were pH 4, 5 g/l of coagulant, 40 min of mixing time, 2 min of fast mixing at 100 rpm, 40 min of gradual mixing at 40 rpm, and 30 min of settling time. Under these ideal circumstances, 82.33 Moreover, cactus pad powder reduced turbidity by 53.16 %, TDS by 97 %, BOD by 58.75 %, COD by 25.37 %, Conductivity by 60 %, and TSS by 56.33 %. Therefore, using Cactus pad as a natural coagulant is advised. Rather than using Moringa seed, it efficiently eliminates turbidity, TDS, and TSS from wastewater effluents from the textile sector. Eventually, one of the natural coagulants employed in the coagulation process, Cactus pad, proved to be useful and was chosen."

The research compared full irrigation (100% ETc) with water deficit conditions (60% ETc). While water deficit negatively impacted plant growth, yield, and various physiological parameters, the sequential application of Nano-Zn (at 50 or 100 mg L-1) with MLE (3%) significantly mitigated these adverse effects. The combined treatment proved more effective than individual applications, enhancing growth parameters, photosynthetic efficiency, and antioxidant systems. The treatment particularly improved stress tolerance by increasing protective compounds like soluble sugars and amino acids while reducing harmful H2O2 levels. The study concluded that sequential application of 100 mg L-1 Nano-Zn with MLE was optimal for enhancing squash performance under drought stress, with 50 mg L-1 Nano-Zn plus MLE as the second-best option."

Based on these findings, further studies were conducted to investigate the effects of heat treatment on the allergenicity, particle size, zeta potential, total sulfhydryl (TSH) content, hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, ultraviolet spectrum, and intrinsic fluorescence spectrum of M. oleifera leaf protein. Additionally, in vitro digestion experiments were carried out to gain further insights into the protein's behavior under these conditions. The experiment simulated the alterations in M. oleifera leaf protein during the processes of cooking and digestion. The findings of this experiment can provide certain guidance for the processing of M. oleifera leaf products. The hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, transmembrane region, antigen index, calcium binding site, spatial structure, and homology of M. oleifera leaf fructose 1,6 bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) were simulated and calculated based on the amino acid sequence of the 36 kDa allergen. These parameters collectively serve to indicate the allergenic activity of the peptide. The findings of the analysis align with the outcomes of the sensitization experiments, suggesting that the FBA of M. oleifera leaves is indeed consistent. In conjunction with the heat treatment experiments, this research can inform the preparation of M. oleifera leaf foods and provide a foundation for further investigation into M. oleifera leaf allergens.",

      "abstract": "Postharvest flowering Chinese cabbage is prone to rapid senescence and quality deterioration during storage at room temperature. The imbalance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism is one of the critical factors leading to this process. In this study, we synthesized Moringa oleifera leaf-derived carbon dots (MoCDs) and investigated the effects of MoCDs treatment on ROS metabolism regulation for postharvest flowering Chinese cabbage preservation. The results showed that MoCDs exhibited more efficient antioxidant activity than M. oleifera extract, attributed to their abundant surface functional groups, including hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino groups, and an extensive sp2-hybridized carbon network. Moreover, MoCDs treatment could reduce the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion radical in postharvest flowering Chinese cabbage by generally enhancing the activities of a series of key antioxidant enzymes and increasing the contents of non-enzymatic antioxidants, which significantly delayed leaf senescence and deterioration of appearance and nutritional quality of postharvest flowering Chinese cabbage during storage. In summary, as an effective antioxidant, MoCDs entered leaf cells to scavenge excessive ROS directly; as an elicitor, MoCDs enhanced the ROS scavenging ability of the endogenous antioxidant defense system in postharvest flowering Chinese cabbage. These dual protective mechanisms synergistically regulated ROS metabolism, thus benefiting the postharvest preservation of flowering Chinese cabbage.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Salinity is a major threat to rice growth and productivity. Utilizing wild rice-derived genes and biostimulants with high growth promoting- and stress-alleviating potential can significantly improve salinity tolerance in cultivated rice. Herein, we investigated the vegetative growth and physiological responses of Giza 177 (Oryza sativa, salinity sensitive, high-yielding cultivar) and a promising introgression salt tolerant line (sativa/glaberrima; SG 65) from a population of Giza 177 × African rice (Oryza glaberrima) under low (2.75 mS/cm) and high (5.5 mS/cm) salinity stress. The possible ameliorative effects of priming rice seeds in moringa leaf extract (MLE) on these responses were also tested. RESULTS: The two salinity levels induced differential reduction in plant growth in both cultivars. In the MLE-unprimed plants, salinity induced 34-54% and 30-45% reductions in biomass accumulation in Giza 177 and SG 65, respectively. These responses were associated with significant differential reductions in relative water content, chlorophylls, carotenoids, and gas exchange parameters (transpiration rate, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and intercellular CO2 concentration), ascorbic acid, and total protein. Conversely, salinity induced the accumulation of H2O2, malondialdehyde, proline, carbohydrate fractions, and membrane injury. MLE treatment mitigated the above salinity-induced adverse effects in both cultivars via reducing the salt-induced oxidative stress through the induction of non-enzymic (total phenols, and flavonoids) and enzymic antioxidants including ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase in both cultivars. SG 65 plants exhibited consistently higher salt tolerance and responsiveness to MLE than Giza 177. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports significant differences in an array of critical physiological and biochemical indices that underpin the divergent responses between the two salinized cultivars. It demonstrates the potential of African rice-derived genomic fragments and MLE priming in mitigating salinity stress, highlighting their use as a sustainable strategy for increasing rice production in salt-affected soils.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Migraine, a common disorder marked by severe and repetitive headaches, has been linked to the involvement of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR), a receptor responsible for glutamate signaling. Moringa oleifera (M. oleifera), recognized for its anti-inflammatory properties and therapeutic potential in various conditions, has been investigated. This study aims to assess the efficacy and precise mechanisms of M. oleifera for the treatment of migraine, for which evidence is limited. METHODS: Rats were stratified into four distinct groups. The control group did not undergo the migraine-induction protocol. Post-induction, the \"sumatriptan\" group was administered sumatriptan injections, the \"treatment\" group received oral M. oleifera extract, and the \"vehicle\" group was provided with oral solvent treatment. Behavioral evaluations encompassing Von Frey's and hot plate assessments, in addition to qPCR analysis targeting Nr2a, Nr2b, Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase-3, were conducted. RESULTS: Von Fery's and hot plate tests revealed a notable decrease in triggering pressure and temperature within the vehicle group when compared to the other groups (both ps < 0.001). The Nr2a expression levels in both the vehicle and treatment cohorts exhibited significantly higher values than those observed in the control group (p < 0.001, p = 0.001) and the sumatriptan group (p < 0.001, p = 0.002). Conversely, no substantial alterations in Nr2b or Bcl-2 expression levels were observed across the study groups (p = 0.404, p = 0.976). Notably, heightened expressions of Caspase-3 and Bax were evident in the vehicle group relative to the other groups (p = 0.013, p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Moringa oleifera extract appears to mitigate symptoms of migraine by inhibiting apoptosis, suggesting potential efficacy in migraine treatment; however, additional research investigating a wider range of pathways is necessary.

      "abstract": "The urgent need to address the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance in multidrug-resistant bacteria requires the development of pioneering approaches to treatment. The present study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of the essential oils (EOs) of Moringa oleifera (moringa), Cinnamomum verum (cinnamon), and Nigella sativa (black seed) and the synergistic effect of the mixture of these oils against Staphylococcus aureus MCC 1351. Statistical modeling revealed cinnamon oil had the highest individual antimicrobial potency, followed by black seed oil. The combination of the three EOs exhibited significant synergistic effects compared to the individual oils, with a Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (∑FIC) index of 0.27. L-Optimal mixture design of response surface methodology (RSM) identified the optimal mixture as moringa: cinnamon: black seed oils by the ratio of (1:1:1) in run 15 (0.338:0.307:0.355 mL) (v/v). This mixture exhibited significant antibacterial efficacy, outperforming individual oils and conventional antibiotics like tetracycline. Specifically, the combination reduced the MIC values from 3.12, 0.78, and 6.25 to 0.25, 0.06, and 0.78 μg/mL for moringa, cinnamon, and black seed oil, respectively. Synergistic interactions between oils further boosted efficacy, with moringa-cinnamon and cinnamon-black seed pairings exhibiting the strongest synergies. The developed predictive models for IZD and MIC showed excellent fit, with R2 values of 0.9843 and 0.9958, respectively. Pareto chart analysis highlighted the predominant individual and synergistic effects, with the Moringa-Cinnamon interaction exhibiting the highest positive synergy. Notably, the oil mixture of run 15 demonstrated excellent biocompatibility, maintaining 97.6% viability of normal human skin fibroblasts (HSF) after 24 h exposure to 200 μL EOs of the mixture per mL. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) identified abundant bioactive phytochemicals like cinnamaldehyde, linoleic acid, and palmitic acid methyl esters underlying the observed antimicrobial effects. This rationally designed, synergistic phytochemical combination presents a promising natural therapeutic against antibiotic-resistant S. aureus while exhibiting minimal cytotoxicity. The results underscore how combining essential oils could help address the issue of antibiotic resistance in S. aureus."

Sows and their piglets are particularly vulnerable to HS, as the periparturient phase is characterized by heightened metabolism and increased oxidative stress and inflammation. The study examined the effects of using conductive electronic cooling pads (ECP) and dietary supplementation with 4% Moringa (M) leaf powder on controlling oxidative stress and inflammation caused by HS in sows and their piglets. Forty-eight late gestation sows were assigned to four treatment groups: HS-fed corn-soybean meal (HS + CS), ECP-fed corn-soybean meal (ECP + CS), HS + M, and ECP + M. Blood was collected from sows on gestation (G) day 112, and lactation (L) day 14 and L20, and from piglets (2 males and 2 females) in each litter on postnatal (PN) day 1 and PN20. Colostrum was collected within 2h of birth of the first neonate, and mature milk was collected on L14. Piglet fecal samples were collected on PN14 to measure calprotectin concentration as a marker of intestinal inflammation. Biological antioxidant potential (BAP), derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites (dROMs). and oxidative stress index (OSi) were measured in blood and milk samples using a Free Radical Elective Evaluator. Milk samples pooled by day of lactation and treatment group were analyzed using cytokine array. Levels of inflammatory cytokines in colostrum were affected by Moringa supplementation and cooling, but not mature milk. Notably, the anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-1ra were 2.14 and 1.57 Log2 higher in the colostrum of HS + M compared to other groups. The OSi of colostrum was higher (P = 0.0002) than mature milk. Level of BAP in sow serum was greater in ECP + CS and HS + M (P = 0.0291) compared to other groups. Moringa had an overall effect of increasing dROMs (P = 0.0035) and levels of OSi were lowest in ECP + CS (P = 0.0296) sow serum. Treatments did not affect piglet serum oxidative index (P > 0.05) or calprotectin levels (P > 0.05). Findings support further studies to investigate the efficacy of using ECP and Moringa supplementation to mitigate inflammation and oxidative stress imposed by heat stress conditions in lactating sows."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Moringa peregrina, renowned for its extensive health benefits, continues to reveal its therapeutic potential through ongoing research. The synthesis of Moringa peregrina extract-selenium nanoparticles (MPE-SeNPs) has emerged as a promising approach in developing versatile therapeutic agents. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the protective effects of MPE-SeNPs against oxidative damage and inflammation caused by HgCl2 exposure in mice. METHODS: The study involved extracting and characterizing the dried powdered seeds of Moringa peregrina to determine their nutritional and bioactive contents. MPE-SeNPs were synthesized using plant extracts and characterized through TEM, UV-Vis, and FT-IR techniques to assess their chelating and superoxide radical scavenging activities. The LD50 of MPE-SeNPs was determined, and doses of 1/50 and 1/20 of the LD50 were administered to HgCl₂-exposed mice to evaluate lung protective effects. Biochemical analyses measured plasma lipid profiles and lung antioxidant status, while gene expression of TGF-β1, P38, and NF-kβ in lung tissue was analyzed. Histopathological examinations of lung tissues were conducted to observe structural changes and fibrosis, providing a comprehensive assessment of the protective efficacy of MPE-SeNPs against oxidative damage and inflammation. RESULTS: The raw Moringa peregrine seeds contain approximately 27.81% fat, 32.10% protein, 13.11% fiber, 4.11% ash and 22.93% carbohydrate content. The phenolic and flavonoid content in debittered seeds is approximately 76.42 mg of GAE/g DE), and 15.55 mg of QE/g DE, respectively. However, MPE and MPESeNPs exhibited chelating activity with 54 and 80.64% after 60 min. Additionally, at a concentration of 120 μg/mL, the superoxide radical scavenging activity was 71% for MPE and 93% for MPE-SeNPs after 5 minutes of incubation. The IC50 values recorded for MPE and MPE-SeNPs were 80.38 and 48.01 μg/mL, respectively. MPE-SeNPs had an average size of approximately 130.63 nm. UV-Vis spectrum peaks and FTIR identified functional groups associated with phenolics and flavonoids. LD50 of MPE-SeNPs was estimated to be 773 mg/kg body weight. Oral administration of MPE and MPE-SeNPs led to improvements in plasma lipid profile as well as lung antioxidant status. Moreover, downregulation of lung TGF-β1, P38, and NF-kβ gene expression in HgCl2-intoxicated mice when treated with MPE-SeNPs. In addition, MPE-SeNPs improve lung tissue by enhancing antioxidant enzymes, suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines, and scavenging free radicals. CONCLUSION: The study reveals that Moringa peregrina extract combined with selenium nanoparticles (MPESeNPs) offers significant protection against oxidative damage induced by HgCl₂ exposure. The enhanced antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of MPE-SeNPs, particularly at a dose of 38.65 mg/kg body weight, demonstrate their potential as a powerful natural therapy for pulmonary fibrosis. These findings underscore the promise of MPE-SeNPs in improving lung health by mitigating oxidative stress, reducing inflammation, and promoting tissue repair, paving the way for innovative treatments in respiratory medicine."

This study aimed to investigate the nutritional profiling through proximate analysis and the antipyretic activity of M. oleifera leaves, bark, and root in methanolic extract from different sites of Punjab, Pakistan. Methanolic extract of leaves, bark, and root from sites i to e of Southern Punjab, Central Punjab, and Northwest Punjab as S1, S2, and S3, respectively, at doses of 50, 100, and 150 mg/kg bw showed statistically significant results as compared to the positive and negative controls. The S1 leaves showed marvelous proximate compositions and antipyretic activity as a result of significantly lowering temperature as compared to the other methanolic leaves, bark, and root extracts of M. oleifera plant sample collected from other sites. The antipyretic activity of M. oleifera leaves, bark, and root was investigated using the standard reference drug paracetamol (200 mg/kg). The antipyretic activity was evaluated using baker's yeast-induced pyrexia. Obtained data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test and p < 0.05 was considered significant. The study showed that the methanolic extract of M. oleifera leaves possesses highest antipyretic activities as compared to bark and root which justifies its use as nutritional and traditional medicine in the treatment of fever."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:  The mechanical stimulation known as orthodontic mechanical force (OMF) causes biological reactions in orthodontic tooth movement (OTM). Heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70) needs pro-inflammatory cytokines to trigger bone resorption in OTM; nevertheless, heat shock protein-10 (HSP-10), a \"Alarmin\" cytokine, should control these pro-inflammatory cytokines to get the best alveolar bone remodeling (ABR). Moringa oleifera L. nanosuspension extract (MONE) has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and ABR-stimulating properties. The aim of the study was to examine in vivo HSP-10 and HSP-70 expressions under OMF following MONE application in Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus). MATERIAL AND METHODS:  A total of 36 Wistar rats (R. norvegicus) were split up into eight groups: one for treatment (OMF + MONE) and one for control (OMF + MONE administration for days 1, 7, 14, and 21). By employing nickel-titanium coil springs and using 10 g of light force per millimeter to implant the orthodontic device, the OMF was completed. According to the day of observation, all of the samples were sacrificed. To perform an immunohistochemistry investigation, the premaxilla of the sample was isolated. Tukey's Honest Significant Different (HSD) test (p < 0.05) was performed after an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) analysis of the data. RESULTS:  In both the OMF and MONE groups, HSP-70 peaked on day 14 and began to fall on day 21. HSP-10 peaked on day 21, but along with MONE, it also began to progressively decline on days 14 and 21, with significant differences (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION:  According to immunohistochemistry evidence, postadministration of MONE markedly elevated HSP-10 but lowered HSP-70 expression in the alveolar bone of Wistar rats under OMF."

      "abstract": "It is crucial to develop new tactics to prevent ovarian tissue damage in women whose reproductive toxicity is caused by chemotherapy. The present investigation was performed to assess the protective effects of Moringa oleifera (M. oleifera) leaf extract on cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced ovarian damage and reproductive dysfunction. Thirty-two female, healthy Wistar albino rats were randomly assigned to four groups (8 rats/group). The first group was given saline intraperitoneally (i.p.). The second group was given a single dose of CP (200 mg/kg; i.p.). The third and fourth groups were given M. oleifera leaf extract (150 and 250 mg/kg; orally) for 20 days before receiving CP on the final day of the experiment. Hormonal assessments, including follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estrogen (ES), were performed 24 h after CP administration. In addition, the antioxidant status and inflammatory response against CP were evaluated. Moreover, detailed histopathological and ultra- structural observations were conducted. For evaluation of statistical significance between different groups; One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's post hoc test was adopted. Our findings revealed that rats subjected to CP showed increased levels of FSH, LH, malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-8 and decreased levels of ES and glutathione. Pre-treatment with M. oleifera leaf extract (250 mg/kg; orally) was statistically significant (p values < 0.05) as it could improve hormonal changes, oxidative stress indices, and pro- inflammatory mediator levels. Consequently, a marked improvement was observed in the ovarian and uterine architectures, with a normal ovarian reserve and a normal endothelium with normal tubular glands. In conclusion, M. oleifera leaf extract (250 mg/kg) could be used as a pharmaceutical supplement because it protects female rats against CP-induced ovarian damage and reproductive dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Skeletal muscle tissue can regenerate after damage through the action of satellite cells, which proliferate as myoblasts when activated. Oxidative stress, marked by high rates of reactive oxygen species (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, H2O2), impairs this process by increasing myoblast cell death. Moringa oleifera leaf extract (MOLE), known for its antioxidant properties, was tested for its protective effects on C2C12 myoblasts under oxidative stress. We assessed MOLE's impact on total antioxidant capacity (TAC), glutathione homeostasis (GSH/GSSG), cell viability, and wound recovery. The metabolomic analysis of MOLE using an LC-MSMS ZenoTOF 7600 mass spectrometry system identified key compounds, including peculiar glucosinolates (42.1%) and flavonoids (18.8%), as well as phenolic acids (4.5%) and other significant metabolites (34.6%; among them, amino acids, vitamins, and fatty acids). H2O2 disrupted myoblast redox balance and caused cell death, but MOLE treatment restored the GSH/GSSG ratio, improved TAC, and increased cell viability. Additionally, MOLE promoted faster wound closure in myoblasts exposed to H2O2. These findings suggest that MOLE can protect C2C12 myoblasts by restoring redox balance and enhancing recovery under oxidative stress."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The traditional use of Moringa oleifera (MO), an essential food source in Africa and Asia, to cure various diseases dates back thousands of years. This study examines the aqueous and ethanolic leaf extracts of MO's in vitro anti-leukemia capabilities. METHODS: After preparing aqueous and ethanolic MO leaf extracts, cells were treated with various concentrations for 48 h. Cell viability was measured via MTT assay, and apoptotic pathways were analyzed using flow cytometry and Annexin V-PI staining. Following RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, cells were exposed to the IC50 (150 µg/ml) for 48 h. Real-time PCR assessed the expression of P21, P53, BCL2, and Survivin genes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) served as the control group. RESULTS: MO aqueous and ethanol extracts showed cytotoxicity, with cancer cells being more sensitive. Flow cytometry confirmed higher apoptotic activity in Jurkat and Raji cells compared to PBMCs. The extracts increased P21 expression in Jurkat cells but did not significantly affect P53, BCL2, or Survivin. Similarly, in Raji cells, P21, BCL2, and Survivin were elevated, while P53 remained unchanged. Gene expression in healthy PBMCs was unaffected by the extracts. CONCLUSION: This study shows that leukemia cells (Raji and Jurkat) are more sensitive to MO's aqueous and ethanolic extracts than healthy cells. The results suggest developing MO extracts as a cutting-edge leukemia treatment.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) derived from natural sources have garnered significant attention due to their unique properties and eco-friendly production methods. With lung cancer remaining a major global health issue, there is a continuous need for novel and effective therapeutic approaches beyond conventional treatments such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to synthesize AgNPs using plant extracts from Gymnema sylvestre, Moringa oleifera, and Azadirachta indica and to evaluate their anticancer activity, particularly their effects on gene expression in A549 lung cancer cells. METHODS: AgNPs were synthesized using green chemistry techniques and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Gene expression studies were performed to assess the impact of AgNPs on cancer-related genes such as VEGF and CYCLIN-D1. Cytotoxicity assays were conducted on A549 cells to determine the anticancer potential of the synthesized AgNPs compared to plant extracts alone. RESULTS: XRD confirmed the formation of crystalline AgNPs, while FTIR indicated the presence of bioactive compounds interacting with the nanoparticles. Gene expression analysis revealed significant downregulation of VEGF and CYCLIN-D1, suggesting inhibitory effects on angiogenesis and cell cycle progression. The synthesized AgNPs exhibited potent cytotoxic activity against A549 cells, with enhanced efficacy compared to the leaf extracts alone. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the potential of AgNPs synthesized from medicinal plant extracts as promising candidates for lung cancer therapy. Their environmentally sustainable production, combined with their ability to target key cancer pathways, positions them as innovative and affordable therapeutic agents in the field of nanomedicine.",

In recent decades, research has been directed to alternative production of cheaper sustainable ecofriendly adsorbents with low carbon footprints. Moringa oleifera as an example for terrestrial plant and Eichhornia crassipes commonly known as water hyacinth (WH) as an aquatic plant, are simple effective natural and powerful adsorbents for heavy metals removal. Both plants have invasive growth tendency. They can be easily utilized in developed communities and in rural areas to produce clean water. This review is a comprehensive summary of M. oleifera (MO) and E. crassipes (WH) uses in impure water treatments with a particular attention to their role in reducing carbon footprint.

Also, there was a significant effect on cytotoxicity against a breast cell line when the ethanolic extract was combined with doxorubicin. At the molecular level, changes in gene expression were detected via qPCR. Thirty-two compounds were identified in the ethanolic extract using HPLC ESI-MS/MS and classified into: hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, flavonoids, fatty acids, and other miscellaneous compounds. Molecular docking predicted that the main component in the ethanolic extract (apigenin-7-O-rutinoside) has multiple inhibitory effects on MDR-1, Raf-1 and Top-II proteins."

      "abstract": "Sodium valproate- a salt of valproic acid (VPA), is an anticonvulsant used in the treatment of epilepsy and a range of psychiatric conditions that include panic attacks, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, migraine and bipolar disorder etc. VPA can cause direct damage to many tissues due to accumulation of toxic metabolites. Nowadays, phytochemicals are amongst the best options for the treatment of diseases. Moringa oleifera is a popular plant in the tropics owing to its numerous pharmacological and phytochemical properties such as antiproliferative, hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and cardioprotective effects. In the present study, the protective effects of Moringa ethanol extract on oxidative lung damage caused by VPA was assessed biochemically and histologically. Sprague Dawley female rats were divided into 4 groups: Control, Moringa extract (M), sodium valproate (V), and sodium valproate + Moringa extract (V + M). Doses of sodium valproate and Moringa extract (dissolved in physiological saline) were given at 500 mg/kg b.w. and 300 mg/kg b.w. for 15 days, respectively. The rats were sacrificed on the 16th day, lung tissues collected biochemical parameters (glutathione level, antioxidant enzyme activities, oxidative stress biomarker and inflammatory proteins) and histopathological findings obtained from the study indicated increased damage in lung tissue of the valproate administered group. The damage was prevented/decreased upon administration of Moringa to the valproate rats. The present findings revealed that Moringa extract had a protective and therapeutic effect against VPA induced lung damage. Moringa extract demonstrated an ameliorative effect on histopathological and biochemical parameters in valproate induced lung damage.",

The use of chemical coagulants in water treatment presents environmental and health risks due to their non-biodegradable byproducts, which contaminate ecosystems. Natural coagulants offer a safer alternative, as they decompose naturally and reduce pollution. However, their production often requires complex methods, such as microfiltration and lyophilization, which are unsuitable for resource-limited areas. This study introduces a simplified method for producing a natural coagulant from the seeds of Moringa oleifera, eliminating the need for complex techniques or saline solutions. The process involves peeling, grinding the seeds, stirring with water, and filtering through paper filters, producing the coagulant in under 30 min. Coagulation tests showed complete turbidity removal with 5 mL of coagulant per liter of water at 100 NTU. This economical and environmentally sustainable method offers a practical solution for improving water treatment in resource-limited communities. •Simplified production method for Moringa oleifera-based coagulant without complex techniques or chemical additives.•Coagulant production is completed in <30 min, compared to hours or days in alternative methods.•Achieves 100 % turbidity removal using only 5 mL of coagulant per liter of water in coagulation tests."

      "abstract": "Lactating sows and their litters are particularly vulnerable to heat stress (HS). HS decreases fertility, feed intake, milk production, and litter growth of sows. Approaches are needed to mitigate the negative effects of HS on animal welfare and oxidative damage to tissues. The objective of this study was to measure the efficacy of conductive heat removal using electronic cooling pads (ECP) and feeding Moringa oleifera (4% of the diet, M), a feedstuff high in antioxidants, to sows from late gestation to weaning on their welfare and production performance. A study was conducted using a 2 × 2 factorial design of treatments, with mixed parity Yorkshire × Landrace sows (n = 48). The sows were exposed to moderate HS conditions from gestation day 110 to day 21 of lactation. To achieve moderate HS, the farrowing room temperature was increased incrementally daily from 25 °C to 32 °C between 0800 and 1100 hours and decreased from 32 °C to 26 °C between 1700 and 2000 hours. Sows were limit fed during gestation (1.36 kg 2X/d) and fed ad libitum post farrowing. Treatments included HS + control corn-soybean meal (CS)-based diet (HS + CS), HS + M, ECP + CS, ECP + M (n = 12/treatment). Sow respiration rate (RR) and rectal temperature (RT) were measured four times daily (0600, 1300, 1600, and 1900 hours). The use of ECP decreased lactating sow RR (HS = 66.6 bpm, ECP = 28.3 bpm, P < 0.0001), RT (HS = 39.2 °C, ECP = 38.8 °C, P = 0.003), and lactation body weight (BW) loss (HS = -21.67 kg, ECP = -5.1 kg P = 0.002). ECP by time-of-day interactions (P < 0.01) existed for RR and RT, with ECP having a greater impact from 1300 to 1900 hours, than at 0600 hours. ECP increased the intake of lactation feed (P = 0.02). An ECP by diet interaction (P = 0.0004) indicated that ECP increased the intake of lactation feed for the sows fed the CS diet (6.48 vs. 4.42 kg/d, P = 0.0004), but did not affect the feed intake of sows fed the M diet. The treatment did not affect litter weaning weight (P = 0.14). Moringa increased percent fat in milk (M = 12.28%, CS = 11.06%, P = 0.05). The reduction in sow RR and RT, and increase in feed intake with lower loss of BW indicate that ECP improved sow well-being in the HS environment. Neither ECP nor M affected litter growth, despite M increasing fat content of milk and ECP-CS increasing feed intake.",

      "abstract": "Moringa oleifera (M. oleifera) is a plant with significant medicinal and nutritional value and contains various bioactive compounds, particularly in its leaves (MOL). This study sought to explore the impact of M. oleifera leaf polysaccharides (MOLPs) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated intestinal epithelial cells (IEC6) and to uncover the mechanisms involved. The cytotoxicity of MOLP on IEC6 cells was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, which demonstrated a safe concentration range of 0-1280 µg/mL. The impact of MOLP on cell viability was further evaluated over 12 to 48 h. IEC6 cells were treated with three concentrations of MOLP low (25 µg/mL), medium (50 µg/mL), and high (100 µg/mL) alongside LPS (50 µg/mL) stimulation for one day. The findings revealed that treatment with MOLP significantly promoted cell migration and increased the production of interleukin-10 (IL-10), while it simultaneously decreased cell apoptosis and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Additionally, MOLP treatments across all concentrations significantly reduced the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa B-alpha (pIκB-α), and phosphorylated NF-κB p65 signalling pathways. Moreover, MOLP restored the expression of tight junction proteins, such as zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin, which had been disrupted by LPS. These results indicate that MOLP exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting inflammatory signalling pathways and maintaining intestinal barrier integrity through the upregulation of tight junction proteins in IEC6 cells. This study enhances our understanding of the anti-inflammatory capabilities of MOLP."

      "abstract": "Bacterial resistance to antibiotics remains a significant clinical challenge, contributing to persistently high rates of morbidity and mortality. Achieving treatment success is increasingly difficult, necessitating the evaluation of new antibiotics and complementary approaches, including source control and alternative therapies. This study aimed to investigate the antibacterial, antioxidant, cytotoxic, and phytochemical properties of Moringa oleifera leaf extract using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of its major compound. The extract demonstrated strong antibacterial activity against standard strains and foodborne bacterial species. It also showed significant antioxidant potential, supported by the presence of high concentrations of phenolic and flavonoid compounds. HPLC analysis identified multiple bioactive compounds, with quercetin as the predominant component. The cytotoxicity study confirmed the safety of the extract at low and moderate concentrations, and ADMET analysis indicated favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics of quercetin. In conclusion, Moringa oleifera exhibits promising potential for medical and food industry applications due to its significant antibacterial and antioxidant activities, combined with a strong safety profile and rich phytochemical content.",

      "abstract": "Moringa oleifera (M. oleifera) is a popular medicinal plant that has become a wide research area in recent years due to its detected biological effects and its bioactive compounds. Valproic acid (VPA) is a medication used in the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder and high doses or prolonged use of VPA can result in oxidative stress in cells. Since M. oleifera has high biological activities and contains many bioactive compounds, it is necessary to understand whether it plays a role in reducing oxidative damage, especially that caused VPA. The relationship between VPA and tongue tissue needs to be investigated, since VPA has negative effects on oral health and it is known that tongue tissue plays an important role in the continuity of oral health. In the present study, 3.0-3.5 month-old female Sprague Dawley rats (160-250 g) were divided into four groups (Control, Moringa, VPA, VPA + M), and VPA was administered via gavage. The aim was to understand the protective/preventive effects of ethanolic M. oleifera leaves extract against oxidative stress through biochemical parameters. Additionally, molecular docking studies were conducted on niazicin-A, niazimin-A, and niazimin-B found in M. oleifera leaves based on in vivo results. The results indicate that M. oleifera extract treats oxidative damage to the tongue tissue, and niazimin-A and niazimin-B particularly show high binding affinities to myeloperoxidase (MPO) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzymes. Further studies may suggest that the use of M. oleifera leaves extract with VPA could prevent potential negative effects on tongue tissue.",

They have various medicinal uses, including treating diabetes, anemia, inflammation, dermatological issues, backaches, cold, flu, and gastrointestinal problems. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge about natural products found in The Bahamas that can be used to treat diabetes mellitus. The search terms \"Moringa oleifera Lam.,\" \"Swietenia mahagoni (L.),\" \"Momordica charantia L.,\" \"Tecoma stans,\" \"Persea americana,\" \"Psidium guajava,\" \"Hamelia patens,\" and \"Carica papaya L.\" in combination with \"diabetes\" were utilized to obtain pertinent data by searching PubMed and Google Scholar. Moringa oleifera Lam. significantly decreased fasting glucose levels in rodents after 3 months of consumption. The ethanolic extract of S. mahagoni seeds and the methanol extract of its bark can decrease blood glucose levels. Momordica charantia L. and H. patens Jacq. produce the same hypoglycemic effects as metformin. The plant extracts and compounds of T. stans (L.) Juss. ex Kunth, P. americana Mill., P. guajava L., and C. papaya L. showed diverse pharmacological activities such as reducing fasting glucose, lowering blood pressure and blood sugar, decreasing total triglycerides and total cholesterol, and improving structural damage of cardiac muscles caused by diabetes. Literature analysis reveals that the diverse pharmacological activities of various plants native to The Bahamas show promise as a medicinal food in the treatment of diabetes.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: It is desirable to rehabilitate desert ecosystems with a selection of native plant species that render ecosystem services and yield natural products for creating a high-value industry, e.g., pharmaceuticals or cosmetics. However, plant growth under arid and hyper-arid conditions, such as in the Arabian Peninsula, is constrained by heat, freshwater scarcity, and alkaline sandy soils with low nutrient and water holding capacity. Therefore, it is imperative to develop nature-based sustainable technologies to improve arid soil conditions, as well as increase irrigation and nutrient-use eficiency. METHODS: Here, we report on a study evaluating the effects of two complementary soil amendment technologies, namely Superhydrophobic sand (SHS) mulch and engineered biochar (EB) on the growth of Moringa oleifera plants. Effects of SHS (1cm-thick), EB (2% w/w), and SHS+EB treatments were tracked in greenhouse plants under normal (N, 100% field capacity) and reduced (R, 50% of N) irrigation scenarios for over 150 days, where EB treatments were pre-loaded with nutrients and remaining treatments received traditional NPK fertilizer. RESULTS: Significant benefits of the SHS, EB, and SHS+EB treatments were found in terms of increased plant height, trunk diameter, leaf area, leaf chlorophyll content index, stomatal conductance, and shoot and root biomass in comparison with the controls. Evaporation water savings due to SHS mulching significantly enhanced transpiration under N and R scenarios. Similarly, EB and SHS+EB treated plants experienced higher transpiration than in the control plants under N and R conditions (p< 0.05). In response to water stress due to excessive evaporation, metabolomics analysis showed a higher accumulation of amino acids in control plants than other treatments under both irrigation regimes. Meanwhile, a higher abundance of sugars (i.e., D-Mannose, D-Fructose, glucose) and organic acid (i.e., malic acid) was observed in SHS and EB-treatments for Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) scores >1.0 (i.e., the scores considered of significance in contributing to the differences between treatment groups). DISCUSSION: The results show the synergistic benefits of SHS and EB technologies for addressing the challenges of water scarcity and nutrient limitation in arid regions, which couldcontribute to the success and sustainability of agriculture and greening efforts in such regions."

METHODS: The effects of M. oleifera hydroalcoholic bark extract (MOHE) on different parameters influencing diabetic wound healing were comprehensively investigated including: anti-inflammatory effects, antibacterial properties, antioxidant activity, anti-diabetic properties, and fibroblast proliferation and migration. Furthermore, in vivo studies were conducted in diabetic rats and Zebrafish to investigate the topical effects of MOHE on wound healing. RESULTS: The findings of this study demonstrated that MOHE has strong anti-diabetic effect, including a significant inhibition of α-amylase activity (IC50 = 0.043 mg/mL) and 2.92-fold increase in 2-NBDG uptake in McCoy cells. MOHE demonstrated considerable antioxidant activity, inhibiting DPPH (IC50: 0.046 mg/mL) and ABTS (IC50: 0.04 mg/mL) free radicals. In in vitro wound healing studies employing MOHE revealed a significant increase in McCoy fibroblast proliferation (148.83%) and improved migration, resulting in a wound closure rate of 46.3%. MOHE exhibited significant antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria species. It efficiently reduced heat-induced RBC hemolysis, with anti-inflammatory effect of 73% at 0.2 mg/mL. Furthermore, MOHE demonstrated better results in the treatment of diabetic wounds in Wistar rats and fin regeneration in Zebra fish compared to Calendula cream. CONCLUSION: This evidence based pharmacological study highlights the promising potential of MOHE in facilitating the healing of diabetic wounds, offering a topical approach to address this challenging healthcare issue."

Adequate breastfeeding is essential for stunting prevention, yet many mothers struggle with insufficient milk production. Moringa oleifera, known locally as moringa, has traditionally been used to increase breast milk production. Moringa plants have the potential to overcome various kinds of malnutrition or malnutrition problems in toddlers, pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers. This study aims is to examines the effect of consuming Moringa leaf-based vegetable soup on milk production in breastfeeding mothers with stunted toddlers at Leggung Health Centre. A quasi-experimental design was employed with 40 breastfeeding mothers of stunted toddlers (0-2 years) - 20 in the treatment group (given Moringa soup) and 20 in the control group (no treatment). Pretest results showed that only 57% of mother in the treatment group had adequate milk production, which increased to 76% after consuming Moringa leaf vegetable soup. The Mann-Witney U test revealed a significant difference (p = 0.000). These findings suggest that Moringa leaf soup can enhance breast milk production in breastfeeding mothers and may indirectly support stunting prevention efforts.",

Fish were fed four diets, including a CON-CON diet (with no supplementation) and CON-Ba (basal diet + 1 × 107 CFU/g B. amyloliquefaciens), MO-CON (basal diet + 10% Moringa oleifera) and MO-Ba (basal diet + 1 × 107 CFU/g B. amyloliquefaciens + 10% Moringa oleifera) until apparent satiation (2 meals/day). The results showed that the MO diet had a lower feed conversion ratio than the non-MO diets (P < 0.05). The weight gain in the Ba group was significantly higher than those in the groups without Ba treatment (P < 0.05). Both MO and Ba improved the morphological indices when applied individually (P < 0.05). Ba supplementation improved the activities of digestive enzymes (P < 0.05). MO significantly upregulated the gene expression of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and C3 in the spleen of Nile tilapia (P < 0.05), while Ba significantly upregulated the gene expression of IL-6 and C3 (P < 0.05). The microbiological analyses showed that the abundances of beneficial bacteria increased, and the relative abundances of pathogenic bacteria decreased in fish-fed MO. In conclusion, dietary MO and Ba can effectively improve the immunity of Nile tilapia, while Ba can enhance the activities of digestive enzymes. The synergistic effect of MO and Ba on the intestinal microbiota of Nile tilapia promotes growth, thus showing promising application prospects."

As plant-based medicines become increasingly popular, Moringa oleifera has been studied extensively for its plant-based components, and health benefits. The present review examined the anticancer effects of Moringa oleifera extracts on Oral squamous cell carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study complied with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses standards. A comprehensive search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar to find research papers published from January 2015 to August 2024 that assessed the effects of extracts of various parts of Moringa oleifera in Oral squamous cell carcinoma. Two independent reviewers separately assessed research study titles, abstracts, and the chosen full-text papers. The risk of bias in non-randomized exposure studies was classified as low, with some concerns high and extremely high. RESULTS: The final review yielded four in-vitro investigations, two molecular analyses, and five animal models. The study revealed that Moringa oleifera plant components have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and chemo-preventive properties. All the 11 studies showed a low risk of bias. CONCLUSION: The studies reviewed herein reveal that Moringa oleifera plant components have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and chemopreventive properties. Although more clinical trials are needed to fully establish its efficacy and safety as a complementary therapy, the growing body of evidence positions Moringa oleifera as a promising natural adjunct to cancer treatment strategies."

The leaves of these plants are reported to be rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and micronutrients and have been proven to have nootropic properties. Therefore, we investigated whether MO could provide protective effects on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells exposed to H2O2. In this study, we observed cotreating water-extracted MO leaves on the inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We found that this treatment enhanced the activities of glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. In addition, it suppressed the mRNA expression levels of apoptotic gene-related genes, specifically Bcl-2 associated protein X (BAX) and caspase 3. Furthermore, it promoted neuroplasticity by increasing the brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression in SH-SY5Y cells. The protein expression of phosphorylated-Akt and phosphorylated-CREB, essential genes in neuroplasticity, was also increased in cells treated with H2O2 and MO. Therefore, the neuroprotective effects of MO against oxidative stress are attributed to its antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties, as well as its ability to modify the neuronal signaling pathway.",

Water samples were analyzed with and without the addition of powder of MOS. The results showed that MOS addition reduced the total bacterial load from 1.73 × 1010 ± 3.21 × 109 to 6.67 × 106 ± 5.77 × 106 CFU/L, while fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli were removed with efficiencies of 99% and 57%, respectively. Furthermore, MOS treatment resulted in a reduction in fecal coliforms and E. coli resistant to ampicillin by about 100% and 96%, respectively. The results indicated that ciprofloxacin removal efficiencies at 29 °C were over 93% (fecal coliforms) and 68% (E. coli) with doxycycline. Adding MOS significantly reduced the copy number of the 16S rRNA gene and the genes conferring resistance to β-lactam (blaCTX-M, blaSHV, and blaTEM). However, MOS does not reveal real effectiveness on removal of pollutants (phosphorus and nitrates) contrary to what was expected. Additional studies are needed for confirmation from our observations. The findings of this study, whatever the functioning conditions (not optimal) of the prototype followed over 4 years, confirmed that MOS is potentially an effective natural and environmentally friendly coagulant that could be applied to wastewater treatment in low-income countries to remove or minimize multiple pollutants and control ARG spread. To promote sustainable development, this small-scale study provides guidance for designing infrastructure in resource-limited locations to take advantage of MOS effects in wastewater treatments.",

METHODS: Streptozotocin (145 mg/kg) was used to induce diabetes mice. In diabetes mellitus (DM) model mice were treated with MA formulation for 14 days at a D1 - 500 mg/kg (M) + 620 mg/kg BW (A), D2 - 1000 mg/kg (M) + 420 mg/kg (A), and D3 - 1500 mg/kg (M) + 200 mg/kg (A). On the 15th day, the mice were dissected for the isolation of their bone marrow by the flushing method. The analysis flow cytometry was performed to find out the TER-119, CD55, and CD59 expressions. The data were statistically analysed with one-way ANOVA (ρ≤ 0.05) and Tukey test using SPSS version 16 for Windows. RESULTS: The effect of MA administration in D3 group have a significant effect on increasing the profile of erythrocytes (TER-119), compared to DM (ρ≤0.05) group (STZ Injection-no treatment), as well as CD59 expressed by erythrocytes. MA administration in D1 group and D3 group significantly increased the profile of CD55 expressed by erythrocytes compared to DM (ρ≤0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MA formulation with D3 group (1500 mg/kg (M) + 200 mg/kg (A)) was able to maintain or control complement regulatory proteins (CD55 and CD59) on red blood cells (erythrocytes/TER-119) in DM."

This review focuses on M. oleifera's potential for neuroprotection, emphasizing its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neurotransmitter-modulating qualities. Different parts of M. oleifera include leaves, roots, bark, and gum. Flowers, seeds, and seed oil are used for many health purposes, most notably in the treatment of neurological diseases. Neurodegeneration, which is characterized by the progressive death of nerve cells, is a major concern with an aging population, leading to disorders such as dementia and movement disorders. M. oleifera bioactive compounds improve the antioxidant defense activities of the brain, reduce inflammation, and improve neurotransmitter levels, showing potential therapeutic applications for neurodegenerative disorders. This review emphasizes the importance of further research, especially clinical trials, to fully understand and utilize M. oleifera's neuroprotective capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Phyto-based treatments for anxiety and depression are gaining attention. The efficacy of the water-soluble Moringa oleifera seed lectin (WSMoL) in reducing acute anxiolytic and depressive-like behaviors in mice has been previously demonstrated. In the present study, it was evaluated the effects of WSMoL on reducing anxiety and depressive-like symptoms in a mouse model of unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). The animals were divided into groups and exposed to a four-week UCMS regimen. Following this, the mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of vehicle (non-stressed and UCMS control groups), WSMoL (2 or 4 mg/kg), or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) for 21 days. Neurobehavioral tests included the open field test and elevated plus maze test to assess anxiety-like behavior, and the tail suspension test and sucrose preference test to evaluate depression-like behavior. Biochemical analyses measured serum corticosterone and cytokines as well brain levels of cytokines and monoamines. All tests indicated that WSMoL significantly (p < 0.05) reversed the anxiety and depression-like behaviors induced by UCMS. The stress protocol increased serum corticosterone levels and WSMoL treatment was not able to normalize corticosterone secretion. WSMoL treatment reduced serum and brain levels of IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-α, indicating reduced neuroinflammation, and increased brain levels of dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline. In summary, WSMoL mitigated UCMS-induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors by reducing neuroinflammation and modulating brain monoamine levels.",

The present study evaluated the chemopreventive effect of the combined treatment of Lactobacillus acidophilus, calcium citrate, and Moringa oleifera leaves extract against DMH (1,1-dimethylhydrazine hydrochloride) induced colon cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats were grouped into 10 different groups and treated with DMH 30 mg/kg s.c. for 8 weeks, Successful induction of colon cancer was confirmed with the help of symptoms, Individual and combined treatments of Lactobacillus acidophilus (109 cfu p.o.), calcium citrate (2 mg/kg p.o.) and Moringa oleifera (100 & 200 mg/kg p.o.) leaves extracts were used for 4 weeks. RESULT: After 4 weeks of treatment, it was observed that a significant reduction in aberrant crypt foci (ACFs) count, whereas liver and kidney function, AST (aspartate transaminase), ALT (alanine transaminase), urea and creatinine biomarkers were retained in its normal range. Upon DMH treatment, liver tissue loses histoarchitecture with mononuclear cell infiltration, nuclear enlargement, and hyperchromasia, this reverts due to the combined treatment of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA), calcium citrate (CC) and hydroalcoholic extract of Moringa oleifera leaves (ME). From the results, it was revealed that individual and combined treatment of Lactobacillus acidophilus, calcium citrate, and hydroalcoholic extract of Moringa oleifera leaves shows beneficial effects against the carcinogen. CONCLUSION: Combined treatment of Lactobacillus acidophilus, calcium citrate, and hydroalcoholic extract of Moringa oleifera leaves showed positive effects against carcinogenesis and lowered aberrant crypt foci count and shows histoarchitectural improvements in liver histology with no nuclear enlargement and hyperchromasia in liver tissue.",

This study aimed to determine the anti-Toxoplasma effects of Cinnamon zeylanicum (CZ), Moringa oleifera (MO) oil encapsulated into solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). METHODS: Vero cells were cultured with serial concentrations (1 mg/mL to 100 µg/mL) of CZ-SLNs and MO-SLNs in DMEM culture medium. The morphological, physical, and chemical features of nanoparticles were calculated. The cell viability assays and anti-T. gondii effects of CZ-SLNs and MO-SLNs were evaluated. The CC50 and IC50 indices of SLNs-enveloped extracts were calculated. RESULTS: The particle sizes of MO-SLNs and CZ-SLNs were 411.5 and 365 nm, while PDI indices were 0.53 and 0.7, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that both MO-SLNs and CZ-SLNs were smoothed spherical nanoparticles with rounded edges. The cytotoxicity assay showed the CC50 value of MO-SLNs at concentrations of ˃10 mg/mL. In addition, 60% of T. gondii-infected Vero cells remained alive at the concentrations ≤ 1 mg/ml, while the MO-SLNs killed at least 90% of T. gondii tachyzoites with an IC50 > 1 µg/ml. The cytotoxicity of CZ-SLNs extract showed the CC50 at the concentration 0.1 mg/mL. More than 50% of Vero cells, infected with T. gondii tachyzoites, survived at a concentration less than 0.1 mg/mL (IC50 ˂ 0.1 mg/mL), while the CZ-SLNs killed at least 85% of T. gondii tachyzoites in all concentrations. CONCLUSION: The current results represented that the use of SLNs as a nano-carrier for M. oleifera and C. zeylanicum could kill T. gondii tachyzoites with low cytotoxicity, suggesting the effectiveness of these nano-emulsions along with the chemical agents in the treatment of Toxoplasma.",

      "abstract": "A study was conducted in Sylhet at Jaintiapur Upazila to determine the prospects of Moringa-based homestead concerning Sustainable Development Goals. A household survey was conducted following a simple random sampling of 135 farmers and following a semi-structured questionnaire and interview schedule with 100 farmers (40 identified Moringa-based adopters and 60 non-adopters). The final questionnaire was prepared after pilot testing, which contained data on common species diversity, and the perception of farmers regarding SDGs indicators of \"no poverty, zero hunger, good health, and well-being, gender equality, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth\". The extent of agreement was recorded following the points Likert scale high (3) to no change (0), and the SDG index (SDGI) value was calculated. The 10 key informant interviews were conducted with non-adopters to get insights into their perception regarding Moringa-based homesteads. The findings revealed that the status of plant species diversity such as betel nut (100 %), mango (100 %), bean (99 %), and arjun (90 %) was higher in comparison to non-adopters where the status of the respective species was 92 %, 99 %, 89 %, and 73 % respectively. The perception assessment revealed that 100 % of adopters and 90 % of non-adopters believed that Moringa-based homesteads had the potential to increase access to food, nutrition, and medicinal resources. While the majority of 70 % of adopters, and 90.5 % non-adopters disagreed that it had the potential to ensure government access and non-government credit resources. Among the Moringa-based homestead adopters, the gross income derived from Moringa sales was 2828.57 ± 1481.45, where 55 % of homesteads were identified to have Moringa plants between 3 and 5, and homesteads solely supplied fuel materials for 40 % of households. Gender participation was quite evident for homestead farming activities, where female participation was higher in planting, weeding, irrigation, and fencing. Homesteads provided both on-farming and off-farming income opportunities where major responses were found for poultry farming (96 %), vegetable farming (95 %), and day labor (97 %). Farmers were found to practice climate-smart practices of homestead agroforestry (100 %), rainwater harvesting (99 %), weeding (98 %), and management of debris (95 %) in their respective homesteads. The results disclosed that Moringa-based homestead in Sylhet can be a potential option for attaining SDGs indicators of escalation of household income (SDGI = 90), access to food, nutrition, and medicinal resources (SDGI = 103.6), facilitation of natural treatment of diseases (SDGI = 104.6), de-escalation of gender discrepancy in terms of production activities (SDGI = 103.64), own source of fuel (SDGI = 58.44), both off-farm and on-farm income opportunity (SDGI = 100.52), ecosystem health maintenance by resilient practices (SDGI = 104.6). Farmers ranked food security capacity as a major motivational factor, while the low economic return was a major demotivational factor. The escalation of Moringa-based homesteads needs to be prioritized while facilitating credit, and institutional support to extend encouragement to non-adopters for wider integration of Moringa-based homesteads, and appropriate utilization of the existing resources for greater profitability."

      "abstract": "Maternal endotoxemia disturbs the intrauterine environment, impairs nephrogenesis, and increases the risk of hypertension and kidney disease in adulthood. Here, it was investigated whether maternal treatment with the water extract of Moringa oleifera seeds (WEMoS) or the water-soluble M. oleifera seed lectin (WSMoL) prevents the oxidative stress induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in pregnant rats, and the renal injury and hypertension in the adult offspring. The administration of WEMoS or WSMoL prevented the stimulatory effects of LPS on lipid peroxidation in the maternal-placenta-fetuses environment. The impact of WEMoS was linked to decreased superoxide anions production in the placenta. The effects of WSMoL were parallel to the inhibition of superoxide anion production and NADPH oxidase activity. The WSMoL also prevented increased NADPH oxidase activity in the fetal kidney. The LPS offspring presented higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) and increased lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), NADPH oxidase activity, and nitrate/nitrite in the kidney; the maternal treatment with WEMoS and WSMoL prevented these changes. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that WEMoS and WSMoL have protective effects on maternal endotoxemia, which involve antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions that prevent the programming of hypertension.",

      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is a highly harmful pollutant that poses a serious threat to human health. The liver is the primary organ for Cd accumulation, and Cd-induced hepatotoxicity has been shown to be strongly correlated with an oxidative imbalance in hepatocytes. Our previous studies in the eukaryotic model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that not only co-treatment but also pretreatment with aqueous Moringa oleifera Lam. leaf extract (AMOLE) effectively mitigated Cd toxicity by reducing intracellular Cd accumulation and Cd-mediated oxidative stress. In this study, we therefore investigated the preventive effect of AMOLE against Cd toxicity in human HepG2 hepatocytes. The results showed that, similar to the case of the yeast model, pretreatment with AMOLE prior to Cd exposure also significantly inhibited Cd-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 cells. Untargeted LC-MS/MS-based metabolomic analysis of AMOLE revealed that its major phytochemical constituents were organic acids, particularly phenolic acids and carboxylic acids. Additionally, DPPH-HPTLC fingerprints suggested that quercetin and other flavonoids possibly contribute to the antioxidant activities of AMOLE. Based on our findings, it appears that pretreatment with AMOLE prevented Cd-induced hepatotoxicity via three possible mechanisms: i) direct elimination of free radicals by AMOLE antioxidant compounds; ii) upregulation of antioxidant defensive machinery (GPx1, and HO-1) via Nrf2 signaling cascade to improve cellular antioxidant capacity; and iii) reduction of intracellular Cd accumulation, probably by suppressing Cd uptake. These data strongly suggest the high potential of AMOLE for clinical utility in the prevention of Cd toxicity."

      "abstract": "Dysfunction of the extraorbital lacrimal gland (ELG) can lead to loss of vision due to damage to the epithelium of cornea. The broad-spectrum anti-epileptic drug sodium valproate (SV) has numerous side effects. Moringa oleifera (M.oleifera) is widely used as a food and in folk medicine. The effects of orally administered SV and M. oleifera hydroalcoholic leaf extract on rat ELG were investigated in this study by analysing both antioxidant and oxidant parameters. Additionally, boron level and tissue factor (TF) activity were determined. Protein changes were detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Significantly lower values of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and total antioxidant status (TAS) were observed in the SV group compared to the control group. Treatment with Moringa extract significantly increased SOD, CAT and TAS values in the Moringa given SV group (SVM). While no significant differences were observed between the sialic acid values of the groups, lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitric oxide (NO) and total oxidant status (TOS) values were significantly elevated in the SV group compared to the control group. Due to the effect of Moringa extract, LPO, NO and TOS levels were significantly decreased in the SVM group compared to the SV group. TF activity was not meaningfully altered between groups. Compared to control rats, oxidative stress index (OSI) level significantly increased, whereas the boron level decreased in the SV group. Moringa extract treatment noticeably reduced OSI in the SVM group. According to SDS-PAGE, decreases in the density of protein bands with molecular weights of 51, 83, and 90 kDa were observed in SV given rats compared to the other groups. These decreases were reversed by the administration of Moringa extract. Moringa extract has shown protective properties arising from antioxidant potential, especially with its very low OSI value. Individuals undergoing SV treatment and having ELG complications might consider using Moringa extract to mitigate valproate induced damage.",

This study investigates whether the hydro-alcoholic leaves of Moringa oleifera have any protective potential against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. The phytochemical analysis showed that the plant extracts contained bioactive compounds with antioxidant activities. The DOX-treated group confirmed a significant increment in cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, which indicates damage to the cardiomyocytes and also inflammation. However, treatment with the M. oleifera extracts significantly inhibited DOX-induced cardiomyocyte damage, as indicated by the significantly low cTnI release. Furthermore, treatment with M. oleifera extracts further increased antioxidant activities, thereby decreasing oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. Moreover, DOX was found to increase the IL-6 level, and treatment with M. oleifera extracts had a significant impact on the inhibition of IL-6 levels. These results indicate that the M. oleifera extracts have a cardioprotective effect and can play a role as an adjunct drug in mitigating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, thus providing new prospects for the improvement of safety and efficacy in the treatment of cancer."

This study aimed to explore the potential benefits of replacing alfalfa-based total mixed ration (TMR) with Moringa spp. On carcass characteristics and meat quality traits in lamb. The experiment involved 60 intact male lambs of the Harri breed, averaging 24 ± 1 kg in weight and approximately 5 months old. Lambs were randomly divided into five feeding groups: T1 (40 % alfalfa-based TMR), T2 (40 % M. oleifera), T3 (40 % M. peregrina), T4 (20 % alfalfa-based TMR + 20 % M. oleifera), and T5 (20 % alfalfa-based TMR + 20 % M. peregrina. The results confirmed that incorporating Moringa spp. Into lamb diets significantly reduced intramuscular fat content. Supplementation also improved tenderness, texture properties, and water-holding capacity. Additionally, the treatment groups exhibited a significant decrease in total non-carcass components compared to the control group. Overall, these findings suggest positive changes and enhancements in lamb carcass traits and meat quality attributes with Moringa spp. Supplementation, without observed adverse effects."

Due to the limited availability of anti-fibrotic drugs, the research on therapeutic agents continues. Here we have investigated Moringa oleifera Lam. (MO), known for its various bioactive properties, for anti-fibrotic effects. This study has focused on 1-phenyl-2-pentanol (1-PHE), a compound derived from MO leaves, and its effects on LX-2 human hepatic stellate cell activation. TGF-β1-stimulated LX-2 cells were treated with MO extract or 1-PHE, and the changes in liver fibrosis markers were assessed at both gene and protein levels. Proteomic analysis and molecular docking were employed to identify potential protein targets and signaling pathways affected by 1-PHE. Treatment with 1-PHE downregulated fibrosis markers, including collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1), collagen type IV alpha 1 chain (COL4A1), mothers against decapentaplegic homologs 2 and 3 (SMAD2/3), and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), and reduced the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Proteomic analysis data showed that 1-PHE modulates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, providing a possible mechanism for its effects. Our results suggest that 1-PHE inhibits the TGF-β1 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways and HSC activation, indicating its potential as an anti-liver-fibrosis agent.",

      "abstract": "A wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) prototype coupled with Moringa oleifera seeds (MOSs) was developed to evaluate its effectiveness to reduce metallic trace elements (MTEs) in domestic wastewater. The WWTP is composed of a septic tank (F0) where wastewater is treated by biological processes under anaerobic conditions, followed by a bacterial filter (F1) where wastewater is filtered under aerobic conditions, followed by an infiltration well (F2), which provides additional filtration of wastewater before discharge into the soil. MTEs present in waters can bind with humic substances contained in colloid particles and then be eliminated by coagulation-flocculation with a cationic polyelectrolyte. MOSs contain positively charged cationic polymers that can neutralize the colloids contained in waters, which are negatively charged. Based on this observation, 300 mg·L-1 of MOS was added into F0, 50 mg·L-1 into F1, and 50 mg·L-1 into F2 mg·L-1. MOS activation in samples was performed by stirring rapidly for 1.5 min, followed by 5 min of gentle stirring and 3 h of settling. The data analysis shows that wastewater samples had significant concentrations of MTEs, particularly for Cu, Ni, Sr, and Ti, and sediment samples had high amounts of Cr, Cu, Ni, Sr, Ti, and V. The addition of MOS to F0, F1, and F2 samples resulted in reductions in MTE concentration of up to 36%, 71%, 71%, 29%, 93%, 81%, 13%, 52%, and 67% for Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Se, Sr, Ti, and V, respectively. The quantified MTEs (As, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Se and V) in treated samples were reported to be lower than UN-EP standards for a safe reuse for irrigation and MOS proved to be as effective as chemical coagulants such as lime and ferric iron for the removal of MTEs contained in wastewater. These results highlight the potential of MOSs as natural coagulants for reducing MTE content in domestic wastewater. This study could be the first to evaluate the effectiveness of MOS in reducing 10 MTEs, including As, Co, Se, Sr, Ti, and V, which are currently understudied. It could also provide a better understanding of the origin of MTEs found in domestic wastewaters and how an effective treatment process can result in high-quality treated wastewaters that can be reused for irrigation without posing health or environmental risks. However, more research on MOSs is needed to determine the type and composition of the coagulant substance found in the seeds, as well as the many mechanisms involved in the decrease in MTEs by MOSs, which is currently understudied. A better understanding of MOS structure is required to determine the optimum alternative for ensuring the optimal effect of MOS paired with WWTP in removing MTEs from domestic wastewaters.",

      "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is among the main causes of mortality from cancer around the globe, affecting all genders. Current treatments mainly focus on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, resistance mechanisms, such as the emergence of T790M and C797S EGFR mutations and upregulation of VEGFR-2, often hinder the effectiveness of TKIs. Thereby, EGFR and VEGFR-2 present an intriguing opportunity for the treatment of NSCLC by developing dual-acting drugs. This research aims to evaluate prospective Moringa oleifera L. (MO)-originated compounds to efficiently block both of these receptors. In our research, we screened a library of 200 compounds sourced from MO, a plant known for its remarkable therapeutic potential. We identified five intriguing phytocompounds: hesperetin, gossypetin, quercetin, gallocatechin, and epigallocatechin, as potential anti-cancer agents. The compounds have demonstrated notable binding affinity in virtual screening and multi-stage molecular docking analysis, surpassing the controls, Erlotinib and Bevacizumab + Rituximab. In addition, these compounds demonstrate top-notch drug-likeness and ADMET properties. The five promising drug candidates also had a strong ability to bind to receptors and stayed stable with them during the 200 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and MM-GBSA calculation. Furthermore, DFT analysis indicates that hesperetin, gossypetin, and quercetagetin stand out as the most promising drug candidates among all others. The findings of our study suggest that these three therapeutic candidates can precisely target both EGFR and VEGFR-2 and can potentially act on both of these pathways as a single agent."

AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the toxicological profile of the oral use of an aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera leaves for 13 weeks in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Initially, a factorial design (23) was carried out to optimize aqueous extraction using as variables; the extraction method and proportion of drug. The 13-week repeated-dose toxicity trial used female and male mice, with oral administration of aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera leaves at doses of 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg. The animals were evaluated for body weight, water and feed intake, biochemical and hematological parameters, urinalysis, ophthalmology and histopathology of the liver, spleen and kidneys. RESULTS: The extraction efficiency was evidenced by the extraction by maceration at 5%, obtaining the optimized extract of Moringa oleifera (OEMo). The oral administration of OEMo did not promote significant difference (p > 0.05) in the weight gain, food and water consumption of the control animals and those treated with 250 and 500 mg/kg. However, treatment with 1000 mg/kg promoted a reduction (p < 0.05) in food intake and body weight from the 7th week onwards in male and female mice. No alterations were detected in the hematological and histological parameters in the concentrations tested for both sexes. The highest concentration treatment (1000 mg/kg) promoted an increase in transaminases in males and females. All concentrations promoted a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the serum lipid profile of mice. CONCLUSION: This study developed an optimized extract of Moringa oleifera leaves, which should be used with caution in preparations above 500 mg/kg for the long term because it leads to significant changes in liver enzymes. On the other hand, the extract proved to be a promising plant preparation for hyperlipidemia in mice.",

The objective of this study was to fill this gap in the littérature and provide a baseline evidence for further research or intervention by investigation the proportion and determinants of fresh Moringa stenopetala leaf intake among pregnant women in the Gamo zone, south Ethiopian region. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 623 randomly selected pregnant women using a pre-tested and structured questionnaire via a face-to-face interview. The consumption pattern was assessed based on a self-reported dietary history over the last 30 days before data collection. Multivariable logistic regression model was fitted using STATA version 14. An adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was reported to show an association between the dependent and independent variables with level of statistical significance at a p-value of <0.05. RESULTS: The proportion of fresh Moringa stenopetala leaves intake among pregnant women was 49.60% (95% CI: 45.67, 53.52%). The déterminants of fresh moringa leaf intake were being below 24 years old (AOR: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.51, 5.63), rural résidence (AOR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.10, 3.50), antenatal care attendance (AOR: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.03, 4.21), history of contraceptive use (AOR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.03, 3.55), and having a good knowledge about the importance of moringa Stenopetala (AOR: 9.76; 95% CI: 5.30, 17.95). CONCLUSION: The study showed that almost half of the pregnant women consumed fresh Moringa stenopetala leaves. Women's age, place of residence, prenatal care, history of contraceptive use, and knowledge of the benefits of Moringa Stenopetala were positively associated with the consumption of fresh Moringa Stenopetala leaves. Therefore, health authorities and stakeholders involved in maternal and child health need to target older women, and urban residents and promote the benefits of consumption by strengthening uptake of maternal health services and raising awareness about Moringa Stenopetela. Future studies involving large scale and longitudinal designs evidence are required to further validate the findings so that this nutritious diet can be promoted widely among pregnant women in the study area and Ethiopia at large."

      "abstract": "Edible films are thin films frequently manufactured using natural bioresources and are employed in food packaging to safeguard food quality. This research prepared edible films from renewable biomass consisting of Belitung taro tuber starch (Xanthosoma sagittifolium) and incorporated sorbitol as a plasticizer, carboxymethyl cellulose as a reinforcing agent, and moringa leaf extract (Moringa oleifera) as an antioxidant. The physicochemical characteristics of the resulting edible films were examined. The most favorable treatment was identified in an edible film containing 3% (v/v based on the total volume of 100 mL) of moringa leaf extract. This exhibited a tensile strength of 6.86 N/mm2, percent elongation of 73.71%, elasticity of 9.37×10-3 kgf/mm2, water absorption of 349.03%, solubility of 93.18%, and water vapor transmission speed of 3.18 g/h m2. Its shelf life was five days at ambient temperature. The edible film was found to have 135.074 ppm of half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) based on the antioxidant analysis of inhibition concentration (IC50) value measurements, and was classified as having moderate antioxidant activity. Additionally, the biodegradability assessment revealed that the edible films degraded within 14 days. Based on this data, it can be deduced that adding moringa leaf extract enhances the physicochemical and functional characteristics of the film. These edible films can be used as substitutes for nonrenewable and nonbiodegradable packaging materials."

      "abstract": "The wide biological activity of the Moringa oleifera represents a potential opportunity for developing selective cancer treatment drugs. The bioactive phytochemicals in Moringa seed extract (MSE) indicated large numbers of phytochemicals (21 compounds) with dominant abundance for cycloisolongifolene, 8,9-dehydro-9-vinyl, and chamazulene accounting for 12.7% and 12.19% of the total detected compounds. The MSE showed a potent anticancer effect toward Caco-2, MDA, and HepG-2 cells with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 9.15 ± 1.18, 4.85 ± 0.11, and 7.36 ± 0.22 µg/mL, respectively, with higher safety (≥31-folds) toward normal human cells (IC50 of 150.7 ± 11.11 µg/mL). It appears that MSE stimulates selective-dose-dependent cell shrinkage, and nuclear condensation in the tumor cells, which finally induces the apoptosis pathway to increase its anticancer action. Additionally, MSE showed a potent capability to stimulate cell cycle arrest in both main checkpoint phases (G0/G1 and G2/M) of cell population growth. The apoptotic death stimulation was confirmed through upregulation of tumor protein p53 (p53) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (p21) expression by more than three- to sixfold and downregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 expression (threefold) in MSE-treated cells compared to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-treated tumor cells. Furthermore, the MSE revealed strong anti-inflammatory activity with significant antioxidant activity by lowering nitric oxide levels and enhancing the superoxide dismutase activity. On the other hand, the MSE revealed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in a dose-dependent manner against Staphylococcus aureus minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC of 1.25 mg/mL), followed by Salmonella typhimurium (MIC of 1.23 mg/mL), whereas Escherichia coli was the least sensitive to MSE activity (MIC of 22.5 mg/mL) with significant antibiofilm activity against sensitive pathogens.",

This study tried to observe the research trend related to Moringa oleifera treatment to embryos of livestock in terms of frequently used words inside papers along with their citations. This study gathered 132 data samples from Scopus and 41 data from PubMed and processed them using the bibliometric method. The bibliometric software used was Vosviewer to produce the image of the author's keyword connection and trend and biblioshiny for depicting frequently words used as a title and inside content and mean of total citation/year. This study also used R Studio to complement Vosviewer in conducting the bibliometric method. The result showed that there was no author's keyword that depicted ruminant-type animals instead of cow, and no name of the animal as livestock that was being used as a title of the sample papers. There were also no papers that observed Moringa oleifera to treat sick embryos of livestock and the previous studies used as samples also had a low mean of total citation/year."

Constipation is probably one of the most prominent gastrointestinal symptoms (non-motor symptoms) of PD with devastating consequences. The aim of this research work is to formulate a functional food product, supplemented with inulin, cocoa, and Moringa, which can be an adjuvant in the treatment of constipation. The product was prepared according to a muffin or \"Chilean cake\" recipe; this basic muffin was prepared with additions of inulin (MI), inulin + cacao (MIC), and inulin + Moringa (MIM). A physical-chemical analysis of the macronutrients and an antioxidant capacity assessment of the samples were conducted, as well as a sensory evaluation performed by a group of people suffering from Parkinson's disease. A statistically significant difference was observed in the soluble (p = 0.0023) and insoluble (p = 0.0015) fiber values between the control samples and all samples. Furthermore, inulin + cacao improved the antioxidant capacity and folate intake compared to the control. Inulin alone has been shown to have antioxidant capacity according to ABTS (262.5728 ± 34.74 μmol TE/g) and DPPH (9.092518 ± 10.43 μmol TE/g) assays. A sensory evaluation showed a preference for the product with inulin and for the product with inulin + cacao, with a 78% purchase intention being reported by the subjects who evaluated the products. The incorporation of inulin and cacao improved the nutritional value of the muffins; the dietary fiber, antioxidant capacity and folate content are some of the features that stood out. A bakery product enriched with inulin, cocoa and Moringa could serve as a nutritional strategy to enhance nutritional value, thus helping in the treatment of constipation."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Doxorubicin (DOX) is one of the most potent anticancer drugs that has ubiquitous usage in oncology; however, its marked adverse effects, such as cardiotoxicity, are still a major clinical issue. Plant extracts have shown cardioprotective effects and reduced the risk of cardiovascular diseases. METHOD: The current study is intended to explore the cardioprotective effect of ethanolic Moringa Oleifera extracts (MOE) leaves loaded into niosomes (MOE-NIO) against DOXinduced cardiotoxicity in rats. MOE niosomes nanoparticles (NIO-NPs) were prepared and characterized by TEM. Seventy male Wistar rats were randomly divided into seven groups: control, NIO, DOX, DOX+MOE, DOX+MOE-NIO, MOE+DOX, and MOE-NIO+DOX. DOX (4 mg/kg, IP) was injected once per week for 4 weeks with daily administration of MOE or MOENIO (250 mg/kg, PO) for 4 weeks; in the sixth and seventh groups, MOE or MOE-NIO (250 mg/kg, PO) was administered one week before DOX injection. Various parameters were assessed in serum and cardiac tissue. Pre and co-treatment with MOE-NIO have mitigated the cardiotoxicity induced by DOX as indicated by serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase - MB(CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), cardiac Troponin 1(cTn1) and lipid profile. MOE-NIO also alleviated lipid peroxidation (MDA), nitrosative status (NO), and inflammatory markers levels; myeloperoxidase (MPO) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) obtained in DOX-treated animals. Additionally, ameliorated effects have been recorded in glutathione content and superoxide dismutase activity. MOE-NIO effectively neutralized the DOXupregulated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK), and DOX-downregulated nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expressions in the heart. RESULTS: It is concluded that pre and co-treatment with MOE-NIO could protect the heart against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by suppressing numerous pathways including oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis and by the elevation of tissue antioxidant status. CONCLUSION: Thus, it may be reasonable to suggest that pre and co-treatment with MOE-NIO can provide a potential cardioprotective effect when doxorubicin is used in the management of carcinoma.",

In the present study, 70% ethanol extract of moringa leaves was assessed for its in vivo biochemical and histological effects against valproate-induced kidney damage. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: Group I: control animals given physiological saline (n = 8); Group II: Moringa extract-administered group (0.3 g/kg b.w./day, n = 8); Group III: valproate-administered animals (0.5 g/kg b.w./day, n = 15); and Group IV: valproate + moringa extract (given similar doses of both valproate and moringa extract, n = 12) administered group. Treatments were administered orally for 15 days, the animals were fasted overnight, anesthetized, and then tissue samples harvested. In the valproate-administered experimental group, serum urea and uric acid were elevated. In the kidney tissue of the valproate rats, glutathione was depleted, antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, and glutathione peroxidase) disrupted, while oxidative stress biomarker, inflammatory proteins (Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6), histological damage scores, and the number of PCNA-positive cells were elevated. M. oleifera attenuated all these biochemical defects through its plethora of diverse antioxidant and therapeutic properties.",

Our study aims to investigate the potential molecular targets by which Moringa oleifera Lam leaf extract (Mor) and/or telmisartan (Telm) alleviate carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis in rats. Liver fibrosis was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by intraperitoneal injection of 50% CCl4 (1 ml/kg) every 72 hours, for 8 weeks. Intoxicated rats with CCl4 were simultaneously orally administrated Mor (400 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks) and/or Telm (10 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks). Treatment of CCl4-intoxicated rats with Mor/Telm significantly reduced serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities compared to CCl4 intoxicated group (P < 0.001). Additionally, Mor/Telm treatment significantly reduced the level of hepatic inflammatory, profibrotic, and apoptotic markers including; nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), transforming growth factor-βeta1 (TGF-β1), and caspase-3. Interestingly, co-treatment of CCl4-intoxicated rats with Mor/Telm downregulated m-RNA expression of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) (71.8%), and reduced protein expression of mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (p-SMAD3) (70.6%) compared to untreated animals. Mor/Telm regimen also elevated p-SMAD7 protein expression as well as m-RNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) (3.6 and 3.1 fold, respectively p < 0.05) compared to CCl4 intoxicated group. Histopathological picture of the liver tissue intoxicated with CCl4 revealed marked improvement by Mor/Telm co-treatment. Conclusively, this study substantiated the hepatoprotective effect of Mor/Telm regimen against CCl4-induced liver fibrosis through suppression of TGF-β1/SMAD3, and HDAC2/NF-κB signaling pathways and up-regulation of SMAD7 and PPARγ expression.",

      "abstract": "In this study, chemically activated fat-free powdered Moringa oleifera seed biomass (MOSB) was synthesized, characterized, and utilized as a cost-effective biosorbent for the abstraction of progesterone (PGT) hormone from synthetic wastewater. Natural PGT is a human steroid hormone from the progestogen family. Synthetic PGT is approved for the regulation of the menstrual cycle, aiding contraception, and is administered as a hormone replacement therapy in menopausal and post-menopausal women. PGT is an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) with negative health impacts on biota. The X-ray diffractogram (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy-Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) analyses displayed a porous, amorphous biosorbent with an elemental composition of 72.5% carbon and 22.5% oxygen and a specific surface area of 210.0 m2 g-1. The process variables including temperature (298-338 K), pH (2-10), contact time (10-180 min), adsorbate concentration (20-500 μg L-1), and adsorbent dosage (0.1-2.0 g) were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM) to obtain the greatest efficacy of MOSB during biosorption of PGT. The optimum parameters for PGT biosorption onto MOSB were: 86.8 min, 500 μg L-1 adsorbate concentration, 298 K, and 0.1 g adsorbent dosage. PGT removal from aqueous solutions was pH-independent. The Langmuir isotherm best fitted the equilibrium data with maximal monolayer biosorption capacity of 135.8 μg g-1. The biosorption rate followed the pseudo-first-order (PFO) kinetic law. The thermodynamic functions (ΔG < 0, ΔH = -9.258 kJ mol-1 and ΔS = +44.16 J mol-1) confirmed that the biosorption of PGT onto MOSB is a spontaneous and exothermic process with increased randomness at the adsorbent surface. The biosorption mechanism was physisorption and was devoid of electrostatic interactions. The findings from this study indicate that MOSB is an inexpensive, low-carbon, and environmentally friendly biosorbent that can effectively scavenge PGT from aqueous solutions.",

Analyses performed included the comet assay, micronucleus test (MN) in bone marrow cells and sperm head abnormality assay (SHA). M. oleifera and T. cordifolia extracts induced no significant genotoxic effects on somatic and germ cells. In contrast, for all cells examined M. oleifera and T. cordifolia extracts inhibited DNA damage initiated by CP. Taken together data demonstrated that both plant extracts did not exhibit marked genotoxic effects but displayed potential chemoprotective properties against CP-induced genotoxicity in Swiss mice.",

      "abstract": "In Indonesia, malaria remains a problem, with 94,610 active cases in 2021 and its current therapy includes chloroquine and artemisinin; however, resistance has been commonly reported. To overcome this problem, studies about potential medicinal plants that can be used as antimalaria, such as moringa (Moringa oleifera) started to receive more attention. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of moringa in parasitemia, monocyte activation, and organomegaly on animal model malaria. This experimental study used male Mus musculus, infected by Plasmodium berghei ANKA, as an animal malaria model. The extract was made by maceration of dry moringa leaves, which were then divided into three concentrations: 25%, 50%, and 75%. Dihydroartemisinin-piperazine was used as a positive control treatment, and distilled water as a negative control treatment. The animals were observed for six days to assess the parasitemia count and the number of monocyte activation. On day 7, the animals were terminated, and the liver, spleen, and kidney were weighed. The results showed that the effective concentrations in reducing parasitemia and inducing monocyte activation were 50% and 25% of moringa leaf extract, respectively. The smallest liver and spleen enlargement was observed among animals within the group treated with a 50% concentration of M. oleifera extract. In contrast, the smallest kidney enlargement was observed in the group treated with 25% of M. oleifera extract. Further analysis is recommended to isolate compounds with antimalarial properties in moringa leaves.",

      "abstract": "The effect of heat treatment on the abundant bioactive compounds in moringa seed kernels (MSKs) during different degrees of roasting remains sparingly explored despite the flour of roasted MSKs has been incorporated into the human diet (e.g., cakes, cookies, and burgers) as a substitute to enrich the nutritional content. Therefore, we investigated the impacts of different roasting conditions (e.g., temperature and duration) on bioactive compounds (e.g., glucosinolates (GSLs), phenolic acids and alkaloids) and antioxidant capacity of MSKs. Our results showed that light and medium roasting increased the glucomoringin (GMG, the main GSL in MSKs) content from 43.7 (unroasted MSKs) to 69.7-127.3 μmol/g MSKs (dry weight), while excessive/dark roasting caused thermally-induced degradation of GMG (trace/undetectable level) in MSKs, resulting in the formation of various breakdown products (e.g., thiourea, nitrile, and amide). In addition, although roasting caused a significant reduction of some phenolic compounds (e.g., gallic, chlorogenic, p-coumaric acids, and trigonelline), other phenolic acids (e.g., caffeic and ferulic acids) and alkaloids (e.g., caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline) remarkably increased after roasting, which may contribute to the enhanced total phenolic content (up to 2.9-fold) and antioxidant capacity (up to 5.8-fold) of the roasted MSKs.",

The investigation of the potential applications of polymers as natural and non-hazardous materials has placed significant emphasis on their physicochemical properties. Thus, this study was designed to investigate the potential of gelatin-chitosan-moringa leaf extract (G-CH-M) as a novel biomaterial for biomedical applications. The wound-dressing G-CH-M biopolymer was synthesized and characterized. The blood haemolysis, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities of the biopolymer were investigated against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacterial isolates. Our results showed that S. aureus swarming motility was drastically affected. However, the biopolymer had no significant effect on the swarming motility of E. coli. In addition, the biopolymer showed high antibacterial capacities, especially against S. aureus. Plasmid DNA was observed to be effectively protected from oxidative stresses by the biopolymer. Furthermore, the biopolymer exhibited greatly suppressed haemolysis (lower than 2%), notwithstanding the elevated concentration of 50 mg/mL. These results indicated that this novel biopolymer formulation could be further developed for wound care and contamination prevention."

METHODS: In this study, 24 titanium implants were inserted in the femurs of six rabbits. One implant was placed without treatment, and another one was coated with a mixture of whey protein and M. oleifera gel for each side. The animals were divided into two groups of 2- and 6-week intervals and evaluated using histopathological and immunohistochemical techniques. RESULTS: Histological evaluation revealed a significant difference between the experimental and the control groups after two weeks in osteoblast and osteocyte counts. The experimental group had mature bone development after six weeks of implantation, while the control group had a woven bone. Immunohistochemical results showed that the experimental group, compared to the control group, exhibited early positive expression of osteoblast cells at two weeks after the experiment. Based on histopathological observations, the experimental group showed a tiny area of collagenous fiber in 6th week after the implantation. CONCLUSION: A mixture of whey protein and M. oleifera could accelerate osseointegration and healing processes.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effect of MOL polysaccharide (MOLP) on intestinal flora in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) mice. DSS-induced colitis was deemed to be a well-characterized experimental colitis model for investigating the protective effect of drugs on UC. In this study, we stimulated the experimental mice with DSS 4% for 7 days and prepared the high dose of MOLP (MOLP-H) in order to evaluate its effect on intestinal flora in DSS-induced UC mice, comparing three experimental groups, including the control, DSS model, and DSS + MOLP-H (100 mg/kg/day). At the end of the experiment, feces were collected, and the changes in intestinal flora in DSS-induced mice were analyzed based on 16S rDNA high throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that the Shannon, Simpson, and observed species indices of abundance decreased in the DSS group compared with the control group. However, the indices mentioned above were increased in the MOLP-H group. According to beta diversity analysis, the DSS group showed low bacterial diversity and the distance between the control and MOLP-H groups, respectively. In addition, compared with the control group, the relative abundance of Firmicutes in the DSS group decreased and the abundance of Helicobacter increased, while MOLP-H treatment improves intestinal health by enhancing the number of beneficial organisms, including Firmicutes, while reducing the number of pathogenic organisms, such as Helicobacter. In conclusion, these findings suggest that MOLP-H may be a viable prebiotic with health-promoting properties."

However, combining plant gum with synthetic degradable polymer and some additives can improve these properties. Keeping in view, the present study aimed to synthesize a series of bioplastic films using Moringa oleifera gum, polyvinyl alcohol, glycerol, and citric acid via thermal treatment followed by a solution casting method. The films were characterized using analytical techniques such as FTIR, XRD, SEM, AFM, TGA, and DSC. The study examined properties such as water sensitivity, gas barrier attributes, tensile strength, the shelf life of food, and biodegradability. The films containing higher citric acid amounts showed appreciable %elongation without compromising tensile strength, good oxygen barrier properties, and biodegradation rates (>95%). Varying the amounts of glycerol and citric acid in the films broadened their physicochemical properties ranging from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity and rigidity to flexibility. As all the films were synthesized using economical and environmentally safe materials, and showed better physicochemical and barrier properties, this study suggests that these bioplastic films can prove to be a potential alternative for various packaging applications.",

The general behavior, body weight, food intake, blood indexes, serum biochemical indexes, and histopathology of rats were used to determine the safety threshold and to provide a reference for the further development and use of Moringa as animal feed. 40 Sprague Dawley rats were selected and given transoral gavage for 28 consecutive days. The T1, T2 and T3 groups were observed for general behavior, body weight, and food intake. Blood and serum biochemical indices were quantified, and histopathology was performed to evaluate the effect and safety of Moringa. The results of the toxicological test showed that (1) Only T1 groups experienced diarrhea. (2) The body weight and food intake of rats in each group were normal compared with the control group. (3) The hematological and serum biochemical indices of rats in the T1 group were significantly different from those of CK but were in the normal range; (4) The results of microscopic examination of the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney of rats in each group were normal, but inflammation occurred in stomach and jejunum of rats in the T1 group, but not in the ileum. The gastrointestinal tract of rats in the T2 and T3 groups were normal. (5) No abnormal death occurred in any of the treatment groups.The results of this study revealed that gavage of Moringa homogenate at a dose of 6 g/kg BW can cause diarrhea in rats. Although there is no pathological effect on weight, food intake, blood and serum biochemical indicators in rats, there are pathological textures in the gastrointestinal tissue caused by diarrhea. Therefore, the safety threshold of Moringa homogenate should be ≤ 3 g/kg BW.",

      "abstract": "An investigation of the impact of adding plant-based organic compost to clay soil from a Moringa oleifera farm focusing on the metal content, bioavailability, and accumulation of nutrients in M. oleifera leaves was conducted. Clay soil was mixed with 15%, 30%, 45% and 60% plant-based organic compost (by volume) in 20 cm wide, 2 L pots. Moringa oleifera plants were planted in four replicates of each treatment and control group. Results revealed that the addition of compost significantly (P < 0.05) altered the concentration of metals in the soil. Correspondingly, accumulation of nutrients in M. oleifera leaves increased with the addition of compost to the soil, except for cobalt and chromium. Trace elements had minimal bioavailability in the amended soils, and their presence in the leaves was lower than the permissible trace metal levels in food. The 30% combination had the highest concentration of calcium (45 042.5 mg/kg), magnesium (17430.0 mg/kg) and phosphorous (8802. 5 mg/kg) in M. oleifera leaves. The study concluded the addition of compost improved bioavailability of nutrients in the soil and their concentration in M. oleifera leaves. The target hazard quotients for heavy metals was less than one, indicating that M. oleifera leaf biomass harvested from soil amended with plant-based compost is safe for human consumption. These results serve as guidelines for recommended organic certification requiremets where plant-based compost is often used in the fast-growing herbal industry.",

Its wide use has led to higher morbidity and mortality, especially in developing countries. Moringa seed extracts (MSE) have shown neuroprotective activity, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial features. The literature lacks data investigating the role of MSE against CPF-induced cerebral and ocular toxicity in mice. Therefore, we aim to investigate this concern. A total of 40 mature male Wistar Albino mice were randomly distributed to five groups. Initially, they underwent a one-week adaptation period, followed by a one-week treatment regimen. The groups included a control group that received saline, MSE 100 mg/kg, CPF 12 mg/kg, CPF-MSE 50 mg/kg, and CPF-MSE 100 mg/kg. After the treatment phase, analyses were conducted on serum, ocular, and cerebral tissues. MSE100 and CPF-MSE100 normalized the pro-inflammatory markers (interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)) and AChE serum levels. CPF-MSE50 significantly enhanced these serum levels compared to CPF; however, it showed higher levels compared to the control. Moreover, the tissue analysis showed a significant decrease in oxidative stress (malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO)) and an increase in antioxidant markers (glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX)), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) in the treated groups compared to CPF. Importantly, the significance of these effects was found to be dose-dependent, particularly evident in the CPF-MSE100 group. We conclude that MSE has a promising therapeutic effect in the cerebral and ocular tissues of CPF-intoxicated mice, providing a potential solution for OP public health issues."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate effective treatment strategies for laboratory waste with an initial pH of 1.0, containing Cr6+, Mn2+, Co2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Sr2+, Hg2+, and Pb2+ ions, focusing on flocculation, precipitation, and adsorption techniques. The study utilized microparticles derived from Moringa oleifera seed husks (MS), cryogels of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and hybrid cryogels combining CMC and MS (CMC-MS25 and CMC-MS50) as adsorbents. The optimal strategy involved raising the pH to 7 using NH4OH, leading to the partial precipitation of metal ions. The remaining supernatant was then passed through columns packed with the aforementioned adsorbents. Utilizing CMC-MS25 and CMC-MS50 adsorbents resulted in the simultaneous removal of over 90% of the targeted metal ions. The adsorption of Cu2+ ions onto the adsorbents was facilitated by electrostatic interactions between Cu2+ ions and carboxylate groups, as well as Cu-OH chelation, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Under optimized conditions, the fixed-bed column adsorption capacity was determined as 88.2 mg g-1. The CMC-MS25 adsorbents proved reusable at least 5 times, with the recovered Cu2+ ions potentially suitable for other processes. The scalability and feasibility of producing these novel adsorbents suggest a promising, cost-effective solution for treating complex matrices and recovering high-value metals, as copper.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) are well defined as food poisoning pathogens that are highly resistant and need continuous studies. AIM: The purpose of the work was to examine phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, and treatment trials with medicinal plants. METHODS: Samples were examined for isolation of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus on selective media followed by biochemical confirmation, biofilm formation, genes detection, and expression of P. aeruginosa pslA biofilm gene was performed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction after treatment with 0.312 mg/ml Moringa oleifera aqueous extract as a minimum inhibitory concentration. RESULTS: The highest isolation rate of P. aeruginosa was 20% from both raw milk and Kariesh cheese, followed by 16% and 12% from ice cream and processed cheese, respectively, while the highest isolation rate of S. aureus was 36% from raw milk followed by 28% in ice cream and 16% in both Kariesh cheese and processed cheese. 30% of P. aeruginosa isolates were biofilm producers, while only 21% of S. aureus isolates were able to produce biofilm. The P. aeruginosa isolates harbor virulence-associated genes nan1, exoS, toxA, and pslA at 100%, 80%, 40%, and 40%, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus SEs genes were examined in S. aureus strains, where SEA and SEB genes were detected with 60%, but no isolate harbored SEC, SED, or SEE. The significant fold change of P. aeruginosa pslA expression was 0.40332 after treatment with M. oleifera aqueous extract. CONCLUSION: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus harbor dangerous virulence genes that cause food poisoning, but M. oleifera extract could minimize their action.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Initiation of ART among people living with HIV (PLWH) having a CD4 count ≤ 350cells/µl, produces poor immunological recovery, putting them at a high risk of opportunistic infections. To mitigate this, PLWH on ART in Uganda frequently use herbal remedies like Artemisia annua and Moringa oleifera, but their clinical benefits and potential antiretroviral (ARV) interactions remain unknown. This study examined the impact of A. annua and M. oleifera on CD4 count, viral load, and potential ARV interactions among PLWH on ART at an HIV clinic in Uganda. METHODS: 282 HIV-positive participants on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with a CD4 count ≤ 350cells/µl were randomized in a double-blind clinical trial to receive daily, in addition to their routine standard of care either; 1) A. annua leaf powder, 2) A. annua plus M. oleifera, and 3) routine standard of care only. Change in the CD4 count at 12 months was our primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included changes in viral load, complete blood count, and ARV plasma levels. Participants were followed up for a year and outcomes were measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: At 12 months of patient follow-up, in addition to standard of care, administration of A. annua + M. oleifera resulted in an absolute mean CD4 increment of 105.06 cells/µl, (p < 0.001), while administration of A. annua plus routine standard of care registered an absolute mean CD4 increment of 60.84 cells/µl, (p = 0.001) compared to the control group. The A. annua plus M. oleifera treatment significantly reduced viral load (p = 0.022) and increased platelet count (p = 0.025) and white blood cell counts (p = 0.003) compared to standard care alone, with no significant difference in ARV plasma levels across the groups. CONCLUSION: A combination of A. annua and M. oleifera leaf powders taken once a day together with the routine standard of care produced a significant increase in CD4 count, WBCs, platelets, and viral load suppression among individuals on ART. A. annua and M. oleifera have potential to offer an affordable alternative remedy for managing HIV infection, particularly in low-resource communities lacking ART access.

      "abstract": "Global warming is a key challenge subjecting animals to heat stress conditions resulting in multiple physiological alterations in tropical climate. Dietary approach seems to be the more friendly approach to curb the adverse effects of heat stress in rabbits. Some herbs have been categorized to have high potential for promotion of immune responses for amelioration of heat stress. Thus, this research aims to evaluate the potential of Mistletoe (Viscum album), Moringa (Moringa oleifera) and Phyllanthus (Phyllanthus amarus) leaf meal as herbal supplements for the alleviation of heat stress in female rabbits by measuring improvement in sex and stress hormonal responses in serum biochemistry. 80 Rabbit does were exposed to 4 dietary groups supplemented with each of Mistletoe, Moringa, Phyllanthus and a control in an 84-day trial at the summit of thermal stress in South west Nigeria. Growth indices were monitored throughout the study, blood samples were compiled at the end of the trial to assess serum biochemistry, stress and sex hormonal responses of the Does using standard protocols. The results revealed that final weight and weight gain of Does fed on Phyllanthus were significantly (p < 0.05) higher (11.46% and 14.25%, respectively) than Does on control. The herbal supplements enhance glucose, protein, albumin and globulin, reduced cholesterol, and creatinine of Does under heat stress conditions. Among the herbal treatment groups, mistletoe, moringa and phyllanthus had 12.42%, 18.39% and 16.90%, respectively, lower corticosterone than control groups which had 39.76ng/ml. Triiodothyronine of Does fed control were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than Does on Moringa oleifera and Phyllanthus amarus supplements. Estradiol and Follicle stimulating hormone of rabbit Does fed on moringa supplement were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than other treatments. In conclusion, the herbal supplements tend to mitigate the detrimental outcome of thermal stress on Does by suppressing stress hormones. Moringa oleifera and Phyllanthus amarus enhanced sex hormones while Phyllanthus amarus confered growth promoting effects on the Does."
