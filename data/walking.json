      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are common among older adults, with the highest prevalence observed in Japan. These fractures cause pain, reduce quality of life, and increase the need for physical therapy. This study identified key factors at admission that predict walking ability at discharge in patients with VCFs. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 143 patients aged ≥65 years with VCFs. VCFs are fractures in which only the anterior column of the vertebral body collapses. The primary variables assessed upon admission included the revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS-R) score, grip strength, skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), and phase angle (PhA). Propensity score matching was applied to adjust for background factors, after which a logistic regression analysis using a generalized linear model was conducted to determine whether these variables influenced walking ability at discharge. RESULTS: Significant associations were observed between walking ability at discharge and HDS-R score at admission (p < 0.001, effect size [ES] = 0.42), grip strength (p = 0.027, ES = 0.23), SMI (p = 0.025, ES = 0.23), and PhA (p < 0.001, ES = 0.40). Logistic regression analysis indicated that HDS-R score (odds ratio [OR] = 1.19, p = 0.005) and PhA (OR = 3.21, p = 0.015) during admission significantly predicted walking ability at discharge. CONCLUSION: Walking ability at discharge in patients with VCFs can be predicted based on early assessments. In particular, HDS-R score and PhA at admission may serve as key indicators for prognosis in patients with VCFs."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To examine the effects of a 12-week rehabilitation program of exercise combined with diet education on the quality of life (QOL) and symptoms (anxiety, depression, rest/activity circadian rhythm (RACR), and sleep) of patients with esophageal cancer. METHODS: We used a two-parallel-arms randomized controlled trial. The experimental group (EG) participated in a 12-week program involving walking exercise and diet education. The control group (CG) received standard care. The primary outcome was QOL, measured using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL core questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and esophageal module 18 (EORTC QLQ-OES18). Secondary outcomes were anxiety, depression, RACR, and sleep characteristics. Measurement time points were baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after recruitment. RESULTS: Of 85 enrolled patients with esophageal cancer (EG = 43, CG = 42), the majority were male, 59 years old on average, and had received surgery. The EG recorded significantly better 24-h autocorrelation coefficient (0.06 to 0.24, p = 0.002; Cohen's d = 0.98) of rest/activity rhythms parameters at 6 months. In the EG, total sleep time significantly increased at 3 months (16.36 to 86.07, p = 0.004; Cohen's d = 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: The intervention improved the RACR and sleep of patients with esophageal cancer. Healthcare professionals may consider incorporating this rehabilitation program into routine care alongside cancer treatment for patients with esophageal cancer.  TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov (registration number: NCT03161535).

DESIGN: Single-arm, pre-post feasibility study. SETTING: University research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Adult walking aid users (N=13). INTERVENTION: Participants used the novel application's fitting and gait training modules pertaining to their walking aid on two occasions (baseline, 2 weeks). OUTCOME MEASURES: Trial feasibility indicators were collected for process (recruitment rate, consent rate, and retention rate), resources (duration of each data collection session), management (participant processing time), and safety. At baseline and at 2 weeks, participants completed the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale, the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG), and the 2-minute Walk Test (2MWT). RESULTS: Thirteen walking aid users (7 males; mean±SD age 55±15 years; mean±SD duration of walking aid use: 2.7±4.0 years) participated. Feasibility was attained on 3 out of the 6 trial feasibility indicators. Participants achieved statistically significant improvements in balance confidence (ABC; small to medium effect; p<0.001) and balance (BBS; small effect; p<0.001). Participants did not experience significant changes in mobility (TUG; no effect) or endurance (2MWT; small effect; p=0.25). CONCLUSION: Based on our criteria, a trial with the novel application may be feasible, with some modifications. Preliminary improvements in clinically relevant outcomes including balance confidence and balance were found. These findings will help inform a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of the application on clinical outcomes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: After spinal cord injury (SCI), poor dorsiflexor control and involuntary plantar-flexor contraction impair walking. As whole-body vibration (WBV) improves voluntary muscle activation and modulates reflex excitability, it may improve ankle control. In this study, the dosage effects of WBV on walking speed, dorsiflexion, and spinal reflex excitability were examined. METHODS: Sixteen people with chronic motor-incomplete SCI participated in this randomized sham-control wash-in study. Two weeks of sham stimulation (wash-in phase) were followed by either 2 weeks of eight repetitions (short bout) or sixteen repetitions of WBV (long bout; intervention phase) per session. Walking speed, ankle angle at mid-swing, and low-frequency depression of the soleus H-reflex were measured before and after the wash-in phase and before and after the intervention phase. RESULTS: A significant dosage effect of WBV was not observed on any of the measures of interest. There were no between-phase or within-phase differences in ankle angle during the swing phase or in low-frequency depression. When dosage groups were pooled together, there was a significant change in walking speed during the intervention phase (mean = 0.04 m/s, standard deviation = 0.06, p = 0.02). There was not a significant correlation between overall change in walking speed and dorsiflexion angle or low-frequency depression during the study. CONCLUSIONS: Whole-body vibration did not have a dosage-dependent effect on dorsiflexion during the swing phase or on spinal reflex excitability. Future studies assessing the role of corticospinal tract (CST) descending drive on increased dorsiflexor ability and walking speed are warranted."

Nordic walking could improve gait, balance, strength, endurance and respiratory function while enjoying nature. METHOD: Thirty-four adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities were assessed for physical performance and emotional status before and after participating in a six-month intervention comprised of weekly Nordic walking sessions. Five staff members were also interviewed about the programme. RESULTS: Nordic walking was found to be feasible, with an average monthly attendance of 60.75%. Following the intervention, significant improvements were seen in lower-extremity strength, flexibility and waist-to-hip ratios. CONCLUSIONS: Nordic walking motivates participants to engage in physical activity, strengthens muscles, and increases flexibility. Thus, people who work with adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities may consider including Nordic walking in their health enhancement and maintenance programmes.",

      "abstract": "Assessing movement biomechanics is important for understanding healthy locomotion, injury or disease progression, and recovery. However, laboratory- or clinic-based studies fail to capture the ecological factors of real-world activity. Advancements in wearable sensors provide an opportunity to capture movement biomechanics in these settings. This study demonstrates the capacity of a wearable system to measure patellar and Achilles tendon kinetics via tensiometry as well as knee and ankle kinematics via inertial measurement units while walking across varied terrains, including level ground, sloped pavement, and stairs. The wearable system successfully captured time-varying tendon loading over the walking gait cycle. Both patellar and Achilles tendon loading showed distinct sensitivities to changes in slope and stairs. Importantly, these tendon loading patterns correspond well with prior measurements of knee extension and ankle plantarflexion moment profiles obtained via traditional motion analysis. This represents a significant advancement over studies that relied on traditional complex, immobile equipment to obtain comparable results. The portability of the wearable system may allow for objective assessments of human performance, injury risk, functional adaptation due to injury, and treatment response in real-world environments."

However, the lack of sustainable gait interventions that collectively promote sufficient intensity, daily amount, and quality of walking marks a critical gap in PD rehabilitation. In this randomized controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov#: NCT05421624, registered on June 6, 2022), we demonstrate the effectiveness of a real-world walking intervention delivered using an autonomous music-based digital rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) system. In comparison to an active-control arm (N = 20) of moderately intense brisk walking, the autonomous RAS system used in the experimental arm (N = 21) amplified moderate-to-vigorous walking intensities, increased daily steps, and improved (reduced) gait variability. While regular engagement in real-world walking with or without RAS each cultivated habits for walking, only the RAS intervention yielded a combination of strengthened habits and improved gait outcomes. Findings from this study supported the use of a personalized, autonomous RAS gait intervention that is effective, habit-forming and translatable to real-world walking in individuals with PD."

      "abstract": "Background: Multiple sclerosis can cause walking and balance disorders. These complications cause extensive disturbances in the quality of life, independence, and self-care and affect many aspects of their lives. The guided imagery method is a simple, easy, and safe intervention. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted to determine the effect of guided imagery on walking and balance dysfunction in patients with multiple sclerosis in 2023. Sixty-six patients were randomly divided into two intervention and control groups (n = 33). The intervention group listened to the audio file of nature-based guided imagery, and the control group did not receive any intervention. Data were collected by 6-min walk test, 25-ft walk test, and Berg balance scale before and after the intervention. Analysis of the average results of movement disorder and balance intra- and intergroup, before and after the study, was done with a paired t-test, independent t-test, and analysis of covariance. The significance level in all tests is 0.05, with a confidence level of 95%. Results: After performing guided imagery, in the intervention group, walking dysfunction significantly improved, with changes from 429.55 ± 42.78 to 459.24 ± 41.48 in the 6-min walk test, 7.12 ± 0.37 to 6.74 ± 0.44 in the 25-ft walk test, and the improvement of balance level with changes of 26.60 ± 3.13 to 31.72 ± 3.64 in the Berg balance test. Conclusion: Using guided imagery can improve walking dysfunction and balance in patients with multiple sclerosis. Trial Registration: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials: IRCT20220614055170N1.",

Dynamic assessment offers an alternative to conventional static measurements, potentially improving the evaluation of sagittal balance. Ten patients aged 56-73 years completed a six-minute walking assessment while being monitored by the optoelectric Qualisys Motion Capture System. Forty-nine reflective markers were placed to measure the spino-pelvic and sagittal balance parameters across five gait phases: pre-walk, initial-walk, mid-walk, end-walk, and post-walk. Test-retest reliability was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The results showed excellent reliability for thoracic kyphosis angle (ICC = 0.97), C7-L5 sagittal trunk shift (ICC = 0.91), and global tilt angle (ICC = 0.99); good reliability for auditory meatus-hip axis sagittal trunk shift (ICC = 0.85); and moderate reliability for pelvic angle (ICC = 0.57), lumbar lordosis angle (ICC = 0.72), and sagittal trunk angle (ICC = 0.73). Despite minor marker placement inconsistencies and variations in body movement across trials, the findings support the use of this dynamic assessment method in research settings. Its clinical application could also enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning for patients with sagittal balance disorders, allowing for better-tailored therapeutic interventions.",

Twenty participants underwent forward, backward, and sideways walking trials with and without the CEX. Results indicated a significant (more than 70 %) reduction in anterior and posterior walking speed on CEX, while lateral walking speed remained unaffected (less than 25 %). Despite the diminished pace in forward and backward walking, CEX demonstrated potential as a dynamic assistive device in occupations involving frequent squatting. More importantly, lateral walking with CEX did not exhibit a significant decrease in speed compared to walking without the device, positioning it as a pragmatic solution for individuals operating in lowered workplaces without compromising overall productivity. These findings highlight the potential of the CEX as an effective intervention to enhance mobility while squatting in confined areas, such as during tile installation. The study provides recommendations for safe and effective utilization of CEX in the workplace."

      "abstract": "Postmenopausal women often experience fatigue and mood disturbance both of which interfere with quality-of-life. Since greater physical function aids psychosocial well-being, we hypothesized the acute cardiopulmonary responses during walking may reveal important factors linked to fatigue and mood disturbance. In this cross-sectional study, women of similar body mass index (BMI) aged 55-75 y were dichotomized to mid-life (55-65 y; 83.4 ± 8.4 kg/m2; n = 14) or older (≥65 y; 81.8 ± 10.4 kg/m2; n = 11) groups. A 6-minute walk test was used to estimate peak aerobic capacity (V̇O2peak). A treadmill task coupled with indirect calorimetry measured mean response time (MRT) - representing the duration to reach 63 % of steady-state net oxygen uptake (V̇O2). Average daily fatigue and fatigue interference were measured with the Fatigue Symptom Inventory. General mood disturbance was measured with the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire. Age-group differences were not detected in fatigue ratings, MRT, or walking net V̇O2. However, older women had lower aerobic capacity (p = 0.002, ES = 1.39) and greater disturbance in the POMS Depression-Dejection subscale (p = 0.042, ES = 0.41). Among all participants, and independent of V̇O2peak, MRT correlated with average daily fatigue (r = 0.500, p = 0.015), fatigue interference (r = 0.421, p = 0.046), and POMS total mood disturbance (rs = 0.437, p = 0.037). Regression modeling revealed MRT and walking net V̇O2 jointly explained 55 % (R = 0.744, p < 0.001) of the variance in average daily fatigue. In conclusion, MRT and walking net V̇O2 may serve as important points of intervention to alleviate fatigue and mood disturbance in postmenopausal women."

In addition, it may be a symptom associated with other conditions such as anemia, physical deconditioning, or anxiety. Methods: A prospective study was conducted, between 1 January 2021 and 30 June 2022, at the Medical Recovery Section from \"Dr. Pop Mircea Municipal Hospital Pop Mircea\" in Marghita. A total of 163 consecutive patients with chronic dyspnea of various etiologies were evaluated for inclusion in the study. Patients who met the inclusion criteria followed a personalized physical training program of variable duration (between 20 and 40 min) up to the limit of exercise tolerance (grade 3-4 modified Borg scale or up to 70% of maximum heart rate, calculated with the formula 220 age in years); the first 10 days, the training was supervised by a physiotherapist, then patients followed a program of 30 min of exercise 5 days/week at home for 3 months. Assessments, performed at inclusion and after 3 months of training, consisted of the 6 min walk test (6MWT) and the London Chest Activity of Daily Living (LCADL) scale. Results: Pulmonary etiology is the most common cause of dyspnea in the cohort (61.65%). The number of patients without ventilatory defects is 56, or 38.35%. The mean value of initial functional limitation (LCADL1) improved significantly after 3 months (LACDL2) of rehabilitation treatment (38% versus 26.5%); at the same time, the mean walking distance (6MWT) increased by 76 m. Conclusions: An adequate rehabilitation program and sedentary lifestyle change significantly reduce the functional limitation of the patient with chronic dyspnea and increase walking distance. Predictors for 6MWT gait test are age, LCADL score, dyspnea level, and cardiac etiology of chronic dyspnea.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Regular walking has been reported to improve metabolically-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) by altering the metabolic environment. However, no studies to date have focused on older individuals in both conditions. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of a 12-week walking intervention on metabolic syndrome risk factors, liver function indicators, and liver ultrasound findings in older adults with both metabolic syndrome and MASLD. METHODS: A total of 66 participants aged 65-85 years had average ages, heights, and weights of 75.3 ± 5.8 years, 159.3 ± 9.3 cm, and 68.6 ± 6.8 kg, respectively. The participants resided in four senior living communities, and their diets were uniform. The participants from two facilities were assigned to the control group (CON, n = 33), whereas those from the other two facilities were allocated to the treadmill walking program group (WPG, n = 33). Each group comprised 13 males and 20 females. The intervention consisted of a low- to moderate-intensity walking program, conducted for 30 min per day, 6 days per week, totaling 180 min per week. The total daily calorie expenditure was recorded based on the values calculated from the treadmill. The walking intensity was adjusted by modifying the treadmill incline according to each participant's heart rate corresponding to their maximal oxygen consumption (VO₂max). The exercise intensity was set at 50% on Mondays and Fridays, 60% on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and 70% on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Sundays were designated as rest days. RESULTS: Although there were no significant differences in caloric intake between the groups, the WPG exhibited a 52.5% increase in physical activity levels (p < 0.001), resulting in significant reductions in body weight (-10.2%), fat mass (-17.2%), and abdominal fat (-4.8%). The WPG showed a 16.1% increase in VO₂max, along with significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (-9.6%) and blood glucose (-16.9%), as well as notable improvements in lipid profiles (p < 0.001). The WPG also demonstrated significant reductions in aspartate aminotransferase (-40%), alanine aminotransferase (-23.5%), total protein (-14.4%), albumin (-8.1%), bilirubin (-17.6%), and liver ultrasound scores (-31.8%), with all changes showing significant intergroup differences (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Along with a consistent diet, a 12-week walk has been shown to induce significant changes in the body composition and cardiometabolic factors of older adults, as well as notable improvements in liver function markers and imaging findings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered with the Clinical Research Information Service of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under Clinical Trials KCT0010079 on 26/12/2024."

This scoping review aims to synthesize evidence on the characteristics, effectiveness, feasibility, and neurological mechanism of virtual walking interventions on health-related outcomes. Articles in English were retrieved from twelve databases (January 2014-October 2024). Thirteen interventional studies were included, focusing on three types of virtual walking: passive observing moving (71.4%), arm swing locomotion (21.5%), and foot tracking locomotion (7.1%). Most studies (84.6%) involved individuals with spinal cord injuries, while the remaining studies focused on lower back pain (7.7%) and lower limb pain (7.7%). Over 70% of studies lasted 11-20 min, 1-5 weekly sessions for 10-14 days. Statistically significant findings included pain reduction (84.6%), improved physical function (mobility and muscle strength), and reduced depression. Mild adverse effects (fatigue and dizziness) were transient. Neurological evidence indicates somatosensory cortex activation during virtual walking, possibly linked to neuropathic pain."

The six-minute walking test can be done to assess a person's functional ability, response to therapy, and prognosis of chronic heart-lung conditions. The study aims to determine the safety of the six-minute walking test in inpatients after percutaneous coronary intervention by assessing the response of vital signs, Borg scale, and angina scale. METHODS: This study was a one-group pre-and post-test design study with subjects of inpatients after percutaneous coronary intervention at the Integrated Cardiac Service in Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital Jakarta. Research subjects conducted a six-minute walking test twice with a five-minute break in between. Examination of vital signs, Borg scale, and angina scale before and after walking test. The number of subjects was 30 (27 male and 3 female) with the majority classified as a low-risk stratification. RESULTS: The six-minute walking test was performed over two days or more in 56.7% of the subjects. The mean covered distance was 294.68 ± 57.02 meters. Vital signs of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale increased during the test. They decreased to baseline after resting for five minutes with p-value <0.05 in the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Changes in saturation, dyspnea, and leg fatigue of the Borg scale, and angina scale were not statistically significant. All study subjects did not have major adverse events. CONCLUSION: The six-minute walking test is safe to do in inpatients after percutaneous coronary intervention with vital signs, Borg scale, and angina scale change accordingly to physiological response.",

      "abstract": "A higher risk of knee osteoarthritis (OA) has been identified in patients with slower walking speeds following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Given that altered loading of the surgical knee has been the most proposed mechanism for early knee OA post-ACLR, understanding how modulating walking speed may modify knee joint loading is essential for developing strategies to reduce the risk of knee OA in ACLR patients. The purpose of this study was to determine how modulation of walking speed affects knee joint loading during overground walking post-ACLR. Lower extremity kinematics and kinetics were recorded during overground walking at a self-selected, slower, and faster speed from 16 patients with unilateral ACLR. The results showed that ACLR patients demonstrated lesser peak knee flexion and adduction moments of the surgical knees when walking at slower speeds. However, modulating walking speed did not alter between-limb knee loading asymmetry. The ACLR limbs had lower peak knee flexion moments than the uninjured limbs across all 3 walking speeds. Although interventions that increase walking speed may deter the onset of knee OA by elevating the mechanical stimulation at the surgical knee, additional gait training strategies may be needed to restore the between-limb loading symmetry in ACLR patients."

While traditional exercise can help, limitations and injury risks persist. This study explores low-frequency vibration training as a potential alternative to improve walking ability and body composition in older adults. METHODS: A lottery was used to randomly assign 50 participants (mean age 80.08 years) to either a vibration group (n = 25, 10 males, 15 females) or a control group (n = 25, 11 males, 14 females). While the control group continued their regular daily schedule, the vibration group completed 8 weeks of low-frequency vibration training (frequency: 4-13 Hz; amplitude: two mm), three sessions per week, with each session lasting 20-30 minutes. The walk ability was assessed using the 30-second Chair Stand Test (30-s CST), Timed Up and Go (TUG), and six-meter (six m) walk speed, while body composition was measured via body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, and waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). RESULTS: Low-frequency vibration training significantly increased walking speed in the six m walk speed (F (1,36) = 4.50, p = 0.04, η p 2 = 0.11) and TUG (z =  - 2.72, p = 0.007), compared with the control group. Observed improvements on the 30-s CST were not statistically significant (F (1,36) = 0.05, p = 0.81, η p 2 = 0.002). In the WC, the effect of time (F (1,36) = 7.19, p = 0.01, η p 2 = 0.16) was significant. The main effect of the group for HC (F (1,36) = 0.06, p = 0.80, η p 2 = 0.002) and WHR (F (1,36) = 2.00, p = 0.16, η p 2 = 0.05) were not significant, but the interaction effects for HC (F (1,36) = 6.37, p = 0.01, η p 2 = 0.15) and WHR (F (1,36) = 9.08, p = 0.005, η p 2 = 0.20) were significant. However, the intervention showed no statistically significant effects on BMI and body fat percentage. CONCLUSION: Low-frequency vibration training significantly enhanced walking speed and WHR in older adults. This low-intensity intervention is especially beneficial for those with exercise limitations or a high risk of injury. Although its effects on BMI and body fat percentage were limited, the study offers valuable insights for developing personalized vibration training programs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common intervention for treating end-stage knee osteoarthritis (OA). Postoperatively, altered biomechanics may increase the risk of OA progression in the contralateral knee. Knee adduction moment (KAM) is a key indicator of medial knee joint loading and is associated with OA progression. Walking aids are often prescribed to reduce joint stress during walking; however, their comparative effects on KAM in patients undergoing TKA remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different walking aids (double canes [D-canes], rollators without forearm support [rollators], and rollators with forearm support [F-rollators]) on KAM peak and impulse in both the operated and contralateral knees of patients after TKA using gait analysis. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was conducted on eight women who underwent unilateral TKA. Participants walked under four conditions: no aid, D-canes, rollators, and F-rollators. A three-dimensional motion capture system measured the lower limb kinematics and kinetics. The primary outcomes were KAM peak and impulse for both knees. Secondary outcomes included ground reaction force in the vertical direction (GRF Z), forward trunk tilt angle, and lower limb joint angles. A two-way repeated-measures measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for statistical comparisons. RESULTS: Walking aids significantly reduced the KAM peak and impulse in both the operated and contralateral knees compared with unaided walking (P < 0.001). In the operated knee, the KAM peak decreased by approximately 20% with all aids, whereas in the contralateral knee, reductions were 6% for D-canes, 16% for rollators, and 24% for F-rollators. Rollators and F-rollators more effectively reduced contralateral knee loading than D-canes (P < 0.001). A significant negative correlation was found between trunk forward tilt angle and GRF Z (ρ= -0.74, P < 0.001), suggesting that increased forward lean with rollators and F-rollators enhanced lower limb offloading. No significant changes were observed in knee varus angle or walking speed across conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Walking aids, particularly F-rollators, effectively reduce KAM and offload the contralateral knee in patients after TKA. These findings suggest potential benefits for patients at risk of OA progression in non-operated knees."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a 7-week group-based outdoor walking exercise therapy intervention on walking capacity and mental well-being as well as additional outcomes in pwMS. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, n = 62 ambulatory pwMS (49/62, 79% females; 51 years [range, 27-68 years]), patient-determined disease steps 1.7 (range, 0-4) were assigned to either a WALK group (a 'personalized' program suited to the starting level of each participant, including one continuous and one intermittent supervised walking session per week at moderate-to-high intensity) or a CONTROL group (continuation of habitual lifestyle). Tests were carried out at baseline (Pre) and after the intervention (Post). Walking capacity included 6-minute walk test (6MWT; primary outcome), timed 25-foot walk test (T25FWT), and six spot step test (SSST). Walking fatigability indexes were calculated from 6MWT data. Patient-reported outcomes included 12-item MS Walking Scale (MSWS), modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS), 7-item falls efficacy scale-international (FES-I), World Health Organization five well-being index (WHO5; main secondary outcome), and 0-100 visual analogue scale health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). RESULTS: Across the 7-week intervention period, n = 17 (5/17, 27%) pwMS dropped out. No adverse events were reported. Across all WALK sessions, 78% of the time was spent on forest/gravel trails. Substantial between-group changes were observed (beneficial changes in WALK vs no changes in CONTROL) in 6MWT (mean change [95% CI]; +41 m [22;60]; deemed clinically relevant), T25FWT (+0.27 [0.15;0.39] m/s), SSST (-0.80 [-1.33;-0.27] s), WHO5 (+7.3 [0.1;14.5] points), MSWS (-5.1 [-9.2;-1.0] points), MFIS (-6.7 [-11.7;-1.7] points), FES-I (trend; -0.8 [-1.7;0.1] points), and HR-QoL (trend; +5.3 [-2.3;12.9] points). In contrast, walking fatigability indexes remained unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Outdoor walking exercise therapy elicited multiple beneficial effects in pwMS, especially evidenced by improvements in walking capacity and mental well-being.

METHODS: A total of 52 patients who underwent lumbar fusion surgery were randomly assigned to either the early functional training group (n = 26) or the routine rehabilitation group (n = 26). The early functional training group (FT group) began a progressive functional training program within the first 12 weeks post-surgery, while the routine rehabilitation group (RH group) started the same training program 12 weeks after surgery. The primary outcome was the walking distance, measured as the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) at the 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the multifidus muscles, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score, the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) subscales, including the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS), and the incidence of adverse events. The primary aim was evaluated using a 2-way mixed-model analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with treatment group as the between-subjects factor and time as the within-subjects factor, after adjusting for baseline measures. RESULTS: Among the total patients, 38 (73.1%) left with at least one follow-up result, and 29 (55.8%) completed all treatment sessions and obtained an MRI assessment. The mixed-model ANCOVA revealed a significant group-by-time interaction for the 6MWD (F = 6.214, p = 0.003). Patients in the FT group demonstrated superior 6MWD compared to the GH group at 3 months (95% CI: 32.51 to 101.88, p < 0.001). No significant differences were found between the two groups at the 6-month follow-up (95% CI: -15.34 to 54.03, p = 0.271). Regarding secondary outcomes, no significant group-by-time effects were found for ODI (F = 1.221, p = 0.299), PCS (F = 0.166, p = 0.847), or MCS (F = 0.282, p = 0.755). No significant differences were found in the CSA of multifidus muscles between the groups. Nine patients (17.3%) experienced adverse events. CONCLUSION: Early functional training after lumbar fusion was not superior to routine rehabilitation in improving walking distance, multifidus atrophy, pain, physical function, and quality of life during the 6-month follow-up.

METHODS: The study included 120 college students (60 males and 60 females). HIR was measured using a smartphone inclinometer app in the prone position and a compass app in the supine position. Plantar pressure was assessed using the Gaitview® AFA-50 system during standing and walking. Correlation analysis was performed using SPSS 27.0. RESULTS: Among all subjects, HIR activity in the prone position was significantly negatively correlated with standing second through fourth metatarsophalangeal joints (MTPJ2-4), fifth metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ5), and midfoot (FM) pressures and significantly positively correlated with standing first toe (T1) pressure. During walking, there is a significant negative correlation between HIR in the prone position and MTPJ2-4, MTPJ5, FM, and lateral heel (LH). Similarly, in the supine position, HIR is significantly negatively correlated with MTPJ2-4, MTPJ5, FM, medial heel (MH), and LH. CONCLUSION: There is a significant negative correlation between HIR and lateral plantar pressure, indicating that reduced HIR is associated with increased lateral plantar pressure. Improving HIR through targeted rehabilitation may reduce lateral plantar pressure, offering new approaches for non-surgical treatment of little toe capsulitis and reducing the risk of fifth metatarsal stress fractures."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Individuals after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) participate in less physical activity compared to uninjured peers. Physical activity in this population is important for both short and long-term health, particularly to reduce the risk of chronic conditions (eg, obesity, osteoarthritis). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a walking program early after ACLR. DESIGN: Explanatory Mixed Methods Study. SETTING: Telehealth. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Ten individuals (60% female, mean age 20.2 ± 3.9 years old, mean BMI 22.6 ± 2.9 kg/m2 ) within 8 weeks of a unilateral ACLR. INTERVENTION: A 12-week personalized progressive walking program to increase daily steps utilizing weekly virtual visits with a physical therapist. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quantitative data included rates of appointment attendance, activity monitor wear compliance, adverse events, and achievement of daily step goals. Qualitative analysis of field notebooks collected throughout the intervention and semi-structured post intervention interviews were performed to explain the quantitative feasibility metrics using a case study approach. RESULTS: Participants wore their activity monitor 92.3% of days, attended 94.2% of appointments, met their recommended physical activity goal 54.8% of days, and 50% of individuals reached their physical activity target at least 50% of weeks. No adverse events related to the walking program were reported. Program-level and participant-level themes that promoted successful physical activity goal achievement were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated mixed feasibility and acceptability of a progressive walking program early after ACLR. Participants demonstrated high adherence to wearing an activity monitor and completing weekly virtual physical activity program sessions. However, daily physical activity goals were only met approximately half of the time. Clinicians and researchers can use the themes identified from the qualitative analysis in future program designs to promote physical activity after ACLR."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: We report the effectiveness of task-specific walking training for a child with hereditary spastic paraplegia using various orthoses, assistive mobility aids, and tasks. SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS: A 4-year-8-month-old boy, classified as Gross Motor Function Classification System level IV, had selective dorsal rhizotomy and single-event multilevel surgery. The child began walking training using knee-ankle-foot orthoses and a posterior walker, setting the tasks to be \"just right\" for improving the child's abilities. CONCLUSION: At 6 years and 11 months of age, the child walked using bilateral ankle-foot orthoses and crutches at school, and scores improved on the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, Gross Motor Function Measure-66, and Functional Mobility Scale.Recommendations for Clinical Practice: Physical therapists need to carefully select the factors involved in walking training based on an assessment and the difficulty level of each child in order to optimize improvements."

      "abstract": "The global ageing population necessitates public health strategies to address age-related health decline. While physical activity is widely recognised as beneficial, exercise referral schemes often struggle to sustain participation. Walking football, an adapted version of traditional football designed for middle-aged and older adults, offers a unique alternative by harnessing intrinsic motivators such as enjoyment and social interaction to encourage long-term engagement. This narrative review examines walking football's potential as a public health intervention, focusing on its safety and physical and mental health effects. The results reveal that walking football's slower pace and reduced physical contact make it accessible and safe for individuals with various chronic conditions. However, limited evidence on injury rates and the lack of standardised injury surveillance highlight the need for consistent data collection to evaluate long-term safety. Emerging research indicates modest improvements in cardiovascular health and body composition, though findings are constrained by small, predominantly male samples, limiting generalisability. Qualitative studies highlight positive mental health impacts for individuals with mental health conditions, including enhanced social connections, self-confidence and purpose in life. Nonetheless, quantitative evidence on mental health outcomes remains sparse, emphasising the need for robust studies with validated pre-post intervention measures. Overall, walking football shows promise as a safe strategy to promote physical and mental health among diverse populations. Further research is crucial to better understand its benefits, limitations and safety profile, enabling its effective integration into exercise referral schemes and social prescribing initiatives aimed at increasing physical activity and well-being in middle-aged and older adults."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Mechanical loading is an important, modifiable risk factor for knee osteoarthritis. Identifying walking loads associated with disease worsening presents intervention opportunities. Our purpose was to evaluate the longitudinal relation of the baseline vertical ground reaction force (GRF) during walking to worsening bone marrow lesions (BMLs) and cartilage damage using cohort data from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST). METHODS: MOST participants with GRF data at baseline and magnetic resonance imaging examinations at baseline and 2-year follow-up were included. Peak impact force (PIF) and average loading rate (ALR) from the vertical GRF were analyzed with respect to four joint regions (i.e., the medial and lateral portions of the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints). Analyses used logistic regression with generalized estimating equations and adjusted for relevant covariates. RESULTS: Higher PIF was associated with increased odds of worsening BMLs in the lateral patellofemoral joint (odds ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]): 1.33 (1.11, 1.60)) and worsening cartilage damage in the lateral patellofemoral joint (1.48 (1.24, 1.77)), lateral tibiofemoral joint (1.24 (1.03, 1.50)), and medial tibiofemoral joint (1.25 (1.06, 1.48)). Higher ALR was associated with reduced odds of BML worsening in the lateral tibiofemoral joint (0.60 (0.41,0.87)). CONCLUSIONS: Higher peak forces when walking were associated with worsening BMLs in the lateral patellofemoral joint and with worsening cartilage damage in regions of the knee associated with higher contact forces during walking. Higher ALRs were not associated with increased odds of structural worsening (BMLs or cartilage)."

METHODS: A Phase II pilot randomised trial with concealed allocation, blinded measurement, and intention-to-treat analyses. Twenty-four individuals who were physically inactive, had a stroke within the past six months, and had mild walking disability were recruited. The experimental group received six 60-minute sessions of home-based self-management and usual care over 3 months. The control group received one 60-minute educational session on stroke and usual care. Primary outcome was physical activity (steps/day) at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular risk, walking ability, depression, exercise self-efficacy, participation, and quality of life. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference between-group was found at 3 and 6 months. At 3 months, clinically meaningful between-group differences were found for physical activity (MD 1380 steps/day), self-efficacy (MD 2 points), and participation (MD 13%). At 6 months, clinically meaningful between-group differences were found in self-efficacy (MD 3 points) and participation (MD 11%). CONCLUSION: The lack of sustained improvement in physical activity suggests further studies should focus on enhancing self-efficacy and maintaining engagement in self-monitoring.

Angiography revealed a completely obstructed abdominal aorta, with no circulation to the femoral arteries and perfusion only through collateral vessels. This severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD) was diagnosed during her hospitalization, raising the question of why it had remained undiagnosed for years and whether earlier detection could have improved her outcome. Women with PAD often present with atypical or absent symptoms, leading to underdiagnosis. Early screening with the Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) is crucial for accurate diagnosis. Moreover, gaps in PAD recognition led to inadequate treatment of comorbidities, less aggressive pharmacologic therapies, and fewer revascularization strategies, resulting in poorer outcomes. This case highlights the unique risk factors and diagnostic challenges in women with PAD, which contribute to healthcare disparities."

RESEARCH QUESTION: Is a 24-week dual-task protocol training, beginning with alternating cognitive demands and progressing to simultaneous dual-tasking, more effective than a control group training only with alternating dual tasks in improving the physiological complexity of postural control in older adults during upright standing posture under interoceptive and exteroceptive demands and gait under dual tasks? METHODS: This randomized controlled trial enrolled 60 community-dwelling older adults of both sexes, aged between 60 and 80. The experimental group (EG; n = 30) underwent training with progression from alternating dual-task (ADT) to simultaneous dual task (SDT) during activities such as gait, and static and dynamic functional balance. The control group (CG; n = 30) only underwent the ADT protocol throughout the six months of training. The primary outcome of this study was the physiological complexity of gait under dual task calculated by the refined composite multiscale fuzzy entropy method for the anteroposterior (AP), mediolateral (ML), and vertical (V) directions. The outcomes were acquired at baseline (T1) and after 24 weeks of intervention (T2). The analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle, using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with a significance level of 5 %. RESULTS: No interaction or group effects were observed. However, both groups significantly improved body sway physiological complexity in the AP direction during gait under ST, ADT, and SDT and in the V direction under ADT and SDT. No change in complexity during upright standing posture under interoceptive and exteroceptive demand was significantly observed, regardless of the group. SIGNIFICANCE: Regardless of the training protocol, both groups significantly improved the physiological complexity of gait under dual task."

This study tests the feasibility and initial impact of a digitally delivered mindful-walking (MW) intervention for improving the physical and psychosocial wellbeing of COVID-19 long haulers. We recruited 23 participants via Facebook groups, between March and November 2021, for a 4-week online MW intervention (i.e., 2 mindfulness practice sessions per week), that was delivered entirely through the study Facebook group. The intervention was assessed using mixed methods. Quantitative data were collected through brief daily evening surveys (i.e., 28 days) over the 4-week intervention period, and measured affect, cognition, mindfulness, physical activity, and MW engagement. Qualitative data were extracted from the Facebook group's Paradata (i.e., participant feedback, engagement metrics, and all social media interactions). Multilevel modeling was employed for the statistical analysis and a pragmatic approach was used for the qualitative analysis. The participants reported a high feasibility score (mean=4.93/7, SD=1.88), which was comprised of perceived usefulness, satisfaction, and ease of use. Those who engaged in MW, on any given day, frequently reported better psychosocial moods with more positive affect (β=0.89, p<0.01), less negative affect (β=-0.83, p<0.01), higher perceived cognitive ability (β=0.52, p<0.05), and more physical activity (β=0.41, p<0.05). Additionally, participants who practiced MW more consistently during the study reported higher levels of momentary mindfulness (β=0.3 p<0.01). Participants expressed satisfaction with the intervention, reporting benefits such as better symptom management and an overall improvement in wellbeing. Despite the small sample size, the digital delivery of our MW intervention via Facebook showed high acceptability. Preliminary efficacy findings indicate improved mental wellbeing and physical activity among long haulers. Larger-scale RCTs are needed in the future to improve the robustness and applicability of findings."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Adults with spina bifida have impaired mobility and often rely on assistive devices like crutches for walking, which exert high torque demands on the upper extremities. Blood flow restriction training (BFRT) may improve strength and gait measures by increasing intensity of training when applied during walking for individuals with limited walking tolerance. However, no studies have investigated the application of BFRT to the upper extremities for individuals who rely on crutches for walking. CASE DESCRIPTION: This case describes a 29-year-old female with diastematomyelia, a rare form of spina bifida, who had lower extremity weakness and reduced gait capacity requiring crutches. The patient underwent 8 weeks of bilateral upper extremity BFRT during walking. The BFRT program consisted of 4 bouts of walking per session, each lasting 3 minutes with 35-50% limb occlusion pressure. Outcomes measured at baseline and 8 weeks included the 10 Meter Walk Test (10MWT), Timed Up and Go (TUG), 5 Times Sit-Stand Test (5×STS), hand-held dynamometry of 8 upper extremity muscles, and a BFRT satisfaction questionnaire. OUTCOMES: After 8 weeks, she demonstrated improvements on the 10MWT (0.15 m/s, 23%), TUG (-3.4s, 20%), 5×STS (-3.4 s, -22%), and upper extremity strength improvements ranged from 8-79% (2.8-6.7 kg). There were no adverse events related to the intervention and satisfaction was high. DISCUSSION: Bilateral upper extremity BFRT was safely applied during walking in an adult with spina bifida. The improvements in strength and functional mobility warrant future study among individuals who rely on upper extremity strength for ambulation."

      "abstract": "Although eccentric contraction protocols are widely used to study the pathophysiology and potential treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), they do not reflect the stresses, strains, strain rates, and excitation profiles that DMD muscles experience during human daily functional tasks, like walking. This limitation of eccentric contractions may impede our understanding of disease progression in DMD and proper assessment of treatment efficacy. The goals of this study were to examine the extent of force loss induced by a gait cycling protocol we developed, and compare to that from a typical eccentric contraction protocol in soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of mdx mice. To achieve this goal, mdx soleus and EDL muscles were subjected to eccentric contractions at three levels of strain (10%, 20% and 30% optimal length Lo) and up to 200 cycles of our gait cycling protocol that mimicked the length changes and excitation patterns of the corresponding muscles during human walking gait. Our results showed that EDL but not soleus muscles had significant losses in isometric tetanic forces after the cycling protocols. Compared to the eccentric contraction protocol, the decrements in contractile performance from the cycling protocol were similar to those from the eccentric contractions at 10% in soleus and 20% Lo in EDL. Together, these results indicated the gait cycling protocol is a valuable experimental approach to better understand disease progression and to screen and evaluate efficacy of novel therapeutics for DMD.",

We aimed to investigate the effects of once a week comprehensive physiotherapy and home exercise on musculoskeletal system of PwHA. METHODS: In this study 19 young PwHA with knee and/or ankle were non-randomly divided into two groups: The Home Exercise Group (HEG) and the Comprehensive Physiotherapy Group (CPG). Joint health was evaluated with the Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS), muscle strength (MS) with manual muscle tester, range of motion (ROM) with universal goniometer, pain with Numerical Pain Scale (NPS). The following functional tests were used: 6 min Walking Test (6MWT) for walking capacity, Functional Reach Test (FRT) for dynamic balance and Fitlight® system for visuomotor reaction time (VMRT). The frequency of hemarthrosis (FoH) in the last 6 weeks was obtained from the self-recorded data. The CPG received comprehensive physiotherapy once a week, including manual therapy, neuromuscular electrical stimulation and supervised exercises, and they performed home exercises for the other two days of the week. The HEG only performed home exercises 3 days a week. All the treatments lasted 6 weeks and evaluations were repeated. RESULTS: Compared with the HEG, the CPG significantly ameliorated for NPS, FoH, HJHS, VMRT (time and mean), 6MWT, all MS and several ROMs. CPG significantly improved in all outcomes except for 1 ROM. The HEG significantly improved in FoH, HJHS, VMRT (time), 6MWT and MS, but not in the ROMs. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive physiotherapy once a week and continuing home exercise significantly improve joint health, functionality and balance, and reduce pain and hemarthrosis in PwHA.

DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Veterans Affairs Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-two (N=92) United States military Veterans. INTERVENTIONS: Standardized rehabilitation for 12 weeks following TKA plus random assignment to either a PABC or attention-control intervention (CTL). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sitting, standing, and stepping patterns (daily total time and bouts) and free-living walking cadence patterns were measured using thigh-mounted triaxial accelerometry (activPAL3) for 10 consecutive days. Outcomes were analyzed with a linear mixed model that estimated mean between-group differences within 2-4 weeks pre-TKA and post-TKA at 8, 14, and 38 weeks. RESULTS: No between-group differences were observed at any time point for sitting, standing, or stepping total times or average bout durations. The PABC group spent significantly more time walking at a brisk cadence compared to CTL (P<.001), with the largest group difference noted at 38 weeks, which was 24 weeks after intervention end (∆=8.36 min; 95% confidence interval, 4.83-11.88). CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that PABC helped Veterans after TKA increase and sustain the duration of daily brisk cadence walking. Future investigations should incorporate the PABC to explore potential interventions to reduce sedentary behavior and assess how improvements in the duration of daily brisk cadence post-TKA affect long-term mobility, functional, and pain outcomes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traditional foot reflexology impacts autonomic function by applying pressure to the foot. However, evidence of walking on foot reflexology path and its influence on autonomic function was limited. PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to ascertain whether walking on a foot reflexology path was feasible and how this would affect autonomic function. METHODS: This was a randomized, counterbalanced, open-label crossover trial. 24 healthy volunteers recruited, aged 18 - 26 years, were randomly assigned into 2 groups (n = 12 in each). After a washout period of 2 days, they switched to receive the opposite phase of intervention. SETTING: A holistic health centre in southern India. INTERVENTION: Walking on a foot reflexology path or walking on a plain surface for 15 minutes. OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures include feasibility, blood pressure, and heart rate variability. Participants were assessed at baseline, during walking, and 5 minutes after intervention. RESULTS: All participants completed the study with no adverse events, indicating the feasibility of the study. Participants were comfortable walking without any deviation in the horizontal and vertical accelerometry. There was a significant decrease in mean RR interval and percentage of differences between adjacent normal heartbeats that are greater than 50 milliseconds during walking on foot reflexology path and walking on plain surface compared to pre-intervention values (P < .05). At post-intervention, a significant increase in mean RR and percentage of differences between adjacent normal heartbeats that are greater than 50 milliseconds (P < .05) was noted, along with a significant decrease in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure only after walking on reflexology path when compared with pre-intervention values (P < .05). CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that walking on foot reflexology path is feasible and potentially helps to regulate cardiac vagal tone by reducing blood pressure and increasing heart rate variability compared to walking on plain surface."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Peripheral artery disease is a highly morbid type of atherosclerotic vascular disease involving the legs and is estimated to affect over 230 million individuals globally. Few therapies improve functional capacity and health-related quality of life in people with lower limb peripheral artery disease. We aimed to evaluate whether semaglutide improves function as measured by walking ability as well as symptoms, quality of life, and outcomes in people with peripheral artery disease and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: STRIDE was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial done at 112 outpatient clinical trial sites in 20 countries in North America, Asia, and Europe. Participants were aged 18 years and older, with type 2 diabetes and peripheral artery disease with intermittent claudication (Fontaine stage IIa, able to walk >200 m) and an ankle-brachial index of less than or equal to 0·90 or toe-brachial index of less than or equal to 0·70. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive web response system to receive subcutaneous semaglutide 1·0 mg once per week for 52 weeks or placebo. The primary endpoint was the ratio to baseline of the maximum walking distance at week 52 measured on a constant load treadmill in the full analysis set. Safety was evaluated in the safety analysis set. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04560998 and is now completed. FINDINGS: From Oct 1, 2020, to July 12, 2024, 1363 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 792 were randomly assigned to semaglutide (n=396) or placebo (n=396). 195 (25%) participants were female and 597 (75%) were male. Median age was 68·0 years (IQR 61·0-73·0). The estimated median ratio to baseline in maximum walking distance at week 52 was significantly greater in the semaglutide group than the placebo group (1·21 [IQR 0·95-1·55] vs 1·08 [0·86-1·36]; estimated treatment ratio 1·13 [95% CI 1·06-1·21]; p=0·0004). Six serious adverse events in five (1%) participants in the semaglutide group and nine serious adverse events in six (2%) participants in the placebo group were possibly or probably treatment related, with the most frequent being serious gastrointestinal events (two events reports by two [1%] in the semaglutide group and five events reported by three [1%] in the placebo group). There were no treatment-related deaths. INTERPRETATION: Semaglutide increased walking distance in patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease and type 2 diabetes. Research implications include the need for future studies to further elucidate mechanisms of benefit and to assess the efficacy and safety in patients with peripheral artery disease who do not have type 2 diabetes.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As the number of people diagnosed with cancer continues to increase, self-management has become crucial for patients recovering from cancer surgery or undergoing chemotherapy. Technology has emerged as a key tool in supporting self-management, particularly through interventions that promote physical activity, which is important for improving health outcomes and quality of life for patients with cancer. Despite the growing availability of digital tools that facilitate physical activity tracking, high-level evidence of their long-term effectiveness remains limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of long-term physical activity on patients with cancer by categorizing them into active and inactive groups based on step count time-series data using the mobile health intervention, the Walkon app (Swallaby Co, Ltd.). METHODS: Patients with cancer who had previously used the Walkon app in a previous randomized controlled trial were chosen for this study. Walking step count data were acquired from the app users. Biometric measurements, including BMI, waist circumference, blood sugar levels, and body composition, along with quality of life (QOL) questionnaire responses (European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Level version and Health-related Quality of Life Instrument with 8 Items), were collected during both the baseline and 6-month follow-up at an outpatient clinic. To analyze step count patterns over time, the concept of sample entropy was used for patient clustering, distinguishing between the active walking group (AWG) and the inactive walking group (IWG). Statistical analysis was performed using the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality, with paired t tests for parametric data, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for nonparametric data, and chi-square tests for categorical variables. RESULTS: The proposed method effectively categorized the AWG (n=137) and IWG (n=75) based on step count trends, revealing significant differences in daily (4223 vs 5355), weekly (13,887 vs 40,247), and monthly (60,178 vs 174,405) step counts. Higher physical activity levels were observed in patients with breast cancer and younger individuals. In terms of biometric measurements, only waist circumference (P=.01) and visceral fat (P=.002) demonstrated a significant improvement exclusively within the AWG. Regarding QOL measurements, aspects such as energy (P=.01), work (P<.003), depression (P=.02), memory (P=.01), and happiness (P=.05) displayed significant improvements solely in the AWG. CONCLUSIONS: This study introduces a novel methodology for categorizing patients with cancer based on physical activity using step count data. Although significant improvements were noted in the AWG, particularly in QOL and specific physical metrics, differences in 6-month change between the AWG and IWG were statistically insignificant. These findings highlight the potential of digital interventions in improving outcomes for patients with cancer, contributing valuable insights into cancer care and self-management.

High-quality, parallel-group RCTs comparing treatment with no treatment are needed. This study aimed to assess the effects of serial casting and exercise interventions on ITW, compared with a control group. Children with ITW aged 3-10 years were randomized into the serial casting (n = 10), the exercise (n = 9), and the wait-list control (n = 10) groups. Primary outcomes were ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) and the Toe Walking Severity Scale (TWSS). The secondary outcomes included pediatric outcomes data collection instrument (PODCI), tandem walk test, and satisfaction from treatment. The patients were assessed before treatment, posttreatment, 1-month posttreatment (MPT), 3 MPT, and 6 MPT. The control group was followed up until the 1 MPT assessment. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov under the number NCT06010485. No differences were found between the treatment groups in ankle ROM and TWSS at any follow-up points. The control group showed less improvement in the TWSS compared with the intervention groups. Both intervention groups demonstrated significant intragroup improvements over time. All groups improved in ankle ROM, TWSS, and the Tandem Walk Scale, but only the intervention groups showed improvements in PODCI scores. Treatment satisfaction was similar among the intervention groups. Both interventions had comparable rates of side effects and adherence. Both treatment groups demonstrated greater effectiveness than the control group, with no significant differences observed between the treatment groups."

AIM: We aim to study the brain function characteristics in children with CP during walking. APPROACH: The cortical activation, functional connectivity, information flow, and dynamic state transitions of 17 children with CP and 13 healthy children (HC) were analyzed in the resting and walking states. RESULTS: The motor cortex (MC) of HC is significantly activated in the walking state, whereas both the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and MC of children with CP are significantly activated. The resting brain functional connectivity of children with CP decreased and showed higher global efficiency and modularity and lower clustering coefficients and local efficiency. During walking, the brain network of children with CP was difficult to maintain a stable global high-connectivity state so the local high-connectivity state became the main connectivity state. For children with CP, more brain resources were allocated to the non-dominant MC during walking, whereas more brain resources were allocated to the dominant MC in HC. CONCLUSIONS: These indicators reflect the characteristics of brain activation, network connectivity, and information regulation in children with CP, which provide the theoretical basis for targeted rehabilitation treatment."

      "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of human gait, including both motions and forces, is vital to promote human health and performance. Conventional gait analysis requires laboratory-based experiments and physics-based simulations to quantify gait dynamics and analyze how dynamics change with treatment, training, injury, and disease. However, the high costs associated with experiments and simulations has confined the use of gait dynamics to small-scale research studies. While deep learning models offer low-cost prediction, and can be highly expressive in fitting large-scale data, existing models have primarily been trained on small datasets with homogenous demographics and focused on predicting a single output. To overcome these limitations, we developed GaitDynamics, a generative foundation model for human gait that is trained on a large dataset with diverse participant demographics and gait patterns. GaitDynamics can be used for diverse tasks with different inputs, outputs, and clinical applications, which we illustrate in three examples: i) estimating ground reaction forces from kinematics with high accuracy and robustness even with missing kinematic data and for populations not included in the training dataset, ii) predicting the influence of gait modifications on knee loading without the need for resource-intensive experiments, and iii) predicting kinematic and force changes that occur with increasing running speeds. These representative tasks demonstrate that GaitDynamics makes accurate and rapid predictions in seconds based on flexible inputs, showing its potential to assess and optimize gait for injury prevention, disease treatment, and performance coaching. All data, code, and trained models are publicly shared."

Blood flow-restricted exercise training (BFRET) may induce motor learning and boost the facilitatory effect of exercise training (ET). OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effects of BFRET on post-stroke hemi paretic lower extremity function and walking capacity recovery. METHODOLOGY: This randomized clinical trial was conducted from September 2021 to October 2022 at the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University in China. Participants were randomized 1:1 to BFRET or ET, each involving 30 minutes of training twice per day for 4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The main outcomes were manual muscle testing (MMT) and Fugl-Meyer assessment scale-lower extremity (FMA-LE), the timed up and go test (TUGT), Outcomes were assessed by blinded raters after 4 weeks of training. RESULTS: 40 participants mean [SD] age 48.79[12.58] years, 30 males [75%], 20 were randomized to BFRET and 20 to ET. The mean (SD) time since stroke was 2.5 (1.3) years. The MMT scores showed greater strength by within-group comparisons and superior changes in hip flexion and plantar flexion in the BFRET group. CONCLUSIONS: BFRET is superior to ET alone in enhancing muscle mass and strength in the lower extremities. BFRET may improve the function of the lower extremities through physiological adaptations for muscle hypertrophy.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Adults without dementia. METHODS: Six English databases were searched from inception to January 2025. Longitudinal studies that simultaneously investigate the relationship between a decline in grip strength or walking speed and cognitive impairment or dementia were eligible. The meta-analysis was conducted using Stata 17.0. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach were used to assess the quality of evidence in the included studies. RESULTS: A total of 2779 articles were identified through the search strategy. After removing duplicate titles and completing screening, 10 studies were included. Random effects analysis revealed that decreases in physical function (walking speed: hazard ratio [HR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.13-1.60) and grip strength: HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.14-1.49) were significantly associated with decreases in cognitive ability, and this correlation became even more pronounced when pace and grip strength were assessed jointly (HR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.20-6.17). The results of the subgroup analysis revealed that the study location, follow-up time, cognitive assessment method, sex ratio of the subjects, and other factors affected the results of the study. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This study suggests that grip strength and walking speed are important predictors of cognitive decline and dementia, and highlights the significance of the comprehensive assessment. Early intervention before middle-aged and older adults enter the clinical stage of dementia is needed, which requires standardized and rigorous assessment.The sequential relationships between hand strength and walking speed in relation to different developmental stages of dementia, as well as how they can be integrated with objective indicators to facilitate diagnosis, need to be further investigated."

A total of 35 Caucasian children with obesity (aged 8-13) were enrolled in the study and tested before (T0) and after (T1) a 12-week online supervised exercise training protocol: cardiovascular fitness (by means of 6MWT), metabolic biochemical profile, lifestyle (with ad hoc questionnaires focusing on physical activity, nutrition, sedentariness, sleep hours and quality, health perception) and Cardiac Autonomic Regulation (CAR) were assessed. Spearman correlations between the variations in the studied outcomes were explored. After intervention, the distance covered during 6MWT significantly increased (p < 0.001), and nutrition quality improved slightly but significantly (p = 0.03). The improvement in the 6MWT performance was shown to be significantly correlatee with the reduction of insulin levels (r = -0.455; p = 0.02), HOMA-IR Index (r = -0.452; p = 0.02), total cholesterol values (r = -0.549; p = 0.004) and Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP) (r = 0.422; p = 0.04). Moreover, there was a significant correlation between the improvement in 6MWT and health perception (r = 0.578; p = 0.002). We observed that the improvement in the 6MWT performance correlates with better metabolic profile after exercise training in children with obesity suggesting the goodness of this simple test on unveil changes in pathogenetic processes underlying obesity.",

      "abstract": "Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a highly effective surgical intervention for alleviating pain and restoring function in patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis. Walking ability, a critical measure of post-operative success, directly impacts patients' independence, mobility, and quality of life. This review comprehensively examines the factors influencing walking ability after TKA, encompassing pre-operative, surgical, and post-operative considerations. Pre-operative factors, such as patient demographics, functional status, psychological well-being, and comorbidities, significantly shape post-operative outcomes. Surgical techniques, including the choice of approach, implant design, alignment, and minimally invasive or robotic-assisted methods, also play a pivotal role in determining walking ability. Post-operative rehabilitation, particularly early mobilization, physical therapy, and exercise protocol adherence, is essential for optimizing recovery. Long-term outcomes reveal that, while most patients experience significant improvements in walking ability, some face persistent limitations due to age, comorbidities, or suboptimal surgical results. Emerging technologies, such as wearable devices, robotic-assisted surgery, and personalized rehabilitation programs, offer promising avenues for enhancing post-operative walking ability. Biological augmentation techniques, like platelet-rich plasma and stem cell therapy, are also being explored to improve tissue healing and functional recovery. This review underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach to maximize walking ability and overall satisfaction after TKA, synthesizing evidence from clinical studies, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews. Future research should focus on refining surgical techniques, advancing rehabilitation strategies, and integrating personalized medicine to improve outcomes."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: The GO-TRYKE® Kid (GTK®) is an arm- and leg-powered tricycle which, in addition to promoting strength, endurance, and coordination, aims to reactivate the central pattern generators of the spine for locomotion through cyclical movements. The present study investigated the effects of GTK® training on walking ability, GTK® riding performance, and health-related quality of life in children with walking disabilities. Methods: Nine children trained with the device twice a week for nine weeks. Short- and long-term effects on walking ability were measured using the timed up and go test (TUG) and the two-minute walk test (2MWT). GTK® riding performance and health-related quality of life were compared before and after the intervention period. Results: While no long-term effect on walking was found, a significant short-term effect on functional walking ability was observed (p = 0.009). GTK® riding performance improved significantly over the training period (p = 0.004). There were no significant changes in health-related quality of life. Conclusions: GTK® enables children with walking disabilities to participate in cycling as part of play and sport. Further research is required to investigate its functional and participatory effects, as there is significant potential to improve physical activity and overall well-being in this population."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a critical exercise-induced modulator of various neuroplasticity processes, including adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Environmental affordance for physical activity is a novel theory that aims to increase the BDNF through walking or climbing stairs, stimulated by the urban and interior environment. In a systematic review, this paper explores the association between walking, as a structured or free-living form of physical activity, and changes in the BDNF in humans with healthy locomotion. METHOD: A systematic review with a registered protocol, INPLASY2024110093, and following the PRISMA guidelines, includes English-language original research articles on adult and older adult human subjects who are locomotor-healthy, studies on walking as a structured exercise or free-living physical activity that is presented in a non-combined intervention, and must report changes in the BDNF as a dependent variable. The search was conducted using three databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, resulting in 21 eligible studies. RESULTS: This systematic review finds that the impact of walking on the BDNF is evidenced, but subject to moderate to high intensities in single bouts. At the same time, the long-term effects are yet to be fully understood, potentially due to the uptake of the BDNF for functional brain improvements, neuroplasticity processes, or muscle repair, instead of an accumulation of the BDNF itself, yet still confirm the important role of the BDNF for neurosustainability. Age and environmental factors such as heat are also found to affect the increase in the BDNF. The narrative synthesis provides elaborate explanations for understanding those complex dynamics before reaching future conclusions on the impact of walking or environmental affordance for physical activity on the changes in the BDNF concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review highlights the potential role played by moderate- and high-intensity walking as a lifestyle intervention that can be utilised through the built environment to promote adaptive brain changes, through the sustainable regulation of the BDNF."

However, how the cognitive load affects the stride-to-stride variability in the lower extremities throughout walking in those with and without FAI using nonlinear evaluation tools is unknown.MethodsEighteen volunteers with FAI and 19 healthy individuals were recruited for this study. The participants walked on a motor-driven treadmill at their preferred speed, with or without completing a cognitive task involving an auditory Stroop test. A passive retroreflective marker motion-capture system recorded the lower extremity gait kinematics in the sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes. The largest Lyapunov exponent (LyE) characterizes the variability of the temporal structure in walking patterns. Cognitive task performance was analyzed using error ratio and average reaction time in walking and sitting conditions.ResultsDuring walking with cognitive load, the group with FAI exhibited lower values for the LyE in knee kinematics in the sagittal plane than the normal walking (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44-0.92, P < .001). During normal walking (single task), participants with FAI demonstrated higher knee flexion-extension LyE (95% CI: 0.52-0.93, P = .04) than healthy people. The 2 groups had no significant differences regarding the LyE values for other kinematic variables (P > .05). Regarding cognitive performance, both FAI and healthy groups had remarkably longer reaction times (P < .001) while walking (mean ± SD: 0.92 ± 0.06) compared with the sitting condition (mean ± SD: 0.77 ± 0.03).ConclusionThe reduced variability observed in the walking patterns of individuals with FAI during walking with an added cognitive load suggests a compensatory mechanism due to sensorimotor constraints, highlighting the altered motor control strategies. Dual task and cognitive training may help correct these patterns and improve responses.Levels of Evidence:Level II."

Patients at least 2 months post-stroke, Mini-Mental State Test > 24, and able to walk 10 meters with or without walking aids were included. Functional mobility was assessed with Timed Up and Go. Participants completed TUG twice: with and without walking aids. Balance was measured using the Berg Balance Scale. The mean Timed Up and Go value without aids was 50.44 ± 18.22 sec, and with aids was 42.32 ± 14.97 sec. Paired-sample T-test revealed a significant difference between Timed Up and Go values with and without aids (p = 0.01). TUG scores with and without aids and Berg Balance Scale scores showed high negative correlations (r = -0.534, r = -0.789). The use of walking aids improves Timed Up and Go scores in stroke patients. Based on these results, whether the patient uses a walking aid should be considered for accurate assessment, interpretation, and treatment of mobility and balance."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Lung cancer remains a major health concern in Japan, with over 126,000 cases diagnosed in 2019. Surgery is the primary treatment for stage I-III non-small-cell lung cancer. The 6-min walk test is widely used to assess physical endurance before and after surgery, with preoperative distances below 500 m associated with prolong hospital stays. Postoperatively, endurance typically decreases by 50-100 m. Early mobilization is critical to prevent this decline; however, no clear consensus exists on optimal rehabilitation protocols after lung cancer surgery. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined the relationship between early postoperative walking distance and clinical outcomes in 104 patients who underwent lung cancer surgery between 2020 and 2023. Physical function was assessed using the 6-min Walk Test before admission and before discharge. RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between the distance walked within the first 24 h after surgery and the pre- and postoperative 6-min walk test performance. However, no significant association was observed between early walking distance and length of hospital stay or postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Early mobilization after lung cancer surgery aligns closely with preoperative endurance levels, suggesting that improving preoperative physical function can enhance postoperative recovery and reduce complications. Further research is needed to standardize the rehabilitation protocols."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and its treatment cause side effects in paediatric patients which increase the risk of walking inability, limiting functional independence and quality of life. However, the incidence of walking inability, the time until onset and potential risk factors are unknown. METHODS: We retrospectively retrieved data in ALL patients (≤ 18 years). Walking inability was defined as the incompetence to walk independently from diagnosis until the end of early treatment. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to estimate the time until walking inability. To assess the effect of risk factors, we estimated a Cox regression model and performed a landmark analysis. RESULTS: In total, 226 patients (age median, 5.5 years; interquartile range, 3.4-11.7) were included. Walking inability was experienced by 15.0% at diagnosis and 28.3% during induction/consolidation1. Age at diagnosis (hazard ratio (HR) 0.901; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.847-0.959) was a risk factor during induction/consolidation1. The landmark analysis at end of induction identified age at diagnosis (HR 0.898; 95% CI 0.830-0.971), delta weight-to-height Z-score (HR 0.577; 95% CI 0.410-0.812) and duration of hospitalizations (HR 1.076; 95% CI 1.005-1.152) as risk factors during consolidation1. CONCLUSION: Fifteen percent experienced walking inability at diagnosis and 28.3% temporarily stopped walking during early treatment. This is concerning because walking inability leads to isolation and loss of independence. Patients with younger age, decreasing weight and longer hospitalizations during the first month of treatment were at highest risk. Informing patients and parents about the occurrence of walking inability and studies on physiotherapy and nutritional interventions are indicated.",

This study investigated the effects of a 12-week fitness walking (FW) programme on risk factors for metabolic syndrome and sex hormone levels in postmenopausal women. Our study hypothesised that FW would reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome in this population, with correlated changes in sex hormone levels. METHODS AND RESULTS: Postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to FW (n = 15, age: 60.87 ± 5.73 years, body mass index (BMI): 23.58 ± 2.88 kg m-2) or control (CON) groups (n = 15, age: 60.40 ± 3.79 years, BMI: 24.97 ± 3.07 kg m-2). The FW group engaged in a 12-week FW programme (60 min/session, five times/week, 50%-60 % VO2max, aerobic training). The CON group maintained their usual lifestyle. After the intervention, the FW group exhibited decreased levels of triglycerides (TG), fasting blood glucose (FBG), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP, P = 0.009) and waist circumference (WC), and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, P = 0.001). The CON group demonstrated increased TG (P = 0.001), FBG, SBP, DBP and WC, and decreased HDL-C. Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) was negatively correlated with TG and SBP in the CON group pre- and post-intervention. Among all participants, there was a significant negative correlation between SHBG and TG, BMI, and WC pre-intervention; only TG remained significantly correlated with SHBG post-intervention. CONCLUSION: A 12-week FW training programme effectively controlled metabolic syndrome risk factors in postmenopausal women, and a significant relationship between metabolic syndrome risk factors and sex hormone levels was observed."

Both medical and behavioral treatments for toe walking have been evaluated. In the current study, we surveyed caregivers of individuals who engage in toe walking about their use of various medical and behavioral treatments. Results suggest that the use of medical treatments is more common, and most respondents reported that they were unaware that behavioral treatment of toe walking is an option. Most respondents reported that the hypothesized function of toe walking by their child is automatic positive reinforcement, although more than half attributed toe-walking to a disorder (e.g., autism spectrum disorder), a physical cause (e.g., tight muscles), or reported they did not know why their child engaged in toe walking. Surgery and increased response effort via weighted boots were the medical and behavioral treatments, respectively, perceived to be most effective in treating toe walking. To assist the behavior analytic community in managing toe-walking cases, we also provide some specific recommendations for practitioners, including a description of the advantages and disadvantages of behavioral treatments for toe walking and a decision tree for behavior analysts unfamiliar with the literature on this topic."

We used concurrent multiple probes across participants design, with RESA checks, to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. We measured the correct steps during probe sessions, the rate per minute of correct steps during the training, the ankle joint's passive range of motion, and social validity, measured through caregiver questionnaires before and after the intervention. The results indicated a decrease in TW across all participants, with a beneficial effect on the participants' gait patterns and overall physical mobility. It also underscored the potential for applying such an intervention to improve the daily lives of children with ASD.

The main aim of this study was to explore whether the 2-minute walk test (2MWT) could be substituted for the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) as a measure of walking capacity in people with PD. We also sought to investigate construct and known-groups validity of the 2MWT. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis based on data from the Supported Home Training in Everyday Life for Parkinson Disease trial was conducted in a hospital setting. Sixty-three people with idiopathic, mild to moderate PD (29 women; mean age = 69.2 years) were included. Spatiotemporal gait parameters during the 2MWT and the 6MWT were captured by wearable sensors. Linear regression was used to analyze the association between distances walked, whereas paired-samples t tests and repeated-measures analysis of variance were used to explore mean differences in gait parameters. RESULTS: Distance walked over the 2MWT was very strongly associated with the 6MWT. Gait speed was higher during the shorter test, and several speed-related parameters significantly differed between the tests. There was a trend over the 6MWT, whereby participants performed better during the last 2 minutes of the test. Analyses revealed convergent, discriminant, and known-groups validity of the 2MWT. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the 2MWT adequately captures walking capacity among people with mild to moderate PD and demonstrates robust convergent validity and ability to discriminate between people at different levels of disease severity. IMPACT: The 2MWT is a sufficient and valid alternative for physical therapists who wish to assess walking capacity in people with mild to moderate PD."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Idiopathic Toe Walking (ITW) is a pediatric gait disorder characterized by persistent toe-to-heel ambulation in the absence of neurological, orthopedic, or developmental abnormalities. While spatio-temporal parameters often remain within normal ranges, subtle but clinically significant kinematic deviations may underlie compensatory mechanisms that sustain gait functionality. This study aims to evaluate spatio-temporal and sagittal plane kinematic differences between children with ITW and typically developing peers using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM). Methods: A cohort of 30 children with ITW and 30 typically developing peers aged 6-12 years participated in this study. Spatio-temporal variables, including step length, cadence, stride length, walking speed, single support phase, and swing phase, were analyzed using a three-dimensional motion capture system. Sagittal plane kinematics of the pelvis, hip, knee, and ankle were compared between groups using SPM to identify significant deviations across the gait cycle. Results: Significant differences were identified in the single support and swing phases, with higher values observed in the ITW group (p < 0.05). Sagittal plane kinematics revealed a consistent reduction in anterior pelvic tilt (p = 0.002), reduced hip and knee flexion during stance and swing phases (p < 0.001), and excessive ankle plantarflexion during early stance and terminal swing phases (p < 0.001). The plantarflexion observed at the end of the gait cycle corresponded to early gait phases due to methodological considerations of the coordinate-based event detection algorithm. Conclusions: Children with ITW demonstrate distinct spatio-temporal adaptations, including increased single support and swing phases, along with reduced walking velocity compared to typically developing peers. These findings, coupled with significant sagittal plane kinematic deviations, suggest altered neuromuscular control and joint mechanics. These insights highlight the importance of detailed kinematic analyses to identify biomechanical deficits and inform targeted interventions. Future research should explore the long-term musculoskeletal consequences of these deviations and optimize therapeutic strategies, such as physical therapy and orthotic interventions, to improve gait functionality and quality of life."

Appetite improvement occurred after two sessions and coincided with the onset of walking in the exoskeleton. DISCUSSION: The recovery of appetite during exoskeleton-assisted walking could be linked to autonomic and visceral afferent improvements. However, this observation is exploratory, and other factors, such as mood enhancement from experiencing walking, may have contributed. Further studies are needed to investigate these mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Toe walking is prevalent among children, affecting 5% to 24% of the pediatric population. Clinicians rely on parental reports of frequency of toe walking to guide clinical decision making and outcomes assessment. However, recall accuracy and differing environments challenge the reliability of parental reports. This study aims to validate parental reports against quantitative in-shoe device measurements (NURVV/RUN). METHODS: Twenty children with persistent idiopathic toe walking (ITWp) (mean age: 9.6y; 13 males, 7 females) from 8 pediatric orthopaedic specialty care sites participated in this multicenter study. Parents assessed toe walking frequency using a 6-point scale, while children wore NURVV/RUN insoles for 8 hours/day over 7 days. Insole sensors recorded foot strike patterns (rearfoot, midfoot, and forefoot), which were classified using the same severity scale. Agreement between parental reports and NURVV data was assessed using weighted Kappa statistics (P<0.05). RESULTS: Before intervention, children with ITWp exhibited daily walking patterns: 61.7% forefoot, 15.3% midfoot, and 22.8% hindfoot contact. Agreement analysis showed substantial agreement (k=0.688, P<0.001) for combined forefoot and midfoot contacts and fair agreement (k=0.381, P<0.005) for isolated forefoot contact. CONCLUSION: Parental reports of toe walking prevalence in their children are relatively accurate, supporting their use in clinical management. However, quantitative in-shoe devices provide a more objective and quantitative understanding of ITWp frequency and have the potential to guide clinical decision-making and outcomes assessment children with ITWp. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II-diagnostic study. See instructions to authors for a complete description of levels of evidence."

      "abstract": "The beam walk is widely used to study coordination and balance in rodents. While the task has ethological validity, the main endpoints of \"foot slip counts\" and \"time to cross\" are prone to human-rater variability and offer limited sensitivity and specificity. We asked if machine learning-based methods could reveal previously hidden, but biologically relevant, insights from the task. Marker-less pose estimation, using DeepLabCut, was deployed to label 13 anatomical key points on mice traversing the beam. Next, we automated classical endpoint detection, including foot slips, with high recall (> 90%) and precision (> 80%). Using data derived from key point tracking, a total of 395 features were engineered and a random forest classifier deployed that, together with skeletal visualizations, could test for group differences and identify determinant features. This workflow, named Forestwalk, uncovered pharmacological treatment effects in C57BL/6J mice, revealed phenotypes in transgenic mice used to study Angelman syndrome and SLC6A1-related neurodevelopmental disorder, and will facilitate a deeper understanding of how the brain controls balance in health and disease.",

Moreover, positive affect and pain acceptance may also contribute to the development of lasting physical and cognitive resources that can support the maintenance of exercise behavior. AIM: The aim of this study has been to examine the impact of psychosocial variables (commitment to physical activity (walking), positive affect) on depression and activity acceptance among patients with Fibromyalgia (FM). DESIGN: Cross-selectional correlational study. METHOD: Commitment to physical activity (walking), positive affect, depression and activity acceptance were evaluated in 132 FM women. Two models were tested to analyze mediation and a moderated mediation effects. RESULTS: The mediating role of depression between walking and activity acceptance was corroborated regarding the subjective measure of walking. The moderated mediation model found that the effect of walking on activity acceptance was mediated by depression at medium (value: .19; ß = 2.50, [95% CI = 1.19/4.05]) and high levels (value: 9.87; ß =4.46, p < .001, [95% CI = 2.34/6.86]) of positive affect. The indirect effect of walking on activity acceptance via depression was stronger in individuals with higher positive affect. CONCLUSIONS: Different levels of positive affect played a contextual role when trying to prevent the effect of depression on activity acceptance in women that walked. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Positive affect is a key variable to prevent the effects of depression on activity acceptance in FM women that walk with the goal to exercise. Interventions from positive psychology, cognitive behavioural therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy can be very useful in this context."

METHODS: We searched 12 databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, Web of Science, EBSCO host, Ovid, Scopus, ClinicalTrial.gov, and several top ranked Chinese databases, including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, CBMdisc, VIP Database, ChiCTR. The search has no starting time limit and the deadline is April 9, 2024. Randomized controlled trials and pseudo-random controlled trials were included. The two authors independently screened the literature and evaluated the quality of the study using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Meta analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.4 and Stata 17.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 8 studies involving 508 patients were included. Meta-analysis results showed that compared with supervised exercise therapy (SET), supervised NW was not associated with an increase in maximum walking distance (MWD) and claudication distance (CD) in PAD patients, whether during treadmill tests or 6-minute walk tests (6-MWT), and the results were not statistically significant. In terms of increasing exercise duration, SET was significantly higher than supervised NW and the results were statistically significant (SMD =  -0.41, 95% Cl: -0.72 to -0.09, Z =  2.54, P =  0.01 <  0.05). Among the 8 studies included, 2 studies had control groups that were not part of the supervised exercise program and were different, therefore no meta-analysis was conducted. CONCLUSIONS: In PAD patients, supervised NW is no significant difference in walking ability compared to SET. NW presents a viable option when SET is not available.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dual-task walking is used as a treatment, for gait assessment, and as an outcome measure in Parkinson's disease (PD). Movement smoothness, i.e. its non-intermittency, is a movement cardinal feature. This study assesses whether dual-tasking reduces gait smoothness in PD alongside reducing speed, one of its well-known effects. METHODS: The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, instrumented with an inertial sensor fixed to the back, was administered to 33 PD patients (15 females; age: median = 71 years; IQR = 10) to assess two walking types: straight-walking and turning-while-walking. The TUG test was completed in single-task and two dual-task modalities: cognitive (doing successive subtractions) and motor (holding a water glass). The angular speed spectral arc length metric (SPARC) and the Ln-DimensionLess Jerk (LDLJ), two smoothness measures quantifying the peaks and dips in the speed profile, were measured, along with the trunk angular velocity and the foot strikes number. ANOVA was used for hypothesis testing and estimated marginal means for post-hoc tests and effect sizes (ES). RESULTS: In straight-walking and turning, cognitive and motor dual tasks decreased gait speed (ES range = [0.476, 1.379]; p < 0.01) and increased the step number (ES = [0.402, 0.927]; p < 0.05). SPARC (ES = [0.221, 0.493]; p < 0.05) and angular LDLJ (ES = [0.451, 0.929]; p < 0.01) were lower in the two dual-task conditions in both phases, indicating reduced gait smoothness than in single-task. This worsening of gait smoothness was partially confirmed after ruling out the dual-task effect on speed and step number. In particular, anterior-posterior SPARC during turning was still low in cognitive (ES = 0.351; p < 0.01) and motor (ES = 0.283; p < 0.05) dual tasks. CONCLUSIONS: In PD, dual-tasking decreases gait speed and increases the step number when walking straight and turning while walking. Independently of these effects, dual-tasking also reduces gait smoothness. As an independent feature of movement, when dual-task walking is the outcome measure, improving smoothness may represent a novel treatment aim in PD. As long as it is instrumented with an inertial sensor, the TUG test is valuable for studying different walking types.

      "abstract": "AIMS: This post-hoc analysis from the Behavioural Intervention by allied health professionals to promote Physical activity (BIP) trial examined the relationship between depression and step count and walking capacity over two years in people with peripheral artery disease (PAD). METHODS: BIP included participants with walking impairment due to PAD followed up at 4, 12 and 24 months to measure step count over 7 days using an accelerometer and six-minute walking distance. The relationships between depression at entry with step count and walking distance during follow-up were assessed using linear mixed effects models. RESULTS: At entry, 29 (14.5%) of the 200 participants had depression being treated with anti-depressant medication. Participants diagnosed with depression were more likely to be female (13 of 29, 44.8%) than those not diagnosed with depression (43 of 171, 25.1%). Over 24 months follow-up, daily step count progressively decreased in participants with depression (mean [SD] 4406 (2266) at entry to 3888 (2555) at 24 months) as compared to no change in participants without depression (mean (SD) 5271 (2526) at entry compared to 5120 (2446) at 24 months), inter-group difference p = 0.010. No significant difference in change in six-minute walking distance over 2 years was found between participants with and those without depression. CONCLUSION: Depression is associated with greater decline in self-regulated walking in patients with PAD. Effective treatments for depression are needed which help promote physical activity in people with PAD."

DESIGN: Sixty stroke patients (67.13 ± 11.36 years; 37 males and 23 females) undergoing physical therapy were recruited from C Hospital in Seoul, Korea. Patients were randomly assigned to either the W-RAGT group (n = 30) or the TGT group (n = 30). Both groups received 30-minute training sessions three times a week for eight weeks. Balance ability was assessed using the L-symmetry, and BBS and motor recovery by FMA-LE. Cadence, step length, and stride length were measured to evaluate walking ability. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 16 weeks. RESULTS: After 8 weeks of treatment, the W-RAGT group demonstrated significant functional improvements in motor ability and balance (FMA-LE, p < 0.001; L-symmetry, p = 0.049; BBS, p < 0.001) and walking ability (cadence, p = 0.017; step length, p = 0.038; stride length, p = 0.042). At the 16 weeks follow-up, the W-RAGT group maintained significant gains in motor ability and balance (FMA-LE, p < 0.001; L-symmetry, p = 0.025; BBS, p = 0.011) and walking ability (cadence, p < 0.001; step length, p = 0.025; stride length, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The overground wearable robotic device used in this study, W-RAGT was found to be more effective than TGT in improving motor ability and balance, and walking ability in stroke patients."

Four female subjects (mean age=53 years) with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) participated in this study and completed a total of sixteen sessions (1-hour/session) gait training in a standard therapy gym either using a RE supervised by a physical therapist (PT) trained with RE therapy (2 subjects) or with the CGT (2 subjects) supervised by a PT. Outcome measures (obstacle avoidance, ability to track augmented cues, and average walking speed while completing these dual-tasks) were measured for both groups on a smart, instrumented treadmill (C-Mill, Motekforce, Netherland) pre- and post-intervention without the RE. Overall, individuals with MS who underwent training with RE demonstrated improved walking adaptability (obstacle avoidance and augmented cues tracking) with no adverse events during the study, and improved average walking speed post training compared to baseline.Clinical Relevance- These preliminary results from four individuals with MS suggest that gait training with robotic exoskeleton may present an effective method for improving walking adaptability and average walking speed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity in adolescents is a major public health issue. Schools are important settings for physical activity interventions. The WISH Study was a peer-led, school-based walking intervention that aimed to increase physical activity levels of adolescent girls. This study uses the RE-AIM Framework to present the process evaluation of the WISH Study with a focus on factors that affected participation, motivation, and enjoyment of the intervention. METHODS: Pupils (n589 12-14 years) were recruited from 18 schools in the border region of Ireland and Northern Ireland. In intervention schools (n9), older pupils (15-18 years) were trained as walk leaders and led pupils (12-14 years) in brisk walks (10-15 min) during the school day, across the school year (2021-22). Questionnaires to measure self-efficacy for walking and physical activity, health-related quality of life and reasons for engaging in physical activity were administered throughout the intervention. At the end of the intervention focus groups were held with pupils, and interviews conducted with teachers and walk leaders. Attendance at walks was monitored by walk leaders. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively, and qualitative analysis was undertaken using thematic analysis. Themes were reported under RE-AIM indicators (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance). RESULTS: Pupils in the intervention schools (n286) were representative of adolescent girls in Northern Ireland and Ireland, in terms of their activity level. At baseline, 15% of these pupils met the recommended physical activity guidelines of 60 min moderate-vigorous physical activity per day, as measured by accelerometers. The total number of walks reported per school ranged from 2 to 104 across intervention schools. One quarter of pupils (n74, 26%) never attended a walk and 15% (n23) of walk leaders did not lead a walk. Pupils and walk leaders self-reported improvements in their physical health, mental well-being, and social relationships, and walk leaders reported gaining transferrable skills. Implementation was aided by school support in some schools, although barriers such as COVID-19, lack of time, harsh weather, inadequate facilities for indoor walks, and walk leader availability, were identified. Staff engagement was a key driver for the maintenance of walks. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a promising feasibility study and a comprehensive walk leader training programme, the extent to which the intervention was adopted and implemented varied, suggesting future school-based physical activity interventions need to consider individual school contexts to ensure intervention fidelity.

This study evaluated the effects of gamified versus pedometer-based walking interventions on these patients' physical activity, physical function, fatigue, sleep quality, and hemodynamics. METHODS: A quasi-experimental single-blind study was conducted in three groups (two intervention and one control groups). It was carried out at the hemodialysis department in Mansoura University Hospital, Egypt, from October 2022 to 2023. A total of 94 patients were divided randomly into gamified (n = 31), pedometer (n = 31), and control (n = 32) groups. Randomization was done by dialysis scheduled time (first shift: pedometer group, second shift: gamified group, and third shift control group) rather than at the individual level, and the allocation ratio was approximately 1:1:1. The gamified group received a twelve-week smartphone-based gamified walking intervention, while the pedometer group received a twelve-week pedometer-based walking intervention. The control group did not receive any intervention. Step count, fatigue, sleep quality, physical function, and hemodynamic parameters were evaluated at baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention. RESULT: Post-intervention results indicated that patients in the gamified group significantly improved their step count, fatigue, and sleep levels compared to both the pedometer and control groups (P < 0.001). However, the groups had no statistically significant differences in physical function or hemodynamics. CONCLUSION: Hemodialysis patients who participated in a short-term, smartphone-based gamified walking intervention experienced increased step counts, reduced fatigue, and improved sleep quality.

      "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a muscle disease that can lead to a decrease in muscle mass and strength. Patients with sarcopenia usually have gait disorders and a higher risk of falls. At present, muscle activation of lower limb during walking in patients with sarcopenia is not clear, making it difficult to find effective rehabilitation training. In this study, we aim to investigate muscle activation of lower limb during walking in elderly individuals with sarcopenia. We collected surface EMG signals from the tibialis anterior (TA), lateral gastrocnemius (GL), rectus femoris (RF), and biceps femoris (BF) muscles during walking. Results showed that differences of muscle activation between sarcopenia patients and healthy elderly during walking are mainly reflected in the shank. Specially, RMS of TA was statistically significantly higher in sarcopenia patients during swing phase (p=0.005). Modulation index of GL was significantly higher in sarcopenia patients during pre-swing phase (p=0.01). Coactivation index of TA-GL was significantly lower in sarcopenia patients during single stance phase. A significant strong correlation was also observed between RMS of GL and step length (r=0.863, p=0.012) in sarcopenia patients. These results indicated that differences of muscle activation in shank may contribute to gait disorders in sarcopenia patients. It is recommended that exercise intervention strategies for sarcopenia patients should focus on shank muscles.",

Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is approved by The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for managing foot drop in upper motor neuron disorders, however there is limited evidence for its use in CP. We discuss a cohort of 26 patients with CP using FES for a 3 month period and longitudinal data for a subset of 11 patients that have used FES for at least 4 years. Patients were referred for the following common barriers to walking: reported falls (54%), foot drop (46%) and tripping (15%). After application of FES at baseline, there was a small clinically insignificant orthotic effect on walking speed (0.01 m/s on/off difference). However, orthotic effects became statistically and clinically significant at three months of continuous use (0.12 m/s on/off difference, p = 0.01) and in the subset of 11 patients this remained significant at four years (0.24 m/s on/off difference, p = 0.01). Patient reported walking satisfaction (numerical rating scale) improved when comparing no-FES versus FES at three months and at four years. FES is a safe, cost-effective treatment option and should be considered, for adults with CP who have walking difficulties.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), a common complication of diabetes mellitus, is associated with peripheral nerve damage, leading to balance impairments, postural instability, and reduced mobility. Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive interventions that target multiple deficits simultaneously. Evidence suggests that exercise programs combining balance, proprioception, strength, and reaction time training can improve postural stability, enhance mobility, and alleviate pain in individuals with DPN. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the effects of multisystem exercises and conventional exercises on balance, postural stability, mobility, and walking speed and to reduce pain in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. METHODS: This double-blinded, two-arm parallel design randomized controlled trial was conducted at DHQ Hospital, Pakpattan, Pakistan. A total of 50 participants who met the inclusion criteria were recruited using the nonprobability convenience sampling technique. They were randomly assigned to either a multisystem physical exercise (MPE) group (n = 26) and a conventional exercise group (n = 24). The MPE program included balance, proprioception, strength, and reaction time training, while the control group received conventional exercises, consisted of strength, balance, stretching, and range of motion exercises. Both groups underwent 30 min intervention sessions, 3 times per week, for 8 weeks. The outcome measures used for assessing the balance, postural stability, mobility, and pain included the Berg balance scale (BBS), functional reach test (FRT), time up and go test (TUG), 10 min walk test (10-MWT), and numeric pain rating scale (NPRS). The data was analyzed using SPSS version 26. RESULTS: Significant group and time interactions were observed for all outcome measures including BBS, FRT, TUG, 10-MWT, and NPRS (p < 0.001). The between-group analysis also revealed significant differences between the multisystem physical exercise group and the conventional exercise group at both the 4th week and 8th week for BBS, FRT, TUG, 10-MWT, and NPRS (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The study concluded that multisystem exercises resulted in significant improvement in balance, postural stability, mobility, and walking speed, along with reduction in pain, compared to conventional exercises in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This randomized controlled study was registered prospectively on November 11th, 2023 with the ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06130917).",

However, detailed insights into effects on lipid and lipoprotein subclasses and functionalities, and markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction are lacking. METHODS: In this randomised cross-over study, 24 sedentary overweight/obese individuals followed two 4-day activity regimens under free-living conditions. The \"Sit\" regimen involved 13.5 h/day sitting, 1.4 h/day standing, and 0.7 h/day self-perceived light-intensity walking. During the \"SitLess\" regimen these activities lasted respectively 7.6, 4.0, and 4.3 h/day. Blood samples collected after each regimen were analysed for markers of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. RESULTS: Compared to the Sit regimen, SitLess increased serum cholesterol concentrations in HDL (0.06 mmol/l, p = 0.002), large HDL A (0.05 mmol/l, p < 0.001), medium HDL B (0.02 mmol/l, p < 0.001) and small HDL C (0.09 mmol/l, p < 0.001), LHDL particles concentrations (999 nmol/l, p < 0.001) and HDL size (0.2 nm, p < 0.001). ApoA-I, pro-ApoA-I, and HDL functionality remained unchanged. Triglyceride (-0.49 mmol/l, p < 0.001), ApoB100 (-0.68 g/l, p = 0.007), and particle concentrations of LVLDL (-2.2 nmol/l, p = 0.002), SLDL (-58 nmol/l, p = 0.024) and LDL (-86 nmol/l, p = 0.006) decreased. Cholesterol concentrations in VLDL (-0.15 mmol/l, p < 0.001), IDL (-0.11 mmol/l, p = 0.001) and small LDL C (-0.04 mmol/l, p < 0.001) decreased, while large LDL A cholesterol (0.07 mmol/l, p = 0.031) and LDL particle size (0.1 nm, p = 0.004) increased. CRP concentrations (0.95 mg/dl, p = 0.003) rose. CONCLUSIONS: Substituting sitting with standing and self-perceived light walking in free-living conditions, translates into lower CVD risk lipid and lipoprotein profiles in individuals who are overweight/obese.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) have difficulty walking, which may prompt a physical therapy (PT) referral. Psychosocial factors, including mood, pain, and social support, may affect patients' participation and overall success in meeting PT goals; however, this has yet to be examined in MS. This study aimed to explore the associations between walking-related PT goal attainment and psychosocial factors. METHODS: Participants (N = 41) were individuals with MS from a larger study who engaged in PT per usual care during a 2-year study window. They had at least 1 walking-related goal in their PT plan of care, which could be based on subjective (eg, Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12) or objective measurement (eg, 6-Minute Walk Test). Examined psychosocial factors included impact of pain and fatigue, depression and anxiety symptom severity, and social support. Group differences were examined using bivariate analyses. RESULTS: Participants who met all their walking-related PT goals had lower levels of pain impact (14.15 ± 5.22 vs 19.14 ± 5.29; P = .004; d = 0.95) and symptoms of depression (5.45 ± 3.53 vs 7.71 ± 3.51; P = .046; d = 0.64) and greater social support (median: 14.00 vs 12.00; P = .019 d = 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the potential links between psychosocial factors and the attainment of walking-related goals by individuals who have MS. Further evaluation into psychosocial impact on PT plans of care is needed to help guide targeted assessment and intervention approaches."

This study explored the effects of HRVB on self-efficacy, quality of life, depression, anxiety, and heart rate variability (HRV) indices under the Six-Minute Walking Test (6MWT) in patients with COPD. The study hypothesizes that HRVB can improve self-efficacy and quality of life, reduce depression and anxiety, and decrease HRV reactivity while enhancing HRV recovery during the 6MWT. A total of 53 patients with COPD were assigned to either an HRVB group (n = 26) or a control group (n = 27), both received standard medical care. The HRVB group also participated in one hour weekly for six weeks. All participants completed assessments using the COPD Self-Efficacy Scale, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Beck Anxiety Inventory pre-test and post-test. The 6MWT was administered to measure HRV during baseline, walking, and recovery stages. Significant improvements in self-efficacy and quality of life for the HRVB group, with a significant increase in post-test compared to pre-test and the control group. However, there were no significant differences in changes in depression and anxiety between the two groups. Additionally, the HRVB group exhibited a significant decrease in HRV reactivity and increased HRV recovery at the post-test compared to the pre-test. These findings indicated that HRVB effectively enhances self-efficacy and quality of life in patients with COPD while improving autonomic function. Therefore, HRVB could be a valuable component of pulmonary rehabilitation for patients with COPD."

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization states that physical activity has the potential to influence physical, mental, and social dimensions of health in a powerful way. However, in modern society, physical activity is increasingly becoming an active choice, rather than a part of everyday life. Schools have been identified as key settings for health promotion, but physical activity initiatives in schools have rarely had a sustained impact. Interventions have been criticized for seeking to increase levels of physical activity by focusing on individual behaviors rather than considering the contexts and social structures in which individuals live their lives. With a theoretical foundation in settings-based health promotion, this article proposes an alternative initiative for sustainable movement-based education called Walking School. Walking School defines sustainable movement as the movement that is an integral part of the school day and school culture. Walking School, or outdoor teaching while walking, has the potential to (i) be inclusive of both teachers and students, (ii) extend the classroom and make physical activity a collective responsibility of all teachers, not just physical education teachers, (iii) reduce sedentary time and increase physical activity without losing instructional time, (iv) stimulate physical activity and create conditions conducive to the development of new habits by using the outdoor environment as a teaching space, and (5) become part of the school's core business of education, and ultimately a part of the school culture.",

Peak ankle moment during walking may be used to predict the optimal stiffness. (1) Assess the effects of AFO stiffness on ankle moment, AFO-generated moment, and muscle-generated moment; (2) evaluate the accuracy of predicting optimal AFO stiffness using peak ankle moment during walking without AFO. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 18 individuals with neuromuscular disorders with reduced ankle moments during shoes-only walking. AFO stiffness was experimentally optimized to minimize energy cost. Using repeated measures ANOVA we evaluated the effects of AFO stiffness on ankle moment parameters. RESULTS: A quadratic relationship between AFO stiffness and net ankle moment (p < 0.001), a positive linear relationship with AFO-generated moment (p < 0.001), and a negative linear relationship with muscle-generated moment (p < 0.001) was found. The predicted optimal AFO stiffness, based on the difference between the healthy peak ankle moment (1.2 Nm/kg) and moment without AFO, differed on average 0.53 ± 0.46 Nm/degree (13.7%) from the experimentally optimized stiffness. CONCLUSIONS: Predicting AFO stiffness based on peak ankle moment during shoes-only walking is a promising method for determining optimal stiffness or guidance of experimental optimization."

Herein, a new COFs functionalized electrochemical biosensor has been developed to detect DNA adenine methylation (Dam) MTase activity with high sensitivity and rapidity by taking advantage of the DNA walker and rolled circular strand displacement amplification (RC-SDA) reaction. Specifically, hairpin probe H1 was methylated by Dam MTase, followed by methylation site-specific cleavage of DpnI enzyme to generate the S5 probe. The padlock probes with two nucleic acid endonuclease sites were introduced to trigger the RC-SDA reaction under the action of the primer, releasing a large number of single-stranded S6 probes. The released probe worked synergistically with the Exo III enzyme to trigger DNA walking, which exposed the binding sites to enable the Au-COF-MB signal probes to bind effectively to the electrode surface, and the electrochemical signals were thus generated. The result showed that the designed electrochemical biosensor demonstrated excellent sensitivity and specificity in detecting the activity of Dam MTase, with the detection limit (LOD) of 6.85 × 10-5 U/mL. This method provides support for the development of new treatment strategies for methylation related diseases.",

OBJECTIVE: Following UK Medical Research Council guidelines, this study assessed the implementation of the intervention, examined the mechanisms of impact, and identified contextual factors influencing engagement. METHODS: Adults (aged ≥18 y) with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer who reported not meeting the UK guidelines for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (≥150 min/wk) were recruited from a single hospital site in Yorkshire, United Kingdom. They were randomly assigned to the intervention or control (usual care) arm and assessed via quantitative surveys at baseline (time point 0 [T0]) and 3-month follow-up (time point 1 [T1]) and qualitative exit interviews (36/44, 82%) at T1. The process evaluation included intervention participants only (n=44). Implementation was assessed using data from the T1 questionnaire exploring the use of the intervention components. The perceived usefulness of the app, leaflet, and behavioral support call was rated from 0 to 5. Behavioral support calls were recorded, and the fidelity of delivery of 25 planned behavior change techniques was rated from 0 to 5 using an adapted Dreyfus scale. Mechanisms of impact were identified by examining T0 and T1 scores on the Self-Reported Behavioural Automaticity Index and feedback on the leaflet, app, call, and planner in the T1 questionnaire and qualitative interviews. Contextual factors influencing engagement were identified through qualitative interviews. RESULTS: The implementation of the intervention was successful: 98% (43/44) of the participants received a behavioral support call, 78% (32/41) reported reading the leaflet, 95% (39/41) reported downloading the app, and 83% (34/41) reported using the planners. The mean perceived usefulness of the app was 4.3 (SD 0.8) in participants still using the app at T1 (n=33). Participants rated the leaflet (mean 3.9, SD 0.6) and the behavioral support call (mean 4.1, SD 1) as useful. The intended behavior change techniques in the behavioral support calls were proficiently delivered (overall mean 4.2, SD 1.2). Mechanisms of impact included habit formation, behavioral monitoring, and support and reassurance from the intervention facilitator. Contextual factors impacting engagement included barriers, such as the impact of cancer and its treatment, and facilitators, such as social support. CONCLUSIONS: The APPROACH intervention was successfully implemented and shows promise for increasing brisk walking, potentially through promoting habit formation and enabling self-monitoring. Contextual factors will be important to consider when interpreting outcomes in the larger APPROACH randomized controlled trial.

      "abstract": "State mindfulness is a dynamic construct reflecting current mindfulness, or purposeful attention to the present moment with openness, non-judgment, non-reactivity, and acceptance. Despite its popularity and research in psychology and medicine, measuring state mindfulness remains a challenge. Validity and reliability of the State Mindfulness Scale (SMS) and State Mindfulness Scale for Physical Activity (SMS-PA) in applied settings like nature require more data to be established. This pilot study aimed to evaluate these scales and introduce a new, one-item scale, the Visual Analog Scale-Mindfulness (VAS-M), for quicker mindfulness assessment. Participants completed the SMS, SMS-PA, and VAS-M upon arrival at a desert trail, after 10 minutes of sitting, and after 10 minutes of walking. A subset repeated the intervention 24 hours later. The study found that the SMS and SMS-PA could be given before, during, and after nature immersion. The SMS-PA showed evidence of concurrent validity with the SMS (ρ = .89, p < .001). However, the VAS-M did not meet the criteria for concurrent validity with the other scales. None of the scales met the criteria for test-retest reliability. This study underscores the need to validate state mindfulness scales, especially in non-laboratory settings. While the SMS-PA shows promise, further validation and refinement of the VAS-M are needed. The findings enhance our understanding of measuring state mindfulness, particularly in natural environments. While the scales are already in use, our study helps address gaps in evidence and informs future decisions about their application."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Freezing of gait (FoG) is one of the most disabling symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD). Detecting and monitoring episodes of FoG are important in the medical follow-up of patients to assess disease progression and functional impact and to adjust treatment accordingly. Although several questionnaires exist, they lack objectivity. Using wearable sensors such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) to detect FoG episodes offers greater objectivity and accuracy. There is no consensus on the number and location of IMU, type of algorithm, and method of triggering and scoring the FoG episodes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the use of multiple wearable sensors sets to detect FoG in patients with PD during various walking tasks under different medication conditions. METHODS: This single-center, prospective cohort study (DetectFoG) will include 18 patients with PD. Patients will be fitted with 7 IMUs and will walk a freezing-provoking path under different tasks-\"single task,\" \"dual motor task,\" or \"dual cognitive task\"-and medical conditions corresponding to levodopa medication (\"on\" or \"off\"). Passages will be videotaped, and 2 movement disorder specialists will identify FoG episodes in the videos. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the most effective combination of wearable sensors for detecting FoG episodes will be studied. RESULTS: The study is currently in the data collection phase, having commenced recruitment in February 2024. Once all data have been gathered, the data analysis will commence. As of August 2024, 3 patients have been recruited. It is anticipated that the results will be published by the end of 2025. CONCLUSIONS: Detecting FoG episodes in various medical and clinical settings would provide a more comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon. Furthermore, it would enable reliable and objective monitoring of the progression of this symptom based on treatments and the natural course of the disease. This could serve as an objective tool for monitoring patients and assessing the severity and frequency of FoG.

This randomized controlled trial (RCT) examines the effects of a real-life cognitively enriched walking program on cognitive functioning and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in adults aged ≥65 years. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A three-arm RCT was conducted, comparing the cognitively enriched walking program (WALK+, doing cognitive tasks while walking) with a walking program without enrichment (WALK-only) and a passive control condition (CONT). Both WALK+ and WALK-only had a duration of six months, with two outdoors, supervised group-based sessions/week (60-90 minutes/session). Cognitive functioning (short- and long-term memory, executive functioning and processing speed) and MVPA were measured at baseline, three, six and 12 months using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers respectively. RESULTS: A total of 148 community-dwelling adults (median age: 69 years, range: 65-85; 72% (n=107) female) were included. Comparing WALK+ to WALK-only and CONT, and WALK-only to CONT, there were no significant intervention effects on cognitive functioning at three, six or 12 months. MVPA decreased with 13 minutes/day in WALK+ between baseline and 12 months, whilst it increased between baseline and six months with 12 minutes/day in WALK-only and between three and six months with 16 minutes/day in CONT. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The WALK+ program did not lead to statistically significant benefits for cognitive functioning or MVPA compared to WALK-only or CONT. Future studies should explore for whom combined interventions may work and determine the optimal dosage."

However, the specific causal relationships between these factors remain unclear. This study evaluated the effects of aging-related deficits in muscle properties on dynamic stability during walking. METHODS: Walking movements were simulated using two-dimensional musculoskeletal models consisting of 18 Hill-type muscles. To assess the effects of aging-related deficits in muscle function on dynamic stability during walking, five models with different muscle properties were created, namely young adult (YA) and older adult (OA) models, models with reduced maximum isometric muscle force, reduced maximum muscle contraction velocity, and prolonged muscle deactivation time (∆F, ∆V, and ∆T models, respectively). The margin of stability (MoS) was used as a measure of dynamic stability during walking. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The MoS value of the OA model was greater than that of the YA model, and the ∆F model yielded a larger MoS value than those of the ∆V and ∆T models. Therefore, the OA model achieved a more dynamically stable state than the YA model and the ∆F model required a more stable state to sustain continuous walking compared to the ∆V and ∆T models. These findings indicate that aging-related deficits in muscle function limit the control of dynamic stability during walking with the degeneration of maximum isometric muscle force being the most influential factor. These findings could aid in the development of an intervention program to reduce the risk of falls in older adults effectively."

Eighty-four participants were randomly assigned to either the forest or urban group, with 78 completing 90-min walks and analysis. The primary outcome measured was the change in saliva-secreted immunoglobulin A (sIgA) levels. Evaluating researchers were blinded to the groups, but participants and on-site staff were not. Here, we demonstrate a significant increase in saliva-secreted immunoglobulin A (sIgA) levels in the forest group. Furthermore, forest walking resulted in improved mood, including a reduction in stress hormone levels. In conclusion, mindful forest walking has the potential to enhance immunity and promote health.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) can experience intermittent claudication, which limits walking capacity and the ability to undertake daily activities. While exercise therapy is an established way to improve walking capacity in people with PAD, it is not feasible in all patients. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) provides a way to passively induce repeated muscle contractions and has been widely used as a therapy for chronic conditions that limit functional capacity. Preliminary trials in patients with PAD demonstrate that stimulation of the leg muscles using a footplate-NMES device can be performed without pain and may lead to significant gains in walking capacity. Studies, to date, have been small and have not been adequately controlled to account for any potential placebo effect. Therefore, the current trial will compare the effect of a 12-week programme of footplate-NMES with a placebo-control on walking capacity (6 min walking distance) and other secondary outcomes in patients with PAD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Foot-PAD trial is a double-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of a 12-week home-based programme of footplate NMES on walking capacity in people with PAD. This is a single-centre trial with numerous recruitment locations. A total of 180 participants with stable PAD and intermittent claudication will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive either footplate-NMES (intervention condition) or footplate-placebo (control condition) for two 30 min periods each day for 12 weeks. The footplate-NMES device will deliver stimulation sufficient to induce contraction of the leg muscles and repeated plantar and dorsiflexion at the ankles. The footplate-placebo device will deliver a momentary low-intensity transient stimulation that is insufficient to induce contraction of the leg muscles. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline (week 0), mid-intervention (week 6), postintervention (week 12) and 6 weeks after the completion of the intervention (week 18). The primary outcome is walking capacity at week 12, measured as maximum walking distance during the 6 min walk test. Secondary outcomes will include pain-free walking distance during the 6 min walk test; pain-free and maximum walking time during a graded treadmill walking test; disease-specific quality of life (Intermittent Claudication Questionnaire), self-reported walking impairment (Walking Impairment Questionnaire) and accelerometer-derived physical activity levels. Exploratory outcomes will include the Ankle-Brachial Index; leg vascular function; perception of device-use experience and symptom monitoring throughout the trial using the Claudication Symptom Instrument and a pain Visual Analogue Scale. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Foot-PAD trial has received ethics approval from the Human Research Ethics Committees of Queensland Health Metro North Hospital and Health Service (78962) and the University of the Sunshine Coast (A21659). Regardless of the study outcomes, the study findings will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and presented at scientific meetings. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12621001383853.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a prevalent vascular condition characterized by arterial narrowing, which impairs blood flow and manifests as intermittent claudication, a pain or cramping sensation induced by physical activity or ambulation. Walking distance is a crucial clinical indicator of peripheral artery disease, and it correlates with the disease severity and risk of mortality. It reflects the severity of the disease, with reduced mobility indicating an increased risk of morbidity. It can also inform on the efficacy of the treatment. Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, has been demonstrated to enhance walking distance in patients with peripheral artery disease through the dilation of blood vessels and the inhibition of platelet aggregation. With this preliminary study, we aimed to elucidate other possible effects of cilostazol, specifically its influence on the structural properties of red blood cells. Methods: 10 patients (5 men, 5 women) with PAD were treated with cilostazol over a three-month period. Its biochemical effects on RBCs were determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Patient's blood samples were collected at the start of treatment, then after two weeks, one month, two months, and three months of therapy. Results: The DSC analysis revealed shifts in thermal properties, including change in peak (melting or denaturation) temperature (Tp) and calorimetric enthalpy (ΔHcal), which indicate significant structural changes in red blood cells. These thermal property changes correlated with clinical improvements in walking distance reported by patients. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that cilostazol induces substantial biochemical modifications in red blood cells, enhancing their functional properties and contributing to improved clinical outcomes. This study highlights the potential of differential scanning calorimetry as an adjunctive method for assessing the effectiveness of treatments for peripheral artery disease at the cellular level. However, further investigation with larger patient cohorts is required to confirm these initial results."

Strength and muscle activation of main lower limb muscles were assessed. EI group exhibited a general strength increase after intervention (T2), (16.31-34.72 N), and maintained this improvement up to 1-month-follow-up (T3) for hip abduction and extension movements. The CI group only showed improvements in hip abduction and extension movements (18.34 (7.13) N and 19.98 (9.60) N, respectively). EI group also exhibited an increase of activation in all agonistic muscles in T2 (36.02-20.24 µV), except gastrocnemius. Gastrocnemius and rectus femoris activation as antagonistic decreased during dorsal flexion (- 14.28 (5.61) µV) and hip extension (- 14.78 [6.11] µV), respectively. CI group only showed an activation increase of agonistic muscles of hip abduction and extension (22.16 (9.80) µV and 28.82 (9.14) µV, respectively), without changes in antagonistic activation.

This study aimed to assess the association between preoperative nutritional status evaluated by the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and walking independence at one year postoperatively in patients who have ONFH undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from patients admitted to a tertiary referral hospital who had ONFH and underwent primary unilateral THA from October 30, 2014 to April 26, 2019. The restricted cubic spline was used to assess the dose-effect relationship between PNI and recovery of walking independence. Propensity score matching was performed to balance potential preoperative confounders, and multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis was applied to assess the association between malnutrition and losing walking independence (LWI) with perioperative and follow-up factors for further adjustment. Inverse probability treatment weighting and sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. Subgroup analyses were used to determine potential population heterogeneity. RESULTS: We found a negative relationship between admission PNI levels and recovery of walking independence at one year postoperatively, and that low PNI (< 42.2) was independently associated with a 2.35-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16 to 4.77; P = 0.018) increased risk of LWI. The results were overall robust. Considerable heterogeneities were observed in the subgroups of age, labor intensity, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, Charlson's comorbidity index, and Association Research Circulation Osseous stage (P for interaction < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative low-level PNI is a significant risk factor for LWI after THA in patients who have ONFH. This finding supports nutritional screening and interventions for surgeons in decision-making for elective surgery and postoperative rehabilitation management."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of practicing the health Qigong-Baduanjin exercise on lower limb balance among elderly individuals. METHODS: Two intervention methods, Baduanjin and brisk walking, were applied to study the effect of exercise on senior balancing. Sixty elderly individuals aged 65 to 79 were selected and randomly divided into the Baduanjin group, the brisk walking group, and the control group that did not engage in exercise. There were a total of 20 individuals in each group, 10 males and 10 females. The first two groups participated in a 16-week exercise regimen. The balance tests for members of all three groups were conducted. RESULTS: (1) For the eyes-open two-legged standing posture, the center of pressure (COP) was more centralized in the Baduanjin group; the swaying range of the body, forward and backward displacement, and left and right displacement among the elderly individuals in this group were significantly lower than those of the other two groups. (2) In the tests for two-legged standing, one-legged standing, and tandem feet stance, the elderly in the Baduanjin group had significantly lower swaying trajectory of the center of gravity, body swaying ellipse area, and maximum vibration parameters than those in the brisk walking and control groups. (3) The 2nd pose of Baduanjin, which involves a considerable amount of knee bending and semi-squatting exercises for the lower limbs, proved to be beneficial for the lower limb joints and body balance among the elderly. CONCLUSION: Long-term practice of health Qigong-Baduanjin can exert a beneficial impact on improving the muscle strength of the lower limb joints and ankle joint flexibility, improving the static balance ability of the elderly, and consequently reducing their risk of falling.",

The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate whether aquatic exercise for children with CP improves their walking ability and quality of life (QOL) and is enjoyable for them. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on 2 August 2024 using three databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews. Studies included in the review focused on aquatic exercise interventions for children with CP, with outcomes related to walking ability, QOL, or enjoyment. Studies that did not isolate the effects of aquatic exercise (except when combined with conventional interventions) were excluded. Two reviewers independently conducted screening and risk of bias assessments. RESULTS: Seven studies involving 94 participants in total were included in the review. Three of these studies had a control group. All four studies reported improvements in walking ability, including walking endurance and efficiency. One of two studies showed improvement in health-related QOL (HRQOL) compared to the control group, whereas the other did not show significant differences between groups. All three studies that assessed enjoyment reported high levels of enjoyment of aquatic exercise. However, all studies were at risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: The reviewed studies suggest that aquatic exercise for children with CP may be enjoyable and may improve walking ability. Further research is needed to accurately assess the effects of aquatic exercise and compare it to other interventions."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the kinematic changes in the knee joint during walking in patients with isolated PCL-deficiency (PCLD) to determine the presence of walking-related joint instability (mechanical instability-abnormal displacement form structural damage). Additionally, the study seeks to provide biomechanical insights into the observed differences between subjective and objective assessments. METHODS: 35 healthy volunteers and 27 patients with isolated PCLD (both involved and uninvolved sides) were included in the study. All participants walked on a treadmill at a self-selected comfortable speed. An optical 3D motion capture system was employed to collect six degrees of freedom kinematic data of the knee joint during walking. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) was employed, using independent and paired t-tests to evaluate differences between the healthy control group and the PCLD group, as well as between the involved and uninvolved sides, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with the healthy control group, posterior tibial displacement (the main indicator for anterior-posterior instability) of the involved limb was significantly decreased during 79%-94%. additionally, knee flexion angles of the involved limb were significantly increased compared with healthy control group during 0%-5% and 95%-99% of the gait cycle and significantly decreased during 66%-87%; In the uninvolved side, adaptive gait changes were observed, with knee flexion angles significantly reduced during 20%-50% and 64%-89% of the gait cycle and posterior tibial displacement significantly reduced during 60%-94% compared with the healthy control group; Compared to the uninvolved limb, the involved limb showed increased internal rotation during 62%-71% of the gait cycle and increased knee flexion during 8%-53%, with no significant differences in other dimensions. CONCLUSION: From a biomechanical perspective, patients with PCL rupture exhibit no joint instability during walking. Compared to the healthy control group, the involved leg shows a significant reduction in posterior tibial displacement and a diminished range of knee flexion. Clinical evaluations of PCLD should incorporate dynamic functional assessments, thereby providing a more comprehensive basis for treatment decisions."

The method has been demonstrated to correlate well with the sequential correction of deformity for children under age 1 year. We conducted a study to examine the interobserver reliability of Pirani scores in children of walking-age. The retrospective study focused on children >1 year age with idiopathic clubfoot presenting for primary treatment. The Pirani scores at presentation charted by pediatric orthopedic consultant and orthopedic registrars were compared and the intergroup reliability calculated using Cohen's kappa. Thirty-five feet in 22 clubfoot children (13 bilateral) were analyzed. The mean child's age was 3.9 years. The mean Pirani score for the consultant was 3.2 and for the registrars was 3.6. The overall reliability of Pirani score was 0.3 ('fair'). The highest reliability was calculated for the head of talus (0.55), rigid equinus (0.48), and lateral border (0.44) (moderate). A lower kappa was recorded for medial crease (0.28), posterior crease (0.34), and empty heel (0.4). The registrars graded the clubfoot deformity in the walking-age child as more severe compared to the consultant. The mean Pirani scores for medial and posterior crease subcomponents were low. Contrary to the common perception, empty heel manifested even in this age group. Looking to the statistics of 'fair' reliability of Pirani score for older child, further research is warranted to develop more reliable scores for assessment and treatment of clubfoot."

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of Condoliase chemonucleolysis (CC) in patients who were nonambulatory because of severe leg pain. A total of 58 patients who underwent CC for conservative treatment-resistant LDH were included in this study. Changes in the leg and lower back pain evaluated using the numeric rating scale (NRS) were retrospectively assessed at three time points (1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after treatment). Patients were divided into the ambulatory group (group A) and nonambulatory group (group N) based on their ambulatory status. The clinical and radiological findings including magnetic resonance images were compared between the two groups. Of the 58 patients, 16 (28%) who could not walk independently because of severe leg pain were included in group N. Group N showed significantly higher mean NRS score for leg pain (NRS-LP) before treatment than group A (group N, 7.9; group A, 6.8; p = 0.009). Changes in the mean NRS-LP from pretreatment to 1 week were significantly higher in group N (group N, 5.2; group A, 3.4; p = 0.02). In group N, the mean NRS-LP decreased significantly over time, and 69% of the patients were ambulatory after 1 week, 88% after 1 month, and 94% after 3 months. CC provides early pain relief and can be an immediate treatment option for patients who cannot walk independently because of severe leg pain.",

The purpose of the present study was to explore the risk factors associated with reoperations following procedures under anesthesia (\"operations\") for DDH in patients between the ages of 1 and 3.00 years, with the goal of deriving treatment recommendations. METHODS: This retrospective birth cohort study included children who had undergone closed reduction, open reduction, or osteotomy for the treatment of unilateral DDH between the ages of 1 and 3.00 years, identified using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The children were followed until 10 years of age for reoperations, excluding implant removal and sequential closed reduction within 3 months postoperatively. A comparison between patients with and without reoperations was conducted, and binary logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with reoperation. Patients were further stratified by age and procedure for developing treatment recommendations. RESULTS: Among 2,261,455 live births from 2000 to 2009, 701 patients underwent operations for unilateral DDH between 1 and 3.00 years of age (an incidence of 31.0 per 1,000 live births). The initial operations included closed reduction (n = 86; mean age, 1.34 years), open reduction (n = 73; mean age, 1.53 years), pelvic osteotomy (n = 405; mean age, 1.59 years), femoral osteotomy (n = 93; mean age, 1.76 years), and pelvic osteotomy plus femoral osteotomy (n = 44; mean age, 1.84 years). Reoperations were performed in 91 patients (13%) at a mean age of 3.80 years. Comparison between patients with and without reoperations revealed the operative procedure as a significant factor. Logistic regression revealed that closed reduction was associated with a 1.8 to 9.0 times higher reoperation risk than open reduction, depending on age, whereas pelvic osteotomy was associated with 0.34 times the risk of reoperation than open reduction in patients 1.5 to 2.0 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Reoperations may not be directly linked to radiographic and functional outcomes but are important from the patient's perspective and in terms of cost-effectiveness. To reduce the risk of reoperation, the findings of the present study support open reduction to properly reduce the hip joint at walking age and additional pelvic osteotomy for patients beyond 1.5 years of age.

Approximately 73% of stroke survivors experience limited walking ability, requiring a gait aid or assistance. Physical activity is important for secondary stroke prevention, in addition to its benefits for physical and mental health. Little is known about the barriers and facilitators to physical activity in stroke survivors with limited walking ability. METHODS: This qualitative study used inductive thematic analysis of structured interviews to explore the barriers and facilitators to physical activity in stroke survivors with limited walking ability. RESULTS: Perceived barriers to physical activity included scarcity of services, societal views, changes in ability, and inclement weather. Perceived facilitators included the desired benefits of physical activity, multidisciplinary rehabilitation services, durable medical equipment, encouragement, positive mindset, and self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Improving access to rehabilitation services in the chronic phase of stroke and increasing the availability of structured exercise programmes are important strategies to address barriers to physical activity in this population. Supporting self-efficacy, addressing disability stigma, and policy changes are also needed to facilitate participation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Calf muscle weakness is a common symptom in slowly progressive neuromuscular disorders that lead to walking problems like instability and increased walking effort. The mainstay of treatment to improve walking in this population is the provision of ankle-foot-orthoses (AFOs). Since we are not aware of an up-to-date and complete overview of the effects of AFOs used for calf muscle weakness in slowly progressive neuromuscular disorders, we reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of AFOs to improve walking in this patient group, in order to support clinical decision-making. OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence for the effects of ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) for improving walking in adults with calf muscle weakness due to slowly progressive neuromuscular disorders. SEARCH METHODS: On 10 February 2023, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP. SELECTION CRITERIA: We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including randomised cross-over studies and quasi-RCTs, and non-randomised studies (NRSs) that examined the effects of AFO interventions compared with shoes-only walking in adults with calf muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disorders. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the methodological procedures described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We summarised findings for the primary outcome (objectively measured walking effort, assessed as walking energy cost) and secondary outcomes (perceived walking effort, physical mobility, gait parameters, AFO use, satisfaction with the AFO, and adverse events). We grouped results according to the type of AFO material and synthesised them in meta-analysis where possible. We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included four randomised cross-over studies and six NRSs with 186 participants in total (the smallest study had 8 participants and the largest had 37). All studies were designed as self-controlled studies and examined the effects of custom-made and/or prefabricated AFOs. The AFOs were made of carbon (5 studies), polypropylene (5 studies), silicone (1 study), metal (1 study), elastic materials (2 studies), or leather combined with other materials (1 study). Outcome measures with AFOs were assessed during a single session (in some studies, people already used the study AFO in daily life), when the AFO was delivered, or at three-week or three-month follow-up. We judged one study to be at moderate risk of bias, and nine studies to be at high or serious risk of bias, primarily due to bias arising from period and carryover effects, selection bias, the inability to blind participants and assessors, missing data, and selective reporting. We found that carbon AFOs may reduce walking energy cost (mean difference (MD) -0.86 J/kg/m, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.33 to -0.39; 2 studies, 45 participants; low-certainty evidence), and may increase walking speed (MD 0.19 m/s, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.27; 4 studies, 71 participants; low-certainty evidence) compared to shoes-only walking. We found that leather AFOs may increase walking speed (MD 0.25 m/s, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.43; 1 study, 11 participants; low-certainty evidence). Little or no effect on walking speed was found with polypropylene AFOs (MD 0.00 m/s, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.11; 2 studies, 25 participants; low-certainty evidence) and elastic AFOs (MD 0.03 m/s, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.18; 1 study, 14 participants; low-certainty evidence). Carbon AFOs may also enhance satisfaction while walking (1 study, 16 participants; low-certainty evidence). We were unable to draw conclusions about perceived walking effort (one study, 8 participants), balance (two studies, 21 participants), and AFO use (two studies, 51 participants), as the evidence is very uncertain. Finally, two studies (45 participants) reported on adverse events (low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence for ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) to improve walking in adults with calf muscle weakness comes from a limited number of small studies with heterogeneity in intervention characteristics and outcome assessment, and is of low to very low certainty. The evidence suggests that carbon AFOs may reduce walking energy cost (effort), increase walking speed, and enhance satisfaction, and leather AFOs may increase walking speed, while polypropylene and elastic AFOs may make little or no difference to walking speed. We are unable to draw conclusions about the effects of AFOs on perceived walking effort, balance, and use. Nor can we draw conclusions about adverse effects of using AFOs. The variety in the findings for AFOs made of different materials suggests further investigation is warranted to explore how different AFO materials impact walking improvement in people with calf muscle weakness due to slowly progressive neuromuscular disorders.",

Although physical activity, such as walking and bone joint exercise, is known to help maintain bone health, its effectiveness needs further examination. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of physical activity, in particular walking and bone joint exercise, on enhancing bone remodeling in menopausal women. A randomized controlled trial was conducted among menopausal women and allocated into three groups: walking, bone joint exercise, and control groups. The intervention was provided for eight weeks, with the outcomes measured before and after the intervention. The study assessed five bone remodeling biomarkers: estrogen, parathyroid hormone (PTH), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-β ligand (RANKL), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and bone mineral density (BMD). The paired sample student t-test and ANOVA were used to assess the effects of the interventions. The results indicated that, compared to pre-intervention, both walking and bone joint exercise significantly increased the estrogen (p = 0.026 and p = 0.023, respectively), decreased RANKL (p = 0.019 and p = 0.002, respectively), decreased PTH levels (p = 0.022 and p = 0.048, respectively) and increased the BMD scores (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). In the control group, none of the remodeling biomarkers significantly changed except the mean level of TNF-α, which was increased significantly (p = 0.001). This study highlights that structured exercise, such as walking and bone joint exercise, can significantly enhance bone remodeling markers in menopausal women. Therefore, implementing such physical activities into management may provide benefits to menopausal women.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many adults with intellectual disabilities live a sedentary lifestyle, have low levels of functional fitness and are overweight. The purpose of this study was to determine whether an exercise intervention with activities which are simple, fun, accessible and adapted for socialising in a group would elicit significant improvements in various parameters associated with functional fitness for adults with intellectual disabilities. METHODS: Forty-two adults with intellectual disability (44.5 ± 11.5 years) were randomly located to an exercise group (n = 19) and a control group (n = 23). The program consisted of walking, dancing, and resistance training exercises and was implemented, three times a week for 6 weeks. RESULTS: Significant ameliorations (p < 0.05) were reported for body mass, hip circumference, aerobic capacity, functional ability, muscular strength, balance, and flexibility with varying degrees of effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: The combined exercise training program showed a significant positive impact on various parameters associated with functional fitness for adults with intellectual disability.",
