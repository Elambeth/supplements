      "abstract": "BackgroundThe skin serves as a critical barrier, safeguarding the body against external threats including bacteria, viruses, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Compromised skin integrity can result in pain, hinder daily activities, and elevate the risk of infections. Clinically, dressings are the conventional treatment for skin injuries. However, these often necessitate frequent replacements and may exacerbate wound trauma during removal. Therefore, there is growing interest in developing innovative dressings such as hydrogels, which are celebrated for their softness, adaptability, permeability, and capacity to sustain a moist wound environment. Guar gum, a galactomannan polysaccharide extensively utilized in the food and biomedical sectors, forms highly viscous, biocompatible hydrogels that are promising for medical applications including capsules and wound dressings. Nonetheless, the mechanical strength and antimicrobial properties of guar gum hydrogels require enhancements for optimal medical efficacy.ObjectiveThis study explores the fortification of guar gum (GG) hydrogels with tannic acid (TA) and citric acid (CA), which are known for their antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, to develop injectable, antimicrobial hydrogel dressings.MethodsEmploying a one-pot synthesis method, this research aimed to create dressings for treating skin injuries in murine models. The hydrogels were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), assessed for antibacterial efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus, and evaluated for biocompatibility and therapeutic effectiveness in mice with full-thickness skin injuries.ResultsThe results demonstrated successful cross-linking, structural stability, and significant enhancement in wound healing, indicating the potential of these GG-CA-TA hydrogel dressings to broaden the scope of guar gum applications in clinical skin restoration.ConclusionIn this study, a kind of Guar gum hydrogel was successfully synthesized by one-pot method, which has great potential in clinical skin repair."

      "abstract": "The current challenge in developing wound healing dressings lies in achieving antibacterial effects while avoiding cytotoxicity to cells that are crucial for the healing process. Addressing this challenge, Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-67 (ZIF-67), a cobalt-containing metal-organic framework (MOF), has emerged as a promising additive due to cobalt's broad-spectrum antimicrobial effects. This study developed semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN) hydrogels by incorporating 1-3 wt.% ZIF-67 into collagen-guar gum matrices, resulting in biocomposites with tunable structural and functional properties. These biocomposites exhibit a fibrillar-granular morphology, uniform cobalt ion distribution on a semi-crystalline surface, and strong antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli). At 3 wt.%, ZIF-67 accelerates gelation, strengthens crosslinking interactions, and enhances the storage modulus, thermal stability, and hydrolytic resistance of the hydrogels. Furthermore, biocomposites with 1 wt.% ZIF-67 also function as in-situ curcumin delivery systems, offering controlled release under physiological conditions and significant biodegradation in the presence of collagenase. In vitro tests demonstrate that the chemical composition of these hydrogels, regardless of ZIF-67 content, effectively supports monocyte and fibroblast metabolic activity, promotes cell proliferation, and increases interleukin-10 (IL-10) secretion by human monocytes. Additionally, the absence of hemolytic effects in human blood further underscores the safety and suitability of these hydrogel biocomposites for advanced wound treatment applications."

      "abstract": "Argon cold plasma (ACP) treatment is an eco-friendly approach to modify guar gum (GG), a plant-derived polysaccharide with significant food industry applications. This study investigated the impact of ACP treatment (10 W, 2-8 min) on GG's structural, physicochemical, and functional properties. ACP treatment decreased the molecular weight (Mw) with increased treatment time, from 2.82 × 105 (GG) to 1.64 × 105 Da, after 8 min, attributed to reactive plasma species cleaving glycosidic bonds. The mannose/galactose (M/G) ratio peaked at 2.55 after 4 min, attributed to main-chain degradation, but decreased with prolonged treatment, resulting from side-chain disruption. Structural analyses confirmed the preservation of GG's core chemical structure, and revealed increased surface roughness, increased porosity, and reduced aggregation. Thermal stability improved and solubility increased, which correlate with a lower average Mw and enhanced hydrogen bonding. Rheological tests showed shear-thinning behavior and reduced apparent viscosity, consistent with molecular chain depolymerization. Notably, ACP-treated GG had enhanced emulsifying capacity and stability in soy protein isolate (SPI) emulsions, attributed to improved interfacial adsorption and a narrower oil droplet distribution. These findings demonstrate that ACP treatment effectively modifies the physicochemical properties of GG, thereby positioning it as a promising functional enhancer for food emulsification."

      "abstract": "To enhance coal utilization efficiency and improve the dewatering performance of flocculants, the hydrophobic cationic monomer benzyl (methacryloyloxyethyl) dimethylammonium chloride and guar gum was utilized to synthesize a guar gum grafted polymethacryloyloxyethyl benzyl ammonium chloride flocculants (GG-g-BMDAC), and the polymerization conditions were optimized: GG concentration of 1.5 %, BMDAC/GG ratio of 1:10, photoinitiator concentration of 0.3 %, irradiation time of 90 min, weakly acidic pH, and urea addition when the viscosity of the system is too high. Comprehensive characterization of the GG-g-BMDAC flocculant was conducted through various analytical techniques including FTIR, XPS, NMR, XRD, SEM, and TG-DSC. Flocculation-dewatering tests demonstrated that GG-g-BMDAC significantly enhanced the clarity and dewatering speed of coal mine wastewater, and the optimal dosage of GG-g-BMDAC was 1.2 mg/g(s): sedimentation speed reached 2.58 cm/min, transmittance is 81.10 %, deposit thickness is 10.80 cm, dewatering speed is 138.74 cm/h, filter cake moisture is 36.25 %, and average mass specific resistance is 11.26 m/kg·1011. Zeta potential measurements, adsorption analysis, and wettability testing indicated that GG-g-BMDAC exhibited strong charge neutralization, bridging effects, and hydrophobic interactions. This study provides valuable insights for preparing the environment friendly flocculant with high dewatering efficiency in industrial wastewater treatment applications."

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of adding guar gum (GG) and fish collagen peptide (FCP) during rice cooking on postprandial blood glucose and satiety of rice and the related mechanisms. The results showed that the combined intervention of GG and FCP (GG-FCP) significantly reduced the postprandial blood glucose levels. The GG increased the viscosity of the digesta, and the physical barrier of GG and FCP formed on the surface of the rice limited the disintegration of the rice granule. The chyme containing GG and FCP displayed a larger particle size and gastric emptying were delayed. GG-FCP alleviated the digestion rate of rice, with the rapidly digestible starch content decreasing from 77.68 % to 65.01 %. Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) analysis indicated the GG and FCP reduced the binding water content of starch. DSC analysis showed that the addition of GG and FCP reduced the enthalpy of gelatinization of rice flour from 5.87 to 3.13 J/g, and the gelatinization degree of the rice flour was reduced. This study investigated the mechanisms of exogenous additives in regulating rice digestion and postprandial response. The findings would provide evidence-based strategies for developing rice products with the potential to mitigate the effects of blood glucose."

      "abstract": "In this study, a novel dust suppressant (CMGG-AM) was synthesized by grafting acrylamide (AM) onto carboxymethyl guar gum. The synthesis process was optimized to determine the ideal conditions for the grafting reaction, and the optimal reaction conditions of the CMGG-AM were 2 g of carboxymethyl guar gum, 0.06 g of N, N'-Methylenebisacrylamide, 6 g of AM, and 0.2 g of potassium persulfate at 60 °C. The dust suppressant was characterized using XRD, TG-DTG, and FTIR analyses. CMGG-AM exhibited significantly superior resistance to wind erosion and water retention compared to conventional treatments. Following treatment with CMGG-AM, the sample demonstrated a 90 % dust suppression rate at a wind speed of 15 m/s and a 15 % moisture content after evaporation at 40 °C for 10 h. Particle size analysis and SEM imaging revealed that CMGG-AM facilitated the aggregation of dust particles and formed a robust protective film on the dust surface. Additionally, adsorption experiments and molecular dynamics simulations were meticulously designed to investigate the binding of CMGG-AM to soil dust. Adsorption experiments elucidated a single-layer physical adsorption mechanism, predominantly governed by hydrogen bonding forces. Molecular dynamics simulations further illustrated the spontaneity of the adsorption and the characterization of hydrogen bonds as the main driving force. These findings not only validate the practical applicability of CMGG-AM as an eco-friendly dust suppressant but also pave the way for future advancements in the sustainable management of soil dust pollution."

      "abstract": "Traditional wound care methods are less effective for infectious and diabetic wounds, highlighting an urgent need for effective strategies. The study aimed to design a self-healing hydrogel with antibacterial, antioxidant, and photothermal capabilities to treat infectious and diabetic wounds. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were loaded into mesoporous polydopamine (MPDA) nanoparticles to form Ag@MPDA nanoparticles. Ag@MPDA was incorporated into the cationic guar gum-chitosan-boric acid (CCB) hydrogel to obtain the PA-CCB hydrogel. PA-CCB hydrogel exhibited excellent self-healing and adhesive properties, adapting well to the dynamic wound environment. PA-CCB hydrogel combined with photothermal therapy (PTT) could effectively eradicated E. coli (99.9 %) and S. aureus (99.7 %). The PA-CCB hydrogel reduced excessive reactive oxygen species and promoted the migration of fibroblasts in vitro. In the infected mouse wound models, the PA-CCB hydrogel effectively inhibited bacteria. After combining with PTT, the antibacterial ability of the PA-CCB hydrogel was further enhanced. In the diabetic mouse wound models, the PA-CCB hydrogel reduced the inflammatory level of wound tissue. In both models, after combining with PTT, the PA-CCB hydrogel exhibited further improvements in angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and re-epithelialization. By integrating multifunctional hydrogel with PTT, the PA-CCB hydrogel exhibited broad application potential for infectious and diabetic wounds.",

      "abstract": "This study outlines the sustainable synthesis of hybrid biopolymer hydrogels supported with octahedral Cu2O nanoparticles (NPs), alongside their biological assessments and characterizations. A composite hydrogel made of chitosan and guar gum (CS-GG) was employed as a template for the environmentally friendly synthesis of nanoparticles. Leveraging their electron-rich functional groups, the biopolymers acted as stabilizing agents for the Cu2O NPs and as green reductants, facilitating the reduction of copper ions. The material's physicochemical properties were thoroughly examined using advanced techniques, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopes (FE-SEM), Eneregy Dispersive X-ray Electron Spectroscopy (EDX), Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and ICP-OES. The resulting CS-GG/Cu2O NPs nanocomposite was investigated as a reusable heterogeneous nanocatalyst, demonstrating its efficiency in the phosphine-free, palladium-free, and ligand-free synthesis of various stilbene derivatives with high yields through the Sonogashira coupling reaction. The catalyst showed no significant reduction in activity after being reused seven times consecutively. The cytotoxic effects of the CS-GG/Cu2O NPs nanocomposite on NCI-H661 lung cancer cells and normal cells (HUVEC) were assessed over 48 h using MTT assay. The cancer cell's viability decreased after exposure to the CS-GG/Cu2O NPs, with an IC50 value of 82 μg/mL. The CS-GG/Cu2O NPs nanocomposite controls the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) system, which in turn impacts apoptosis and cell proliferation in NCI-H661 cells, according to a detailed examination of the mTOR pathway. The pathway could act a role in the cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis induced by the CS-GG/Cu2O NPs nanocomposite. The CS-GG/Cu2O NPs nanocomposite could be a useful natural anti-cancer agent for the treatment of lung cancer.",

Healthy male and female subjects (n = 70; 9 male and 61 female; mean age: 45.5 ± 8.1 years) were recruited. They received either the 5 ‍g PHGG dietary fiber (n = 35) or a 5 ‍g placebo (n = 35) for twelve weeks. Skin moisture, TEWL, skin elasticity and skin color parameters, and related features were assessed at baseline, after 6 and 12 weeks, and questionnaires to evaluate the study outcomes. The results confirmed the improvement in skin conditions throughout the winter season by restoring skin hydration, reducing TEWL, and improving skin elasticity parameters. After 6 weeks of PHGG intake, there was a substantial decrease in TEWL and improvement in viscoelasticity metrics when compared to placebo. Subject satisfaction with efficacy reflected these encouraging findings, and PHGG was well tolerated, with no adverse events occurring during the study period."

Our study aimed to explore the effects of PHGG on gastrointestinal dysfunction in TBI mouse models. Controlled cortical impact (CCI)-induced TBI mouse models were administrated with PHGG (600 mg/kg/d) for 21 consecutive days. Behavioral tests (modified neurological severity score and beam walk test) and Y‑maze assay were performed to evaluate neurological functions and cognitive impairment. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blotting examined the levels of inflammatory cytokines, intestinal mucosal damage markers, intestinal tight junction proteins, and NLRP3 inflammasome-related molecules in the serum, cerebral cortex, and colon tissues. The histological changes in the cerebral cortex and colon tissues were observed through hematoxylin and eosin and Nissl staining. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analyzed SCFA amounts in the cecum contents and bile acid levels in the serum. PHGG administration alleviated neurological deficits and cognitive perturbations, reduced neuroinflammation, and attenuated cortical tissue damage and neuron loss in TBI mice. PHGG ameliorated intestinal barrier impairment, upregulated intestinal production of SCFAs, and elevated serum bile acid levels in TBI mice. Besides, PHGG treatment repressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation in TBI mice. Overexpressing NLRP3 reversed the beneficial effects of PHGG against TBI in mice. PHGG ameliorates neuroinflammation and gastrointestinal dysfunction in TBI murine models by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",

      "abstract": "Edible coating (EC) can reduce excessive oil absorption in deep-fat fried food products. Ultrasound is an efficient pretreatment to preserve the quality characteristics of fried samples. The impact of guar gum based EC and sonication on the quality parameters of fried zucchini slices was investigated. The frying time, moisture percent, oil absorption, texture hardness, surface area change, crust color parameters (lightness, redness, yellowness, and total color change), and sensory attributes were assessed after the frying process. EC with guar gum and ultrasonic pretreatment significantly increased the frying time of the slices (p < 0.05). Ultrasonic power (75 or 150 W) did not have a significant impact on changing the frying time and moisture content of fried zucchini pieces (p > 0.05). The guar gum based EC and sonication process reduces the oil absorption in samples by reducing water evaporation. The highest (17.87%) and lowest (12.19%) oil absorption were for the uncoated and coated-high-power-sonicated (150 W) fried zucchini slices, respectively. The high-power ultrasound pretreatment significantly decreased the hardness of fried zucchini pieces (p < 0.05). High-intensity ultrasonic pretreatment (150 W) significantly decreased the crust area change of fried zucchini slices (p < 0.05). The maximum lightness (82.54) and yellowness (41.25) indexes, the minimum redness (-7.24), and total color change (10.68) indexes were for the coated and high-power sonicated (150 W) slices. The highest appearance, odor, texture, flavor, and overall acceptance were for the coated and low-power sonicated (75 W) sample. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Ultrasound can induce various physicochemical effects, which can modify the structural properties of food products. Ultrasound (5 min, ultrasound bath 40 kHz and 75 W) with guar gum dispersion (1%, w/v) was an efficient treatment for maintaining the quality attributes of fried zucchini slices. The combined edible coating-sonication method can be used to reduce oil absorption, improve the physical properties of fried zucchini slices, and produce better quality product properties than traditional frying.",

      "abstract": "Managing wounds infected with multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria remains a significant public health challenge in clinical settings. While multifunctional hydrogels are commonly employed to treat skin infections, there is a scarcity of hydrogels that effectively combine cationic guar gum (CG) with both potent antimicrobial and safe therapeutic actions. This study introduces a novel pH responsive, dual-dynamically crosslinked hydrogel (CFC-PDA/Ag), synthesized by crosslinking CG with polydopamine (PDA)-coated silver nanozymes (PDA/PM-AgNPs). The formulated hydrogel demonstrates pH-sensitive peroxidase (POD)-like activity and notable photothermal conversion efficiency (58.39 ± 2.45 %). It exhibits optimal mechanical properties (elastic modulus, G': 0.99 kPa; viscous modulus, G\": 0.26 kPa), excellent injectability, self-healing within one minute, and efficient pH -responsive nanozyme release (82.64 % at pH 7.4 and 95.73 % at pH 6.4), enabling targeted bactericidal and anti-inflammatory effects. Extensive in vitro assessments confirm the hydrogel's robust photothermal properties (temperature range: 25-55 °C), outstanding antibacterial activity (kill rates of 99.12 ± 0.26 % against MRSA and 97.57 ± 1.22 % against E. coli), and effective free radical scavenging capabilities (DPPH: 91.25 ± 1.55 %, PTIO: 63.66 ± 8.32 %). In vivo studies on rat models with full-thickness MRSA-infected skin wounds demonstrated that CFC-PDA/Ag effectively eradicates MRSA, reduces inflammation, and enhances angiogenesis and collagen deposition, significantly accelerating the wound healing process. Collectively, these findings underscore the transformative potential of CFC-PDA/Ag hydrogel as an innovative therapeutic platform for treating wounds infected with MDR pathogens.",

The composition of the composite emulsion gels was determined in single-factor and orthogonal experiments. The results revealed that the optimal composite emulsion gels consisted of 6% peanut protein, 50% oil and 0.2% guar gum. After crushing pretreatment for 45 s, the printing deviation of the composite emulsion gels was reduced to 8.58 ± 0.20%. Moreover, after ultrasonic treatment (200 W for 20 min) of peanut proteins, the obtained composite emulsion gels presented the highest yield stress, hardness and G' values, as well as a denser and more homogeneous microstructure. After protein ultrasonic modification (200 W or 600 W for 20 min), the printing accuracy and self-supporting properties of the composite emulsion gels for printing complex shapes significantly improved, which was attributed to their stronger textural and rheological properties; however, ultrasonically modified peanut protein-guar gum composite emulsion gels were not suitable for printing products with smooth surfaces."

Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is a novel technique that utilizes the reactive species produced by high voltage discharge to modify food ingredients. In this study, guar gum was treated with CAP at different powers and duration, and its rheological properties, molecular structure, thermal stability, emulsifying activity, and stability were evaluated. CAP reduced the molecular weight of guar gum and altered its M/G ratio, leading to a decrease in the apparent viscosity of guar gum and an enhancement in its thermal stability and emulsifying function for soy protein isolate emulsions. Molecular structure analysis revealed the CAP treatment did not destroy the basic structure of guar gum, but caused alterations in the linkages between its glycosidic bonds and/or carbohydrate units. Scanning electron microscopy showed guar gum changed from a dense surface structure to a porous and loose structure after CAP treatment. Therefore, CAP effectively modifies guar gum, enhancing its potential in food and other industries.",

FTIR spectroscopy was applied to confirm the chemical transformation of GG into the hydrogel formulations while the 1HNMR was employed to confirm the successful preparation of CMGG. TGA, XRD, and AFM were used to compare the improved formulation to native and CMGG. The investigated hydrogels were then applied comparatively to remove methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) dyes from aqueous solution under various operating parameters. In addition, the AFM was used comprehensively to address the adsorption process by comparing the surface topographies, height and roughness measurements between the dry and dye-loaded hydrogel. Four adsorption isotherms were investigated in order to go deep through the adsorption mechanism. These are Langmuir Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson and Jovanovich isotherms. Based on the values of R2 for all the models, it can be assumed that the Langmuir model is best appropriate for the adsorption process and that the dyes were adsorbed onto a homogenous surface. Kinetic tests showed that the pseudo-second-order model best fitted the adsorption process, with R2 values of 0.9999 for both dyes, confirming chemisorption as the rate-limiting step. The thermodynamic data indicates spontaneous, exothermic adsorption processes, with Gibbs free energy changes (∆G) for MB ranging from -11.265 to -10.82 kJ/mol and MO from -3.221 to -3.323 kJ/mol. Negative enthalpy changes (∆H) of -17.892 kJ/mol for MB and - 17.005 for MO show the exothermic nature of adsorption. The data proved effective removal of MB and MO dyes onto CMGG/PAAc hydrogels with better affinity for MB dye, making them excellent wastewater treatment adsorbents.",

Methods: HG-CGG (2% w/v) was prepared by gum thickening and evaluated for pH, stability, spreadability, and viscosity. F-CGG was obtained using an aqueous dispersion of CGG (6% w/v) and the solvent casting method. F-CGG was characterized for thickness, weight uniformity, morphology, mechanical properties, hydrophilicity, and swelling potential. Both formulations were evaluated for bioadhesive potential on intact and injured porcine skin, as well as antioxidant activity. F-CGG was further studied for biocompatibility using hemolysis and cell viability assays (L929 fibroblasts), and its wound-healing potential by the scratch assay. Results: HG-CGG showed adequate viscosity and spreadability profiles for wound coverage, but its bioadhesive strength was reduced on injured skin. In contrast, F-CGG maintained consistent bioadhesive strength regardless of skin condition (6554.14 ± 540.57 dyne/cm2 on injured skin), presenting appropriate mechanical properties (flexible, transparent, thin, and resistant) and a high swelling capacity (2032 ± 211% after 6 h). F-CGG demonstrated superior antioxidant potential compared to HG-CGG (20.50 mg/mL ABTS+ radical scavenging activity), in addition to exhibiting low hemolytic potential and no cytotoxicity to fibroblasts. F-CGG promoted the proliferation of L929 cells in vitro, supporting wound healing. Conclusions: Therefore, CGG proved to be a promising material for developing formulations with properties suitable for cutaneous use. F-CGG combines bioadhesion, antioxidant activity, biocompatibility, cell proliferation, and potential wound healing, making it promising for advanced wound treatment."

Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) have garnered much importance in controlled drug delivery owing to their size. Chitosan (Cs) is a well-recognized biopolymer and Cs NPs have been widely explored in drug delivery. Nonetheless, reports pertaining to green synthesis of Cs NPs are scarce. Thus, in this study, green synthesis of Cs NPs was accomplished from raw mango peel extract. Spherical Cs NPs with positively charged surface of 33.4 mV was accomplished by this process. Cs NPs, in varied content, were integrated in a guar gum network matrix resulting in a nanocomposite hydrogel. The mechanical and thermal stability of the hydrogel improved upon addition of Cs NPs. The hydrogel exhibited smart swelling, good antioxidant and anti-inflammatory propensities. Cs NPs encapsulating 5-Fluorouracil demonstrated a controlled release drug profile in the colorectum and the kinetics implied the anomalous nature of drug release mechanism. The exposure of the drug-loaded nanocomposite hydrogel displayed improved anticancer effects in HT-29 colon cancer cells. Taken altogether, this study puts forth the greater efficacy of Cs NPs in controlled drug delivery for anticancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "Using biopolymers for soil stabilization is favorable compared to more conventional methods because they are more environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and long-lasting. This study analyzes the physical properties of guar gum and laterite soil mixes. A comprehensive engineering study of guar gum-treated soil was conducted with the help of a brief experimental program. This study examined the effects of soil-guar gum interactions on the strengthening behavior of guar gum-treated soil mixtures using a series of laboratory tests. The treated laterite soil's dry density increased marginally, while its optimum moisture content decreased as the guar gum increased. Treatment with guar gum significantly enhanced the strength of laterite soil mixtures. For laterite soil with 2% guar gum, the unsoaked CBR increased by 148% and the soaked CBR increased by 192.36%. The cohesiveness and internal friction angle increased by 93.33% and 31.52%, respectively. These results show that using guar gum dramatically improves the strength of laterite soil, offering a more environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative to traditional soil additives. Using guar gum in T8 subgrade soil requires a 1395 mm pavement depth and costs INR 3.83 crores, 1.52 times more than laterite soil. For T9 subgrade soil, the depth was 1495 mm, costing INR 4.42 crores, 1.72 times more than laterite soil. This study introduces a novel approach to soil stabilization by employing guar gum, a biopolymer, to enhance the physical and mechanical properties of laterite soil. Furthermore, this study provides a detailed cost-benefit analysis for pavement applications, revealing the financial feasibility of using guar gum despite it requiring a marginally higher initial investment."

The semi-crystalline nature of the synthesized beads was confirmed by FESEM analysis. The TGA studies implied that the beads were thermally stable up to 600 °C. The maximum swelling ratio of 1400 gg-1 was attained at pH 9.2 and 80 min. The evidence of a strong absorption band was found in FTIR spectrum at 584 cm-1 due to -P=S of the adsorbed pesticide CP. The maximum adsorption of CP was found to be 220.97 mgg-1. The adsorption followed pseudo second-order kinetics and Langmuir adsorption isotherm with regression coefficients 0.9998 and 0.9938 which followed the chemisorption process. It is due to the hydrolysis of CP at pH 9.2 to yield 3,5,6-trichloropyridinol which in turn reacts with the carboxylic group present in GG giving -N-C=O linkage. A -ΔG indicates that the process is spontaneous and involves chemisorption which is thermodynamically and kinetically favorable and a -ΔH value (-10.37 kJ/mol) suggests that the adsorption is exothermic.",

Cellulase biomolecules are efficiently immobilized on CGG/APAM/PDA hydrogels through the Schiff base reaction.

The treatment of bamboo fibers with immobilized cellulase results in a significant increase in flexibility, reaching 6.90 × 1014 N·m2, which is 7.18 times higher than that of untreated fibers. The immobilization of cellulases using CGG/APAM/PDA hydrogels as carriers results in a substantial enhancement of storage stability, pH applicability, and inter-fiber bonding strength, as well as the capacity to sustain high relative enzymatic activity at elevated temperatures.

Lignin, precipitated from the black liquor, was esterified using maleic anhydride as the esterifying reagent to enhance the hydrophobicity. Then, the composite aerogel fabricated from esterified lignin and guar gum (GG) was successfully prepared through the facile freeze-drying, using glutaraldehyde (GA) as the cross-linker. The resulting aerogel exhibited high porosity values exceeding 95%, low density (27.4 mg/cm3), and an impressive absorption capacity of 32.5 g/g for sunflower oil.

Starch with 25 % moisture content and combined with GG in a 9:1 ratio was selected for extrusion. Scanning electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry reveal that extrusion disrupts the ordered structure of starch and induces aggregation of starch granules, resulting in a more cohesive structure, and GG addition led to the further evolution of this structure into a more intricate and irregular form. Rheological assessments demonstrated a remarkable enhancement in the gelatinization characteristics of starch with GG addition, which led to elevated flow resistance and increased viscosity. On evaluating the in vitro digestive characteristics, we noted that adding GG to starch augmented the levels of slow-digestible starch and resistant starch. Consequently, this resulted in diminished digestibility and a lowered glycemic index. In summary, GG synergistically interacts with starch, forming intricately assimilable components. Moreover, the effects of extrusion vary across different starches, which proves advantageous for SPS and GG amalgamation, thereby enhancing their resistant components. Conversely, extrusion manifests contrasting outcomes for MS and PS.",

      "abstract": "Addressing the drawbacks of traditional flocculants on microalgae biomass harvesting is crucial for large-scale industrial applications of microalgae production. In this study, cationic bioflocculant was successfully prepared by introducing cationic groups into the side chain of guar gum, achieving in-situ algae flocculation efficiency of 83.5 % with the dosage of 18.0 mg/L under pH = 10.0. Through a harmonious integration of predictive modelling and practical experimentation, a superior cell flocculation capacity of 23.5 g/g was achieved. In addition, the environmental safety and biocompatibility of cationic guar gum was assessed, using the typical suspension quantitative bacteriostatic method and the fluorescent double-staining technique. The results showed that the inhibition efficiency of Staphylococcus aureus in the system containing 60.0 mg/L cationic guar gum was only 12.0 % and there was no inhibition against Escherichia coli colonies. These findings provide a safe and green flocculant for efficient microalgae harvesting and spent medium treatment.",

      "abstract": "Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) protects against intestinal barrier dysfunction and can ameliorate some intestinal diseases. However, whether PHGG has a role in protecting intestinal barrier function (IBF) during sepsis remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role and probable mechanism of PHGG in the intestinal mucosa in sepsis. A rat sepsis model was constructed using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). FITC-dextran 4 (FD-4) flux, serum inflammatory mediator levels, tight junction (TJ) levels, jejunum mucosa pathology, and epithelial intercellular junction ultrastructure were monitored to evaluate the effect of PHGG on IBF. Caco-2 monolayers were used to study the impact and mechanism of PHGG on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced barrier dysfunction in vitro. The expression of zonula occludens protein-1 and occludin and the location of P65 were studied by immunofluorescence. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and myosin light chain kinase 3 (MLCK) pathway-related protein expression was verified by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or western blotting. The results indicated that the jejunal mucosa structure was destroyed, the villi were disrupted and shortened, and neutrophil infiltration was evident in the septic rats. Compared to Sham group, spetic rats had increased Chiu's score, serum inflammatory mediator levels, and FD-4 flux but decreased TJ and gap junction density. In addition, the expression of MLCK, p-MLC, and TJ proteins and the expression of P65 in the nucleus were increased in septic rats. Furthermore, compared to those in the Control group, LPS-treated Caco-2 cells showed lower cell viability and transepithelial electrical resistance, while had higher FD-4 flux and the expression of MLCK, p-MLC, TJ proteins and P65 in the nucleus. PHGG pretreatment reversed the above effects induced by CLP or LPS treatment. Moreover, SN50, an NF-κB inhibitor, attenuated the above effects of LPS on Caco-2 cells. Overall, PHGG reduced inflammation, increased TJ protein expression and localization, and relieved damage to the TJ structure and intestinal permeability through suppression of the NF-κB/MLCK pathway. This study provides new insights into the role of PHGG in sepsis therapy.",

Besides, 30 % glycerol, 5 % calcium chloride, and 3 % ascorbic acid (w/w) were added to the coating solution as additives. The surface color, respiration rate, water vapor transmission rate, visible mold growth, and sensory analysis were assessed after seven days of storage. The inclusion of ascorbic acid and TEO in edible coating demonstrated a more effective delay in browning. The coated potatoes had lower OTR, CTR, and WVTR values for GG concentrations of 0.5 to 1 g/100 mL than the control. Compared to additives, higher concentrations of GG improved response parameters. The WVTR value of coated potatoes was significantly impacted by the interaction between CAEE and TEO with GG. Incorporating CAEE and TEO into the formulations of guar gum led to a reduction in the permeability of the coating to oxygen and water vapor. The seven days of extended shelf life compared to two days of control were observed with the optimized coating formulation. Furthermore, the application of the coating treatment proved effective in preventing enzymatic browning and creating a barrier against moisture and gases, contributing to prolonged freshness during extended storage periods.",

      "abstract": "Preventing bacterial infections is a crucial aspect of wound healing. There is an urgent need for multifunctional biomaterials without antibiotics to promote wound healing. In this study, we fabricated a guar gum (GG)-based nanocomposite hydrogel, termed GBTF, which exhibited photothermal antibacterial therapy for infected wound healing. The GBTF hydrogel formed a cross-linked network through dynamic borate/diol interactions between GG and borax, thereby exhibiting simultaneously self-healing, adaptable, and injectable properties. Additionally, tannic acid (TA)/Fe3+ nanocomplexes (NCs) were incorporated into the hydrogel to confer photothermal antibacterial properties. Under the irradiation of an 808 nm near-infrared laser, the TA/Fe3+ NCs in the hydrogel could rapidly generate heat, leading to the disruption of bacterial cell membranes and subsequent bacterial eradication. Furthermore, the hydrogels exhibited good cytocompatibility and hemocompatibility, making them a precandidate for preclinical and clinical applications. Finally, they could significantly promote bacteria-infected wound healing by reducing bacterial viability, accelerating collagen deposition, and promoting epithelial remodeling. Therefore, the multifunctional GBTF hydrogel, which was composed entirely of natural substances including guar gum, borax, and polyphenol/ferric ion NCs, showed great potential for regenerating infected skin wounds in clinical applications.",

It poses a challenge to utilize identical materials for the treatment of complex wastewater. Herein, in this research, multifunctional Ag NPs/guar gum hybrid hydrogels were fabricated using a facile in situ reduction and self-crosslinking method for efficient remediation of complex wastewater. The Ag NPs/guar gum hybrid hydrogel showed remarkable remodeling, adhesive, and self-healing characteristics, which was favorable for its versatile applications. The combination of Ag NPs with the guar gum skeleton endowed the hybrid hydrogel with exceptional catalytic activity for reducing aromatic compounds and dye pollutants, as well as remarkable antibacterial efficacy against pathogenic bacteria. In addition, the Ag NPs/guar gum hybrid hydrogel could be employed to coat a variety of substrates, including cotton fabrics and stainless steel meshes. The hydrogel coated cotton fabrics and meshes presented superhydrophilicity/underwater superoleophobicity, excellent antifouling capacity, and outstanding recyclability, which could be successfully applied for efficient separation of oil-water mixtures.

      "abstract": "With an increasing interest in dietary fibers (DFs) to promote intestinal health and the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, there is a continued rise in the incorporation of refined DFs in processed foods. It is still unclear how refined fibers, such as guar gum, affect the gut microbiota activity and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our study elucidated the effect and underlying mechanisms of guar gum, a fermentable DF (FDF) commonly present in a wide range of processed foods, on colitis development. We report that guar gum containing diet (GuD) increased the susceptibility to colonic inflammation. Specifically, GuD-fed group exhibited severe colitis upon dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) administration, as evidenced by reduced body weight, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and shortening of colon length compared to cellulose-fed control mice. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory markers in both serum [serum amyloid A (SAA), lipocalin 2 (Lcn2)] and colon (Lcn2) and extensive disruption of colonic architecture further affirmed that GuD-fed group exhibited more severe colitis than control group upon DSS intervention. Amelioration of colitis in GuD-fed group pre-treated with antibiotics suggest a vital role of intestinal microbiota in GuD-mediated exacerbation of intestinal inflammation. Gut microbiota composition and metabolite analysis in fecal and cecal contents, respectively, revealed that guar gum primarily enriches Actinobacteriota, specifically Bifidobacterium. Guar gum also altered multiple genera belonging to phyla Bacteroidota and Firmicutes. Such shift in gut microbiota composition favored luminal accumulation of intermediary metabolites succinate and lactate in the GuD-fed mice. Colonic IL-18 and tight junction markers were also decreased in the GuD-fed group. Importantly, GuD-fed mice pre-treated with recombinant IL-18 displayed attenuated colitis. Collectively, unfavorable changes in gut microbiota activity leading to luminal accumulation of lactate and succinate, reduced colonic IL-18, and compromised gut barrier function following guar gum feeding contributed to increased colitis susceptibility.",

      "abstract": "Treating chronic heart diseases in dogs is challenging due to variations in mass within and between species. Pimobendan (PBD), a veterinary drug only, is prescribed in specific cases of chronic heart disease in dogs and is available on the market in only a few different doses. Furthermore, the therapy itself is challenging due to the large size of the chewable tablets and the requirement for twice-daily administration. The development of customised and on-demand PBD medicines by three-dimensional (3D) printing has been proposed to circumvent these disadvantages. In this study, we designed controlled-release flavoured printlets containing PBD. We evaluated the use of two natural polymers, guar or xanthan gums, as the main component of the printing inks. Guar gum showed the better rheological behavior and printability by semisolid extrusion. The printlets were produced in three different shapes and sizes to allow dose customisation. Guar gum printlets showed a PBD controlled release profile, regardless of their shape or size. Therefore, we have demonstrated a novel approach for controlling PBD drug release and tailoring the dose by employing a natural polymer to produce 3D-printed tablets. This study represents a significant step towards the development of 3D-printed guar gum controlled-release formulations for veterinary applications.",

This study aims to enhance the characteristics of germinated highland barley starch (GBS) by exploring the synergistic effects of two alkalis (Na2CO3 and NaHCO3) and guar gum (GG) on GBS gel properties. The combined action of alkalis and GG significantly improved the peak viscosity, setback viscosity, and hardness compared with GG alone. The highest G' and G\" reached 998 and 204 Pa at 0.4% Na2CO3 addition, which were increased by nearly 44% and 50%, respectively. Fourier-transform infrared spectral analysis revealed that the alkalis strengthened interaction forces, particularly with intensified absorption peaks at 3200-3700 cm-1 and 1550-1750 cm-1. The Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 reduced the spin-spin relaxation time (T2), resulting in a dense starch gel network.

WPC (6 % w/v) and guar gum (0.25 % w/v) mixture was freeze dried after adjusting pH and treated at different pressure levels (0-600 MPa) for 0-30 min. The solubility of treated powders decreased significantly (p < 0.05) as treatment time and pressure levels increased. Thermal analysis showed an increase in denaturation temperature after HHP treatment at 600 MPa. A more crystalline structure was observed in samples treated with 600 MPa for 20 and 30 min. With increasing pressure and time, particle size of the samples increased and the highest particle size was belonged to sample treated at 600 MPa for 30 min (759.66 nm). SEM results exhibited that by applying the pressure, irregularity of shapes and particle size increased while the apparent cracks decreased. FTIR results indicated that HHP treatment changed shift in bond and peak intensity. As reported in the current study, the application of HHP treatment as a green physical technology on protein-polysaccharide mixture could be used to improve interaction of protein and polysaccharide."

The guar gum was considered as an extracellular cryoprotective substance. The present study evaluated the impact of the co-supplementation of guar gum with ethylene glycol or glycerol in the cryopreservation of bull sperm. Four ejaculates from 4 bulls were pooled and divided into ten groups consisting of 4 controls (glycerol 6%, ethylene glycol 6%, glycerol 3.5%, and ethylene glycol 3.5%, and six treatment groups including guar gum in 0.001% and 0.002% alone and or co-supplemented either with 3.5% glycerol or 3.5% ethylene glycol and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The sperm motility, viability, plasma membrane and DNA integrity, apoptotic-like changes, antioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities evaluated. The groups contained 3.5% glycerol + 0.001% guar gum, 3.5% ethylene glycol + 0.001% guar gum, and 0.001% guar gum alone showed higher values for live sperm, antioxidant enzymes, membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), fertilization, cleavage, and blastocyst rates; and lower values for apoptotic-like changes, H2O2 level, and DNA damage than the control groups. In conclusion, adding guar gum to the bull sperm diluent either alone or combined with glycerol or ethylene glycol ameliorated sperm viability and kinematic parameters and antioxidant capacity while reducing DNA damage and apoptotic-like changes. Guar gum also has improved embryo development. Due to its cost-effectiveness and physicochemical properties, guar gum is a promising supplement for bull sperm cryopreservation.",

      "abstract": "A highly efficient, bio-ecofriendly, and transparent flame retardant (FR) for cotton fabric was developed and deposited onto the cellulose skeletal structure of cotton fabric through a one-pot sol-gel process. The flame retardant functional coating is composed of ammonium polyphosphate (APP), guar gum (GG), citric acid (CA), and a negligible amount of catalyst. Cotton fabrics were impregnated with different concentrations of ammonium polyphosphate and guar gum, with citric acid as a crosslinking agent. The overall crosslinking and grafting process was proven by FTIR and XPS. Based on the results, the designed coating exhibits over 90 % transmittance in the visible region. A 15 g/m2 flame-retardant coating induces excellent flame retardant efficiency at ultra-low flame-retardant concentrations of less than 6.25 wt%. Only a 5.25 wt% flame retardant concentration demonstrated condensed phase action, which resulted in 58.5 % and 73.6 % reductions in the pHRR and THR, respectively. Moreover, the limiting oxygen index (LOI) value showed a 74 % increase. The mechanical performance of FR coated cotton fibers was slightly reduced.",

The postharvest characteristics such as weight loss, firmness, acidity, total soluble solids (TSS) and reducing sugar of control and treated fruits were evaluated at 5 days intervals throughout the storage period. The obtained results indicated that the application of guar gum/chitosan-based composite edible coating with coconut oil, clove bud and cinnamon bark essential oil was effective in prolonging the postharvest shelf life of Khasi mandarins as compared to control fruits by minimizing the decay and loss of postharvest quality attributes. The treatment of composite such as guar gum/chitosan/coconut oil/clove oil/cinnamon oil (GGCsC-Cl-Cn) was most effective in maintaining postharvest characteristics of fruits compared to other treatments and control. The significant (p < 0.05) lowest weight loss (38 %) with retention of higher firmness (5.9 N), titratable acidity (0.29 %), and total soluble solid (10.8 %) was noticed in the Khasi mandarins treated with GGCsC-Cl-Cn composite coating on 20 days of storage. Furthermore, the present study confirmed the significance of the developed composite formulation in improving the shelf life of Khasi mandarin.",

      "abstract": "Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) is a soluble dietary fiber that is effective for defecation control. It influences the gut microbiota, by which it is metabolized to yield short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and it was also recently shown to protect against influenza infection in humans. We here investigated the effects of PHGG in a mouse model of influenza H1N1 virus infection. Eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed normal chow with or without PHGG (500 mg/kg per day) for 4 weeks, infected with H1N1 at 10 weeks of age, and analyzed at 12 weeks of age. Administration of PHGG attenuated the decline in body weight induced by H1N1 infection without affecting food intake. It also ameliorated intestinal atrophy and increased the production of SCFAs including acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid in the cecum, thereby preventing the inhibitory effect of H1N1 infection on SCFA production. The H1N1-induced increases in the serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines including interferon-γ and interleukin-6 and anti-inflammatory cytokine such as interleukin-10 were all inhibited by PHGG intake. In addition, PHGG administration attenuated inflammatory gene expression in the lung and promoted both natural killer cell activity and regulatory T-cell differentiation in the spleen. Our findings suggest that the consumption of PHGG may improve the gut environment and thereby limit the inflammatory response to H1N1 infection. They may thus provide the basis for novel dietary intervention strategies to suppress the excessive inflammation associated with virus infection.",

Herein, an injectable hydrogel with moisturizing, antibacterial, and anti-inflammation abilities via multiple reversible interactions between cation guar gum (CG) and metallic-polyphenolic nanoparticles (PA-ZnII NPs) is developed. Specifically, PA-ZnII NPs is formed by synergistic complexation of protocatechualdehyde (PA) and zinc ion (Zn2+ ), provides CGPZ hydrogel with plentiful reversible interactions to inhibit the loss of moist. By interacting with PA-ZnII NPs, the CGPZ hydrogel can provide enhanced moisturization for more than 3 days. Moreover, the CGPZ hydrogel can maintain good adhesion for a period of time with injection and self-healing capabilities due to reversible interactions between CG and PA-ZnII NPs. In addition, CGPZ hydrogel exhibits outstanding broad spectrum antibacterial performance, as its killing efficiency against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus is all greater than 99.99%. Importantly, compared with commercial dressing, the CGPZ hydrogel can promote wound healing faster by inhibiting tissue damage from dysregulated inflammation and accelerating neovascularization. It is believed that the moisturizing CGPZ hydrogel with antibacterial and anti-inflammation performance can serve as a promising dressing for the effective treatment of burn wound.",

Results showed that PHGG stimulated the growth of Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium, inhibited the growth of Escherichia-Shigella, Klebsiella, and Dorea, and induced the production of fermentation gases (CO2, and H2) and SCFAs (acetic acid, butyric acid). Furthermore, Bifidobacterium was significantly increased in the young female and the old male-originated samples, while Klebsiella was significantly decreased in the old female ones after PHGG intervention, and there were also certain differences in gases and SCFAs among different population samples. These findings indicate that PHGG can modulate gut microbiota and metabolism well, whereas its use varies in different populations.",

A blended biopolymeric hydrogel was prepared by solution casting technique using guar gum (GG), chitosan (CS), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), chemically crosslinked with tetra orthosilicate (TEOS) and impregnated with methotrexate (MTX) to assess its drug carrying capacity against colon cancer (HCT-116). The surface morphology, chemical bonding, hydrophilicity and water absorbing capacity were analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), contact angle measurements and swelling properties in variable conditions. Furthermore, degradation, drug release kinetics, hemocompatibility, and cytotoxicity of MTX-loaded hydrogel was tested. The release of MTX from GG/CS/PVA biopolymeric blend occurred in sustained manner. Results displayed that in 7 h 25 min duration 96% of the drug was released in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at pH 7.4. These blends were non-hemolytic, and antiproliferative against HCT-116. Furthermore, the MTT assay has revealed that MTX-loaded hydrogel had prominently decreased the cell viability (with IC50 11.7 µg/ml) as compared to free MTX (with IC50 21.57 µg/ml). Hence, these results suggest that guar gum based hydrogels are potential biomaterials for colon cancer treatment."

So, a green chemistry approach was used to form guar gum nanoemulsions (NEs) of 186.5-394.1 nm containing the chemical fungicide mancozeb and was characterized using various physio-chemical techniques. An 84.5% inhibition was shown by 1.5 mg/mL mancozeb-loaded NEs (GG-1.5) against A. alternata, comparable to commercial mancozeb (86.5 ± 0.7%). The highest mycelial inhibition was exhibited against S. lycopersici and S. sclerotiorum. In tomatoes and potatoes, NEs showed superior antifungal efficacy in pot conditions besides plant growth parameters (germination percentage, root/shoot ratio and dry biomass). About 98% of the commercial mancozeb was released in just two h, while only about 43% of mancozeb was released from nanoemulsions (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5) for the same time. The most significant results for cell viability were seen at 1.0 mg/mL concentration of treatment, where wide gaps in cell viability were observed for commercial mancozeb (21.67%) and NEs treatments (63.83-71.88%). Thus, this study may help to combat the soil and water pollution menace of harmful chemical pesticides besides protecting vegetable crops."

Herein, guar gum (GG), a high-abundant and non-toxic natural polymer originated from the seeds of a drought-tolerant plant, Cyamposis tetragonolobus, was found to be able to enhance the fluorescence emission of gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) probe. The emission enhancement effect was achieved by using GG at very low concentrations (<1.0 wt%) and presented in a viscosity-dependent manner through increasing solvent reorientation time and inhibiting intramolecular motions of AuNCs. Furthermore, the enhanced emission of the AuNCs was quenched by Fe3+via dynamic quenching and then restored by α-Glu. Accordingly, a fluorimetric method was proposed for the determination of α-Glu. Owing to the fluorescence enhancement effect of GG on the AuNCs probe, the detection limit of the approach was 0.13 U L-1 and the detection range was up to 5 orders of magnitude from 0.2 to 4000 U L-1, which was much better than most current α-Glu detection methods. The approach was further applied to α-Glu inhibitors screening from natural plant extracts, providing great prospects for the prevention and treatment of T2D.",

The FTIR, DSC, and PXRD showed that GG was covered on the surface of TIL-nanogels in a pattern of staggered arrangements. The TIL-nanogels modified with GG had the strongest adhesive strength amongst those with I-carrageenan and locust bean gum and the plain nanogels, and thus significantly enhanced the cellular uptake and accumulation of TIL via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It exhibited an increased therapeutic effect against L.intracellularis in vitro and in vivo.

This open-label, single-arm, multicenter trial aimed to assess the tolerability and safety of a semi-elemental enteral formula containing PHGG at 12 g/L in tube-fed young children. METHODS: Children aged 1-4 years with stable conditions requiring tube feeding to provide ≥80% of their nutritional needs received the study formula for seven days. Tolerability, safety, adequacy of energy/protein intake, and weight change were assessed. RESULTS: Of 24 children (mean age 33.5 months; 10 [41.7%] female), 23 (95.8%) commenced treatment and 18 (75%) completed the study. All children had underlying neuro-developmental disabilities, often in association with gastrointestinal comorbidities requiring treatment for constipation (70.8%) or gastroesophageal reflux (66.7%). The formula was well-tolerated by 19 (82.6%) subjects, while 4 (17.4%; 95% CI: 5%, 39%) subjects withdrew early from the study due to gastrointestinal intolerance. The mean (SD) percentage energy and protein intake across the 7-day period were 103.5% (24.7) and 139.5% [50], respectively. Weight remained stable over the 7-day period (p = 0.43). The study formula was associated with a shift towards softer and more frequent stools. Pre-existing constipation was generally well controlled, and 3/16 (18.7%) subjects ceased laxatives during the study. Adverse events were reported in 12 (52%) subjects and were deemed 'probably related' or 'related' to the formula in 3 (13%) subjects. Gastrointestinal adverse events appeared more common in fiber-naïve patients (p = 0.09). CONCLUSION: The present study indicates that the study formula was safe and generally well tolerated in young tube-fed children. GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT04516213.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to fabricate celecoxib-loaded chitosan/guar gum (CS/GG) single (SC) and dual (DC) crosslinked hydrogel beads using the ionotropic gelation approach. The prepared formulations were evaluated for entrapment efficiency (EE%), loading efficiency (LE%), particle size and swelling studies. The performance efficiency was assessed by in vitro drug release, ex-vivo mucoadhesion, permeability, ex-in vivo swelling and in vivo anti-inflammatory studies. The EE% was found to be ~55% and ~44% for SC5 and DC5 beads, respectively. The LE% was ~11% and ~7% for SC5 and DC5 beads, respectively. The beads showed a matrix-like network with thick fibers. The particle size of beads ranged from ~2.74 to 1.91 mm. About 74% and 24% celecoxib was released from SC and DC hydrogel beads, respectively, within 24 h. The SC formulation showed higher %swelling and permeability than the DC counterpart, while the %mucoadhesion was relatively higher for DC beads. During the in vivo study, a significant decrease in the inflammation of the rat paw and inflammatory markers including C-reactive proteins (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was observed following treatment with the prepared hydrogel beads; however, the SC formulation showed better therapeutic efficiency. In conclusion, celecoxib-loaded crosslinked CS/GG hydrogel beads can provide sustained drug release and act as potential candidates for managing inflammatory conditions."

      "abstract": "The applications of hydrogels are prominently affected by the modulation of their structure and performance. We herein systematically implemented the modulation of an all-polysaccharide hydrogel consisting of TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TOCN) and cationic guar gum (CGG). Four different factors including the carboxylate content and size of TOCN, the freezing-thawing treatment and solid content of hydrogel were studied to disclose their influence on the structure and property of TOCN/CGG hydrogel. The results indicated that the increase of carboxylate content of TOCN, the number of freezing-thawing cycles and solid content all increased the crosslinking density of hydrogel as a result of the improved interactions. Accordingly, the hydrogels exhibited more compact structures and enhanced rheological properties. The influence of TOCN size on the hydrogel structure and property was demonstrated to be dependent on the compromise between the exposed functional groups of TOCN and their ability in generating entanglements inside the hydrogel. This work helps shed light on the modulation of hydrogel structure and performance, which might facilitate the exploration of hydrogel applications.",

METHODS: Relevant studies were obtained by searching the PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase, and Web of Science databases (from inception to January 2022). Weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias were reported using standard methods. RESULTS: Pooled analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) revealed that guar gum supplementation led to significant reductions in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (WMD: -0.47 mg/dL, 95% CI: -0.75, -0.18, p = 0.001). However, there was no effect on fasting blood sugar (FBS), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and body mass among adults in comparison with the control group. A subgroup analysis demonstrated that intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and high supplementation dosages (>15 g/d) significantly decreased FBS concentrations, but not in other subgroups. CONCLUSION: Guar gum supplementation may yield a beneficial effect on glycemic control in T2DM patients. However, the extant clinical trials, thus far, are not sufficient enough to form guidelines for clinical practice.",

The results showed that the addition of GG significantly increased the viscosity, gel strength and viscoelasticity of GBS, which was beneficial to the formation of gel, and promoted its formation of an ordered and compact gel network structure.

Due to the entanglement behaviors and hydrogen bond interactions, GG could inhibit the formation of helical and crystalline structures of CS. When FA was introduced simultaneously, FA could weaken the interactions between GG and CS as well as enter the spiral cavity of starch to increase the single/double helix and V-type crystalline structures while reducing A-type crystalline. Based on the above structural changes, ET with starch-GG-FA molecular interactions resulted in resistant starch content of 20.31% and anti-retrogradation rate of 42.98% for 21-day storage.

The structure, morphology, and physics-chemical of DGH were fully characterized by multiple analysis techniques. The as-prepared adsorbent yielded highly efficient separating performance towards multiple anionic and cation dyes, including CR, MG, and ST with the maximum adsorption capacity of 1065.3839 ± 10.5695, 1256.4467 ± 2.9425, and 1043.8140 ± 0.9789 mg/g at 298.15 K, respectively. The adsorption process well fitted the Langmuir isotherm models and the pseudo-second-order kinetic models. The adsorption thermodynamics revealed that the adsorption of dyes onto DGH was spontaneous and endothermic. The adsorption mechanism indicated that the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction participated in the fast and efficient removal of dyes. Furthermore, the removal efficiency of DGH still remained above 90 % after six adsorption-desorption cycles, and the presence of Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ have weakly impacted the removal efficiency of DGH. The phytotoxicity assay was conducted via the germination of mung bean seeds, which confirmed the adsorbent can effectivity decreased the toxicity of dyes. Overall, the modified gum-based multifunctional material has good promising applications for wastewater treatment.",

      "abstract": "An increase in resistance to key antibiotics has made the need for novel treatments for the gastric colonization of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) a matter of the utmost urgency. Recent studies tackling this topic have focused either on the discovery of new compounds to ameliorate therapeutic regimes (such as vonoprazan) or the synthesis of gastroretentive drug delivery systems (GRDDSs) to improve the pharmacokinetics of oral formulations. The use of semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (semi-IPNs) that can act as super-porous hydrogels for this purpose is proposed in the present work, specifically those displaying low ecological footprint, easy synthesis, self-floating properties, high encapsulation efficiency for drugs such as amoxicillin (AMOX), great mucoadhesiveness, and optimal mechanical strength when exposed to stomach-like fluids. To achieve such systems, biodegradable synthetic copolymers containing acid-labile monomers were prepared and interpenetrated with guar gum (GG) in a one-pot polymerization process based on thiol-ene click reactions. The resulting matrices were characterized by SEM, GPC, TGA, NMR, and rheology studies, and the acidic hydrolysis of the acid-sensitive polymers was also studied. Results confirm that some of the obtained matrices are expected to perform optimally as GRDDSs for the sustained release of active pharmaceutical ingredients at the gastrointestinal level, being a priori facilitated by its disaggregation. Therefore, the optimal performance of these systems is assessed by varying the molar ratio of the labile monomer in the matrices.",

Sesamol is a phenolic compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This study was designed to evaluate a hydrogel containing sesamol-loaded ethylcellulose nanocapsules for the treatment of irritant contact dermatitis. The nanocapsules presented a size in the nanometric range, a negative zeta potential, a sesamol content close to the theoretical value (1 mg/mL), and a 65% encapsulation efficiency. Nanoencapsulation protected sesamol against UVC-induced degradation and increased the scavenging activity assessed by ABTS and DPPH radicals. The hydrogels were prepared by thickening the nanocapsule suspensions with guar gum (2.5%). The hydrogels maintained the nanometric size of the nanocapsules and a sesamol content of approximately 1 mg/g. The HET-CAM assay classified the hydrogels as nonirritating. The in vitro release of the hydrogel containing sesamol in the nanoencapsulated form demonstrated an initial burst effect followed by a prolonged sesamol release and a lower skin permeation in comparison with the hydrogel containing free sesamol. In addition, it exhibited the best anti-inflammatory effect in the irritant contact dermatitis model induced by croton oil, reducing ear edema and inflammatory cells infiltration, similar to dexamethasone (positive control). Therefore, the hydrogel containing sesamol in the nanoencapsulated form seemed to have a therapeutic potential in treating irritant contact dermatitis."

In this regard, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal ratio was evaluated with various influencing operating factors including reaction time, H2O2 concentration, Fe2+ concentration, ultrasonic power, initial pH, and temperature. The optimal operating parameters by single-factor analysis method were: the pH of 3.0, the H2O2 concentration of 80 mM, the Fe2+ concentration of 5 mM, the ultrasonic power of 180 W, the ultrasonic frequency of 20-25 kHz, the temperature of 39 ℃, the reaction time of 30 min, and the COD removal rate reached 81.15 %, which was permissible to discharge surface water sources based on the environmental standards. A possible mechanism for HPG degradation and the generation of reactive species was proposed. Results of quenching tests showed that various impacts of the decomposition rate by addition of scavengers had followed the order of EDTA-2Na < BQ < t-BuOH, therefore OH radicals had a dominant role in destructing the HPG. Based on the kinetic study, it was concluded that Chan Kinetic Model was more appropriate to describe the degradation of HPG. Identification of intermediates by GC-MS showed that a wide range of recalcitrant compounds was removed and/or degraded into small molecular compounds effectively after treatment. Under the optimal conditions, the sono-Fenton system was used to treat the fracturing flowback fluid with the initial COD value of 675.21 mg/L, and the COD value decreased to 80.83 mg/L after 60 min treatment, which was in line with the marine sewage discharge standard. In conclusion, sono-Fenton system can be introduced as a successful advanced treatment process for the efficient remediation of fracture flowback fluid."

Within this context, the use of polysaccharides from plants and seeds in innovative biopolymer technologies is of key importance. In this work, bio-nano-composite guar gum/polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) membranes loaded with aluminum-doped zinc oxide nanoparticles were produced via electrospinning. Citric acid was added to the mixture to increase spinnability. However, depending on the pH, zinc oxide nanoparticles are partially dissociated, decreasing their bactericidal efficiency. Thus, a second successful alkaline thermo-chemical regrowth step was added to the process to treat the obtained fibers. This alkaline thermo-chemical treatment reconstituted both the nanoparticles and their bactericidal properties. The Staphylococcus aureus antibacterial assay results show that the membranes obtained after the alkaline thermo-chemical treatment presented a 57% increase in growth inhibition."

Several studies have shown that XH has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, suggesting that it could be a good candidate for the treatment of colorectal diseases (CRD). Despite its potential, XH has a low aqueous solubility. As a result, its bioavailability is constrained by the dissolution rate. The liquid (L)-SNEDDS was constituted using Labrafac PG as oil, Tween 80 as surfactant and Transcutol P as co-surfactant. The L-SNEDDS was then adsorbed onto the surface of guar gum and pectin and developed into S-SNEDDS powder. Ternary phase diagram was used to optimize the process of developing L-SNEDDS. The formulation showed mean droplet size of 118.96 ± 5.94 nm and zeta potential of -19.08 ± 0.95 mV and drug loading of 94.20 ± 4.71%. Dissolution studies carried out in medium containing rat caecal contents (RCC) represented the targeted release of S-SNEDDS powder. It was observed that S-SNEDDS showed less than 10% release XH in initial 5 h and rapid release occurred between the 5th and 10th hour. Results of cytotoxicity studies revealed good cytotoxicity of XH loaded S-SNEDDS for Caco2 cells as compared to raw-XH."

Here, the anti-obesity effect of low molecular weight hydrolyzed guar gum (GMLP, 1-10 kDa) on high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6 J mice was investigated via transcriptome and metabolome in liver. GMLP reduced body weight gain and hepatic lipid accumulation dose-dependently, regulated blood lipid levels, and improved liver damage in HFD-fed mice. Integrated transcriptome and metabolome indicated that GMLP mainly altered lipid metabolism pathways (glycerophospholipid metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism, and fatty acid degradation), reduced disease biomarkers of ethyl glucuronide and neopterin, and increased levels of choline, flavin adenine dinucleotide, and pantetheine metabolites. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that GMLP downregulated key genes involved in de novo lipogenesis and triacylglycerol synthesis, while promoting fatty acid oxidation and choline synthesis. This study provides a theoretical basis for GMLP treatment in future clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to develop a Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum)-loaded dual-layer wound dressing (DLD) with excellent wound recovery and mechanical properties. L. plantarum-loaded DLD was fabricated by covering the hydrogel (inner layer) with a hydrocolloid (external layer). The hydrocolloid was manufactured by the hot-melt method, consisting of liquid paraffin, polyisobutylene, styrene-isoprene-styrene, and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (12:20:25:43, w/w/w/w). In contrast, the hydrogel was fabricated by the freeze-and-thaw method to load heat-labile L. plantarum. Various non-ionic materials have been investigated to select appropriate hydrogel components. The hydrogel composed of L. plantarum stock solution, guar gum, and polyvinyl alcohol (10:2:10, w/w/w) was chosen for its excellent swelling capacity and mechanical properties. As a result, heat-labile L. plantarum was successfully loaded into the guar-gum-based DLD. Moreover, guar gum-based DLD containing L. plantarum exhibited significantly enhanced swelling capacity and elasticity compared to single hydrogel layer (swelling capacity: DLD, 920.7 ± 32.4 % vs. hydrogel, 282.2 ± 6.5 %; elastic modulus: DLD, 2.9 ± 0.3 × 10-3 N/mm2 vs. hydrogel, 4.2. ± 0.7 × 10-3 N/mm2). The wound recovery test using Pseudomonas aeruginosa-infected animal model and histological profiles confirmed guar gum-based DLD containing L. plantarum to elicit accelerated wound recovery with complete re-epithelialization compared to commercial product and non-treated (recovery rate at Day 3: DLD, 67.8 ± 6.2 % vs. commercial product, 30.4 ± 11.7 % vs. non-treated, 14.2 ± 7.5 %). Therefore, L. plantarum-loaded DLD is an effective system for wound treatment.",

Herein, a multi-bioresponsive anti-inflammatory drug (curcumin, CUR)-loaded heterogeneous double-membrane microgels (CUR@microgels) for oral administration was fabricated in this study, in which the inner core was derived from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and guar gum (GG) and the outer gel was decoration with alginate and chitosan by polyelectrolyte interactions. The structure and morphology of microgels were characterized. In vitro, the formulation exhibited good bio-responses at different pH conditions and sustained-release properties in simulated colon fluid with a drug-release rate of 84.6 % over 34 h. With the assistance of the outlayer gels, the microgels effectively delayed the premature drug release of CUR in the upper gastrointestinal tract. In vivo studies revealed that CUR@microgels specifically accumulated in the colon tissue for 24 h, which suggest that the interlayer gels were apt to reach colon lesion. As expected, the oral administration of microgels remarkably alleviated the symptoms of UC and protected the colon tissue in DSS-induced UC mice. The above results indicated that these facilely fabricated microgels which exhibited excellent biocompatibility and multi-bioresponsive drug release, had an apparent effect on the treatment of UC, which represents a promising drug delivery strategy for CUR in a clinical application.",

Here, we investigated whether partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG), a dietary fiber could alleviate liver damage and modulate the gut microbiota in a murine liver injury (LI) model. METHODS: Liver injury was induced in 6-week-old male C57BL/6 mice using an enteral liquid diet composed of parenteral nutrition (LI group) and treated with 5% PHGG (LI/PHGG group). Liver histopathology was examined using oil red O and a tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) labeling. The gut microbiota was examined using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: Lipid accumulation was significantly decreased in the LI /PHGG group when compared with that of the LI group. The area of TNF-α-positive cells was significantly higher in the LI group when compared with that of the control. The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) revealed pronounced changes in the gut microbiota after PHGG treatment. Linear discriminant analysis of effect size showed that PHGG treatment significantly increased cecal abundance of Parabacteroides. CONCLUSIONS: PHGG alleviated hepatic steatosis following liver injury in mice. The protective effect of PHGG treatment could be associated with increased abundance of Parabacteroides in the cecum.",

      "abstract": "Oral delivery of paliperidone palmitate (PPD), a potent antipsychotic agent, has been reported with a potential risk of very serious drug-induced adverse events such as tachycardia, hyperprolactinemia, sexual dysfunction, and neutropenia. Alternatively, the potential of nasal delivery has also been explored to treat CNS complications by delivering the medicines directly to the brain bypassing the blood-brain barrier. Hence, the objectives of current work were to formulate, design, optimize, and investigate the therapeutic potency of PPD-loaded intranasal in-situ gel (PPGISG) in the treatment of schizophrenia. PPD-nanoemulsion (PNE) was fabricated using water titration technique, was further optimized via Box-Behnken design. Furthermore, the optimized PNE was evaluated for parameters such as globule size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, and % entrapment efficiency were found to be 21.44±1.58nm, 0.268±0.02, -25.56±1.6mV, and 99.89±0.25%, respectively. PNE was further converted to PPGISG utilizing two polymers, poloxamer, and guar gum. Simultaneously, ex-vivo permeation for PNE, PPGISG, and PPD-suspension was found to be 211.40±4.8, 297.89±3.9 and 98.66±1.6μg/cm2, respectively. While PPGISG nanoparticles showed 1.58 and 5.65-folds more Jss than PNE and PPD-suspension. Behavioral studies confirmed that no extrapyramidal symptoms were observed in experimental animals post intranasal administration. Finally, the outcomes of the in-vivo hemato-compatibility study proved that intranasal formulation did not cause any alteration in leukocytes, RBCs, and neutrophils count. Therefore, intranasal delivery of PPGISG can be considered a novel tool for the safe delivery of PPD in schizophrenic patients.",

DESIGN: A single-center, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded parallel-group trial from September 2021 to November 2021. SETTING: Four LTCF in Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-two LTCF residents with chronic constipation (mean age: 83.9±7.6 years, male 38%). INTERVENTION: 5g PHGG mixed with 200ml water per day for 4 weeks was given to intervention group participants. Control group received 200ml water for 4 weeks. Participants continued their usual as-needed laxative (lactulose, senna or dulcolax) on their own initiative. MEASUREMENTS: Baseline measurements included age, gender, Charlson comorbidity index, Roackwood's Clinical Frailty Scale, body mass index and daily dietary fiber intake. Outcome measures were fecal characteristics assessed by Bristol Stool Form Scale, bowel opening frequency and laxative use frequency at baseline, first, second, third and fourth week of trial. Adverse events were measured. The study was registered on ClinicalTrial.gov; identifier: NCT05037565. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in bowel frequency and stool characteristics between the treatment group and control group. However, there was a significantly lower frequency of lactulose, senna, and total laxative use in the treatment group compared with controls in the third and fourth week. There was no significant difference in adverse effects between the two groups. CONCLUSION: This study showed that daily dietary fibre supplementation by using PHGG for 4 weeks in LTCF residents results in significantly less laxative use than placebo. It may be an effective way to reduce laxative dependence among older people living in LTCFs.",

      "abstract": "Using of plant essential oil that coevolved as a defense mechanism against agriculture insects is an alternative means of controlling many insect pests. In order to repel brown planthoppers (BPHs), the most notorious rice insect pest, a new film based on guar gum incorporated with citral (GC film) was formulated, which was effective while being environmentally friendly. In this paper, the effect and mechanism of GC film repellency against BPHs were determined. Repellent activity test and olfactory reaction analysis showed that GC film had repellency effect against BPHs, with repellency of 60.00% and 73.93%, respectively. The result of olfactory reaction indicated that GC film repellency against BPHs relied on smell. EPG analysis showed the proportion and mean duration of np waveform were significantly higher than in CK and increased following the treatment concentration, which indicated that GC film affected the recognition of BPHs to rice. Further analysis by RNA sequencing analysis showed a total of 679 genes were significantly upregulated and 284 genes were significantly downregulated in the BPHs fed on the rice sprayed with GC film compared to control. Odorant-binding protein (OBP) gene 797 and gustatory receptor gene (GR)/odorant receptor (OR) gene 13110 showed a significant decrease in differential expression and significant increase in differential expression, respectively. There were 0.66 and 2.55 differential expression multiples between treated BPHs and control, respectively. According to the results described above, we reasoned that GC film repellency against BPHs due to smell, by release of citral, caused the recognition difficulties for BPHs to rice, and OBP gene 797 and GR/OR gene 13110 appeared to be the crucial candidate genes for GC film repellency against BPHs. The present study depicted a clear and consistent repellency effect for GC film against BPHs and preliminarily clarified the mechanism of GC film as a repellent against BPHs, which might offer an alternative approach for control of BPHs in the near future. Our results could also help in the development and improvement of GC films.",

      "abstract": "Periodontal pain is a public health problem derived from different conditions, including periodontal diseases, prosthetic complications, and even extractions performed by dentist. There are various treatments to control acute dental pain, being the administration of analgesics, such as Lysine Clonixinate (LC), a common practice. Unfortunately, higher and repeated dosages are usually required. The purpose of this work was to develop a prolonged release pharmaceutical form as an alternative treatment for dental pain. Hence, we conceived a film based on guar gum and loaded different concentrations of LC. We evaluated the film's appearance, brittleness, strength, and flexibility, and then chose one formulation for adequate characteristics. Subsequently, we assessed the morphology, thermal behavior, and swelling properties of the films (LC-free and -loaded). Finally, we performed the release studies of LC from the films in vitro using a simulated saliva medium and employed several mathematical models to evaluate the release kinetics. Guar gum is a natural polymer obtained from the endosperm of Cyamopsis tetragonolobus that presents properties such as biosafety, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. Thus, it represents a potential excipient for use in pharmaceutical formulations. Moreover, our results revealed that the LC-loaded film presented a high adherence, suitable swelling behavior, high LC content, and a prolonged drug release. Therefore, the LC-loaded film may be considered a potential option to be applied as an alternative to treat dental pain.",

This work aims to synthesize composite hydrogel from the combination of guar gum (a neutral galactomannan polysaccharide) and TiO2. The TiO2-embedded guar gum hydrogel (TiO2@GGH) was utilized to remove methylene blue through adsorption and photodegradation. The presence of TiO2 particles in the hydrogel matrix (TiO2@GGH) was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The mercury intrusion and N2 sorption isotherm indicate the macroporous structure of the TiO2@GGH composite, showing the presence of pore sizes ~420 μm. The dye removal efficiency of the GGH and TiO2@GGH was evaluated in batch mode at ambient temperature under varying pH. The effect of UV radiation on the dye removal efficiency was also assessed. The results demonstrated that the highest dye removal was recorded at pH 10, with the equilibrium condition achieved within 5 h. UV radiation was shown to enhance dye removal. The maximum adsorption capacity of TiO2@GGH is 198.61 mg g-1, while GGH sorbent is 188.53 mg g-1. The results imply that UV radiation gives rise to the photodegradation effect.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Guar gum can be used as an adjuvant in the treatment of dyslipidemia. However, based on data from different studies, the effectiveness of this product is not uniform. Therefore, we conducted a dose-response meta-analysis between guar gum supplementation and lipid profile. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar) were searched to identify relevant articles published up to July 2020. The weighted mean difference (WMD) was derived based on the random-effects model. Overall findings were generated from 25 eligible trials. Patients' conditions included hyperlipidemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, overweight, carotid endarterectomy, and menopausal women. Prescribed gum dose varied between 100 mg/d and 30 g/d for 1-24 months. Compared with control groups, guar gum supplementation decreased total cholesterol (TC) by -20.41 mg/dL (95% CI: -26.76 to -14.07; P < 0.001) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) by -17.37 mg/dL (95% CI: -23.60 to -11.13; P < 0.001), but did not change triglycerides (TG) (WMD: -6.53 mg/dL, 95% CI: -16.03 to 2.97; P = 0.178) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (WMD: -0.62 mg/dL, 95% CI: -1.68 to 0.44, P = 0.252). CONCLUSIONS: Guar gum supplementation significantly reduced serum LDL-C and TC levels in patients with cardiometabolic problems, but had neutral effects on TG and HDL-C levels.",

      "abstract": "Guar gum-derived galactomannan (GGGM) has been widely used in the food industry for a long time and its adverse impacts have been scarcely reported. Galactomannan is considered to have a structure similar to the surface components of certain pathogens, and the present study was thus conducted to investigate if oral administration of GGGM could cause physiological effects that were hypothesized to be related to intestinal inflammatory responses. The results showed that oral administration of GGGM resulted in compromises on growth performance, an increase of the relative weight of spleen and epididymal fat, and an elevation of the α1-acid glycoprotein content in both serum and livers of mice. With regard to energy metabolism-related indices, the activities of intestinal lactic dehydrogenase and succinic dehydrogenase were all increased by the GGGM treatment in both in vivo and in vitro experiments, the latter of which also showed an elevation in the consumption of reducing sugar by intestinal epithelial cells along with a reduced viability of these cells in response to the GGGM treatment. Notably, the GGGM treatment triggered intestinal inflammatory responses that were evidenced by the increased expression of intestinal inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 both in vivo and in vitro, which were at least partially responsible for the increased energy expenditure in the intestine and the retardation of growth. The results of this study could expand our knowledge of GGGM administration and provide integrated insights into the consumption of GGGM-containing foods.",

In this study, it is explored whether partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) is a safe food that exhibits protection in a mouse model of depression. METHODS AND RESULTS: PHGG is orally administered to mice with depression induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in two animal experiments (prevention trial and intervention trial) to characterize the potentially protective effect of PHGG. The results in the prevention trial show that PHGG significantly inhibits the loss of body weight, and prevents CUMS-induced depressive-like behavior in mice. The beneficial effects may be associated with PHGG modulating the gut microbiota structure and then increasing the levels of short-chain fatty acids in mice feces and the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine in serum, striatum, and hippocampus. Besides, PHGG in the intervention trial is less effective than that in the prevention trial, but it may have a synergistic effect on improving depression with fluoxetine. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that moderate daily intake of PHGG can contribute to relieving depressive-like behavior.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The gut-liver axis has attracted much interest in the context of chronic liver disease pathogenesis. Prebiotics such as dietary fibers were shown to attenuate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by modulating gut microbiota. Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG), a water-soluble dietary fiber, has been reported to alleviate the symptoms of various intestinal diseases and metabolic syndromes. However, its effects on NAFLD remain to be fully elucidated. AIM: To determine whether treatment with PHGG attenuates NAFLD development in mice through the gut-liver axis. METHODS: Seven-week-old male C57BL/6J mice with increased intestinal permeability were fed a control or atherogenic (Ath) diet (a mouse model of NAFLD) for 8 wk, with or without 5% PHGG. Increased intestinal permeability was induced through chronic intermittent administration of low-dose dextran sulfate sodium. Body weight, liver weight, macroscopic findings in the liver, blood biochemistry [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total cholesterol, triglyceride, free fatty acids, and glucose levels], liver histology, myeloperoxidase activity in liver tissue, mRNA expression in the liver and intestine, serum endotoxin levels in the portal vein, intestinal permeability, and microbiota and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profiles in the cecal samples were investigated. RESULTS: Mice with increased intestinal permeability subjected to the Ath diet showed significantly increased serum AST and ALT levels, liver fat accumulation, liver inflammatory (tumor necrosis factor-α and monocyte chemotactic protein-1) and fibrogenic (collagen 1a1 and α smooth muscle actin) marker levels, and liver myeloperoxidase activity, which were significantly attenuated by PHGG treatment. Furthermore, the Ath diet combined with increased intestinal permeability resulted in elevated portal endotoxin levels and activated toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and TLR9 expression, confirming that intestinal permeability was significantly elevated, as observed by evaluating the lumen-to-blood clearance of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated dextran. PHGG treatment did not affect fatty acid metabolism in the liver. However, it decreased lipopolysaccharide signaling through the gut-liver axis. In addition, it significantly increased the abundance of cecal Bacteroides and Clostridium subcluster XIVa. Treatment with PHGG markedly increased the levels of SCFAs, particularly, butyric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, and formic acid, in the cecal samples. CONCLUSION: PHGG partially prevented NAFLD development in mice through the gut-liver axis by modulating microbiota and downstream SCFA profiles.",

In this study, acacia and guar gum were investigated beyond their typical functionality for a possible additive anti-inflammatory effect when administered with 5-amino salicylic acid (5ASA) in murine experimental colitis. Anti-inflammatory effects of acacia and guar gum-based aqueous suspensions of 5ASA were evaluated in a murine experimental colitis. Acacia or guar gum (30 or 300 mg/kg) were administered via rectal administration alone or in combination with 5ASA (30 mg/kg). Disease activity, myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) and intratissue concentrations of various cytokines were assessed. Both acacia and guar gum separately showed significant effects in reducing the inflammatory markers in murine colitis model in vivo. When combined with the anti-inflammatory drug 5ASA, acacia showed a stronger therapeutic effect than guar gum, especially at the higher dose of acacia (300 mg/kg) which significantly reduced the inflammation in vivo compared to 5ASA alone (MPO, 5ASA: 5743 ± 1334, 5ASA + 30 mg/kg acacia: 3762 ± 2342; 5ASA + 30 mg/kg guar gum: 7373 ± 2115, 5ASA + 300 mg/kg acacia: 3131 ± 1012, 5ASA + 300 mg/kg guar gum: 6358 ± 2379; all U/g tissue). Acacia and guar gum separately showed significant anti-inflammatory effects in murine colitis, and furthermore, high dose acacia led to an additional therapeutic benefit when co-administered with 5ASA. These results indicate that further investigations are surely warranted in the search of better colitis therapy."

The phosphorylation of guar gum combined with its association to chitosan allows preparing an efficient sorbent for the removal of U(VI) from slightly acidic solutions. The incorporation of magnetite nanoparticles enhances solid/liquid. Functional groups are characterized by FTIR spectroscopy while textural properties are qualified by N2 adsorption. The optimum pH is close to 4 (deprotonation of amine and phosphonate groups). Uptake kinetics are fast (60 min of contact), fitted by a pseudo-first order rate equation. Maximum sorption capacities are close to 1.28 and 1.16 mmol U g-1 (non-magnetic and magnetic, respectively), while the sorption isotherms are fitted by Langmuir equation. Uranyl desorption (using 0.2 M HCl solutions) is achieved within 20-30 min; the sorbents can be recycled for at least five cycles (5-6% loss in sorption performance, complete desorption). In multi-component solutions, the sorbents show marked preference for U(VI) and Nd(III) over alkali-earth metals and Si(IV). The zone of exclusion method shows that magnetic sorbent has antibacterial effects against both Gram+ and Gram- bacteria, contrary to non-magnetic material (only Gram+ bacteria). The magnetic composite is highly promising as antimicrobial support and for recovery of valuable metals.",

METHODS: The study was conducted in Arak Islamic Azad University, 2019. After preparation of ethyl cellulose nanofibers containing guar gum with concentrations 10, 250, 50 and 500 ppm with ESM, the uniformity and fineness of nanofibers were investigated by electron microscope. By determining the absorption of nanofibers during 312 h via spectrophotometry method, the amount of drug release was obtained. Then, the mortality of live protoscoleces in-vitro with nanofibers made with different concentrations was studied during 13 days. RESULTS: Guar gum nanofiber with four concentrations of 10, 50, 250 and 500 ppm had 0.78512, 0.83729, 1.0098 and 1.0633 absorption respectively and showed drug release 42.09%, 39.95%, 33.05% and 30.96% after 312 hours. Therefore, the survival of protoscoleces in the presence of guar gum with four concentrations was zero after 3, 6, 11 and 13 days (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: To produce nanofibers carrying the drug for research related to the treatment of hydatid cysts, the electrospinning technique can be considered as a reliable method."

Biopolymers such as guar gum, owing to its high abundance, low cost and non-toxicity, are potential candidates in this field. Plenty of hydroxyl groups in the polymer backbone enable guar gum to be functionalised or grafted in a versatile manner proving itself as an excellent starting substance for fabricating upgraded materials meant for diverse applications. This review offers a comprehensive coverage of the role of guar gum-based nanocomposites in removal of dyes and heavy metal ions from waste water through adsorption and photo-catalytic degradation. Isotherm and kinetics models, fabrication routes, characterisation techniques, swelling properties and reusability as well as adsorption and degradation mechanisms are outlined. A detailed analysis with convincing results suggests a good future perspective of implementation of these materials in real-time wastewater treatment technology."

Typically, fracturing fluids contain various additives such as cross linkers, thickeners and proppants, and so forth, which makes it possess the properties of considerably complicated components and difficult processing procedure. There are still some difficult points needing to be explored and resolved in the hydroxypropyl guar gum (HPG) removal process, e.g., high viscosity and removal of macromolecular organic compounds. Our works provided a facile and economical HPG removal technology for fracturing fluids by designing a series of processes including gel-breaking, coagulation and precipitation according to the diffusion double layer theory. After this treatment process, the fracturing fluid can meet the requirements of reinjection, and the whole process was environment friendly without secondary pollution characteristics. In this work, the fracturing fluid were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy technologies, etc. Further, the micro-stabilization and destabilization mechanisms of HPG in fracturing fluid were carefully investigated. This study maybe opens up new perspective for HPG removal technologies, exhibiting a low cost and strong applicability in both fundamental research and practical applications.",

In this study, a composite material of acrylic acid as the polymerization monomer grafted sodium lignosulfonate and guar gum was prepared, which provided a channel for adsorbing metal ions with its abundant active functional groups and porous structure. The optimized synthesized product was applied to the removal of Cu2+ and Co2+ in a one-component system and a multi-component system, and the maximum ion adsorption capacities obtained were determined to be 709 mg g-1 of Cu2+, 601 mg g-1 of Co2+, respectively. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms were well fitted by the pseudo second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm, showing that the adsorption of Cu2+ and Co2+ by the adsorbent belongs to the chemisorption on monolayer. XPS results confirmed the successful adsorption of Cu2+ and Co2+ by GG/SLS. Surface complexation was proposed to be the main mechanism for GG/SLS adsorbent to remove heavy metal ions. In addition, the use of recycling research showed that the adsorbent has good chemical stability. These results provided valuable information for designing highly efficient adsorbents that can be used as a high-quality wastewater treatment material.",

For this purpose, the curcumin loaded Zein nanoparticles/aldehyde-modified guar gum/silk fibroin (Cur-NPs/OGG/SF) hydrogel networks were successfully developed to increase the Cur bioavailability during the wound treatment procedure. Fabricated hydrogels were assessed for their morphological, thermal stability, degradation, and mechanical features. By varying the OGG/SF weight ratios, the physicochemical features of hydrogels without or with Cur-loaded Zein NPs were studied. The results showed that with enhancing the OGG content, the degradation behavior of hydrogels were improved. Besides, Cur-NPs/OGG/SF hydrogels increased the cell proliferation without any cytotoxic effect on mouse embryonic fibroblast (NIH-3T3) cells. The Cur-NPs/OGG/SF hydrogel exposed inhibition activity against Bacillus (15.26 ± 1.09 mm) and E. coli (11.54± 1.36 mm) bacteria. These achieved results recommended that the novel developed hydrogel could be suitable for wound healing application.",

The effects of the most relevant operating factors (H2O2 concentration, catalyst dosage, temperature and pH) were evaluated in detail. Moreover, the chemical oxygen demand removal rate of HPGG can achieve 76% when the reaction time was selected at 45 min under optimal experimental conditions. The stability evaluation showed that the catalytic performance was almost unaffected after the catalyst was recycled and used once more showing the good stability of the bentonite-supported zero-valent copper in the application process.",

To develop preservation alternatives, the effect and interaction of a modified atmosphere packaging and an edible coating based on guar gum were determined on the shelf life and quality properties of blackberry cv. Castilla stored at 5 ℃. Three types of packaging were evaluated: (1) perforated polyethylene terephthalate clamshells, (2) sealed polyethylene terephthalate clamshells, and (3) sealed polyethylene terephthalate clamshells with a polylactic acid film on top. In turn, two types of coating were evaluated: coatings of guar gum solutions at (1) 0.3% and (2) 0.4% in water. During storage, an index of deterioration and different quality properties were evaluated. In the polyethylene terephthalate packages with polylactic acid, an equilibrium modified atmosphere packaging was formed. Weight loss was much lower for the sealed polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene terephthalate + polylactic acid (<2%) compared to fruits in perforated clamshells, with no significant differences between these two types of packaging. It was possible to observe the treatment with an edible coating of 0.3% gum guar and perforated clamshells (guar gum 0.3/N) presented the lowest deterioration rate and preserve the fruit longer time (13 days) although with a high weight loss (23.23%) while the treatment with polyethylene terephthalate and polylactic acid film + edible coating of gum guar (guar gum 03/polylactic acid) kept the samples during 12 days with a lower weight loss (1.75%). This latter combination of equilibrium modified atmosphere packaging with a biodegradable film and the guar gum edible coating can be an interesting treatment from a commercial point of view.",

To clarify the supplemental effect of voluntary exercise on gut microbiota in partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG), which is a soluble dietary fiber, treated mice under high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, 4-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (n = 80) were randomly divided into two dietary groups: the control-diet (CD) and HFD. Then, each dietary group was treated with or without PHGG, and with or without wheel running. After the experimental period, measurement of maximal oxygen consumption, a glucose tolerance test and fecal materials collection for analysis of gut microbiota were carried out. Voluntary exercise load in PHGG treatment under HFD feeding showed the supplemental effect of exercise on obesity (p < 0.01) and glucose tolerance (p < 0.01). Additionally, in both CD and HFD groups, voluntary exercise accelerated the decrease in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in mice fed with PHGG (p < 0.01). These findings suggest that voluntary exercise might activate the prevention of obesity and insulin resistance more via change in gut microbiota in mice administrated with PHGG.",

This study aimed to determine the efficacy of partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) usage in reducing radiotherapy-induced diarrhea and improving bacterial count, nutrition status, and quality of life (QoL) among cancer patients. METHODS: Adult patients undergoing pelvic radiation were recruited and randomly assigned to receive supplementation of either 10 g of PHGG or placebo (maltodextrin) twice daily, 14 days prior and 14 days during pelvic radiation. Diarrhea frequency, fecal samples, nutrition status, and QoL were assessed at baseline and days 14, 28 (2 weeks after pelvic radiation), and 45 (at the completion of pelvic radiation, 2 weeks' postsupplementation). RESULTS: A total of 30 patients (mean age 56.5 ± 10.8 years, 75% malnourished) participated. The mean of diarrhea frequency in the intervention group (IG) was higher compared with the control group (CG) from days 14 and 28 but reduced at day 45. There was a significant intervention effect after controlling for confounders (ie, baseline diarrhea, age, nutrition status) (P < .05). Bifidobacterium count increased by double among the IG at 14 days of PHGG supplementation, whereas such trend was not observed in the CG. CONCLUSION: Supplementation of PHGG potentially increased the bifidobacterial count and seemed to have post-supplementation effects by reducing the frequency of diarrhea upon the completion of pelvic radiation treatment.",

Thus, selecting a natural coagulant in leachate treatment is a crucial step in landfill operation to prevent secondary environmental pollution due to residual inorganic coagulant in treated effluent. Current study investigated the application of guar gum in landfill leachate treatment. Central composite design in response surface methodology was used to optimize the performance of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal. Quadratic model developed indicated the optimum COD removal 22.57% at guar gum dosage of 44.39 mg/L, pH 8.56 (natural pH of leachate) and mixing speed 79.27 rpm. Scanning electron microscopy showed that floc was compact and energy-dispersive-x-ray analysis showed that guar gum was capable to adsorb multiple ions from the leachate. Structural characterization using Fourier Transform Infrared analysis demonstrated that hydrogen bonding between guar and pollutant particles was involved in coagulation and flocculation process. Therefore, guar gum coagulant present potential to be an alternative in leachate treatment where pH requirement is not required during treatment. Simultaneously, adsorption by guar gum offers added pollutant removal advantage.",

The carrier was found to be cytocompatible as revealed by MTT assay against MDA-MB-231 and HeLa cell lines and excellent blood compatibility till the concentration of 200 μg/ml. In addition to these, the carrier exhibited excellent gene binding capability and formed spherical shaped complexes. The carrier showed very high in vitro transfection efficiency in TNBC cell (MDA-MB-231) compared to lipofectamine 2000 (LF2k) which could be justified by its high buffering capacity.

The adsorption complies with the Freundlich model, indicating that it is a multilayered process with complex adsorption mechanisms. Considering their porous structure and nitrogen/phosphorus heteroatoms doping, the phosphate-adsorbed hydrogels are made into porous N,P doped carbon aerogels that can be potentially used as electrodes for a supercapacitor.

Improving health by beneficially modulating an altered microbiota is a promising treatment approach. Prebiotics, substrates selectively used by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit, are broadly used for dietary and clinical interventions. Herein, we sought to investigate the microbiota-modelling effects of the soluble fiber, partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG). (2) Methods: We performed a 9 week clinical trial in 20 healthy volunteers that included three weeks of a lead-in period, followed by three weeks of an intervention phase, wherein study subjects received 5 g PHGG up to three times per day, and concluding with a three-week washout period. A stool diary was kept on a daily basis, and clinical data along with serum/plasma and stool samples were collected on a weekly basis. PHGG-induced alterations of the gut microbiota were studied by 16S metagenomics of the V1-V3 and V3-V4 regions. To gain functional insight, we further studied stool metabolites using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. (3) Results: In healthy subjects, PHGG had significant effects on stool frequency and consistency. These effects were paralleled by changes in α- (species evenness) and β-diversity (Bray-Curtis distances), along with increasing abundances of metabolites including butyrate, acetate and various amino acids. On a taxonomic level, PHGG intake was associated with a bloom in Ruminococcus, Fusicatenibacter, Faecalibacterium and Bacteroides and a reduction in Roseburia, Lachnospiracea and Blautia. The majority of effects disappeared after stopping the prebiotic and most effects tended to be more pronounced in male participants.

The synthesized material was characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM-EDX, TEM, TGA-DTG, AFM, and UV-vis techniques. A combination of RSM and CCD was employed to compute the system and optimized values of various interacting parameters such as exposure time (120 min), pH (4.98), dye concentration (194 mg L-1), and catalyst dose (0.07 g) with a photodegradation capacity of 92.33% and desirability 1.0. The mechanism of degradation reaction was best elucidated by the pseudo-second-order model suggesting chemical deposition of MB on the GG-Alg@Ag surface through followed by the reduction mechanism in the occupancy of visible light.

However, low bioavailability and severe nephrotoxicity are among the major shortcomings of AmB-based therapy. Various AmB nanoformulations have been developed, which to an extent, have reduced its toxicity and increased the drug efficacy. To further reduce the nonspecific tissue distribution and the cost of the treatment, the current AmB-based formulations require additional improvements. Combination of natural bioenhancers with AmB is expected to further increase its bioavailability. Therefore, we developed a nanoformulation of AmB and piperine (Pip), a plant alkaloid, known to enhance the bioavailability of various drugs, by entrapping them in guar gum, a macrophage targeting polymer. Owing to the ease of oral delivery, these nanoparticles (NPs) were coated with eudragit to make them suitable for oral administration. The formulated eudragit-coated AmB and Pip-loaded NPs (Eu-HDGG-AmB-Pip-NPs) exhibited controlled release of the loaded therapeutic agents and protected the drug from acidic pH. These NPs exhibited effective suppression of growth of both promastigotes and amastigotes of Leishmania donovani parasite under in vitro. In vivo evaluation of these NPs for therapeutic efficacy in golden hamster-L. donovani model demonstrated enhanced drug bioavailability, non-nephrotoxic nature, and potential antileishmanial activity with up to 96% inhibition of the parasite.

The physicochemical properties of these NPs were analyzed with 1H NMR, TEM and DLS. The FITC-SiO2@Au-DOX-GGS-FA NPs exhibited the fluorescence and X-ray attenuation properties due to the presence of FITC-SiO2@Au hybrid nanostructure. Due to acid-cleavable hydrazone bond between the DOX and NPs, the quantity of DOX delivered from the FITC-SiO2@Au-DOX-GGS-FA NPs was increased at pH 5.6 than that at pH 7.4. Besides, the multi-functional NPs presented the improved cellular uptake by HeLa cells via FA-receptor-mediated endocytosis due to the existence of FA. The developed NPs also presented the improved cytotoxicity towards the HeLa cells due to its tumor-targetability and DOX/photothermal effect. These results suggested that the FITC-SiO2@Au-DOX-GGS-FA NPs could be ideal for computed tomography (CT)/fluorescence dual imaging and combined chemo/photothermal therapy (PTT) of cancer.",

The injection of d-galactose can cause aging-related injury which is usually resulted from oxidative stress on tissues and cells. In this study, d-galactose (200 mg/kg/day) was injected into rats, and the protective effects of PHGG (500, 1000, and 1500 mg/kg/day) against oxidative damages, as well as its probiotic functions, were analyzed. The results showed that PHGG treatment at a concentration of 1500 mg/kg/day greatly reduced the levels of lactic acid, nitric oxide, inducible nitric oxide synthase, advanced glycation end products, and increased the telomerase activity, by 7.60%, 9.25%, 12.28%, 14.58%, and 9.01%, respectively. Moreover, PHGG significantly elevated the activities of antioxidant enzymes and decreased the content of malondialdehyde in rat serum and brain. The oxidative damage was also significantly alleviated in the liver and hippocampus and the expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and choline acetyltransferase also increased. Furthermore, PHGG treatment could significantly regulated the expression of sirtuin 1, forkhead box O1, and tumor protein p53 in the hippocampus. It also increased the levels of organic acids and improved the composition of intestinal microbiota. These findings demonstrated that PHGG treatment could effectively alleviate the oxidative damage and dysbacteriosis.",

Structural characterization showed that aldehydes guar gum was grafted with salicylhydrazine with morphology. The as-prepared nanocomposite had a large surface area and hydrophobicity, which ensured its good sorption ability and convenience of separation. The sorption equilibrium data were well fitted to the Langmuir model, and uniquely high adsorption capacities for nickel, chromium and cobalt, which are 1272.4 mg•g-1, 748.86 mg•g-1 and 521.81 mg•g-1, remarkably, were achieved. The thermodynamic parameters for the sorption were also determined, and ΔG and ΔH values indicate exothermic behavior. Adsorption mechanism of capturing cation with GG-SH has been demonstrated through 1H NMR titration experiments of model molecular and metal ions. The features make this carbohydrate-based material suitable in water purification and separation treatment."

Mice were treated with galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS) and xylo-oligosaccharide (XOS) at a dose of 1 g/kg bw as positive controls. Low- and high-dose HHGG and MHGG groups received 250 mg or 1 g/kg bw, respectively. Treatment was administered intragastrically for 15 days, and constipation model was induced by loperamide lavage at d 16. PHGG could increase fecal moisture and small intestinal transit and shortened the time to first black stool defecation after constipation. The highest short-chain fatty acid production was observed in the high-dose MHGG group. Additionally, PHGG, GOS, and XOS predominantly promoted the accumulation of Bacteroidetes and inhibited the growth of Desulfovibrio. This study suggested that MHGG treatment could elicit constipation relief in mice. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In this study, partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) produced by mannanase hydrolysis was applied for the relieving constipation in mice. The medium-molecular-weight product (Mw 2,000-10,000 Da) could elicit constipation relief and modulate the gut microbiota in mice, which shows the potential to act as dietary fiber for constipation treatment.",

      "abstract": "Natural polysaccharides, particularly galactomannans, are potential candidates for treatment of alcoholic liver diseases (ALD). However, applications are restricted due to the physicochemical properties associated with the high molecular weight. In this work, guar gum galactomannans were partially hydrolyzed by β-mannanase, and the molecular mechanisms of hepatoprotective effects were elucidated both in vitro and in vivo. Release of lactate dehydrogenase and cytochrome C were attenuated by partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) in HepG2 cells, due to protected cell and mitochondrial membrane integrity. PHGG co-administration decreased serum amino transaminases and cholinesterase levels of acute alcohol intoxicated mice, while hepatic pathologic morphology was depleted. Activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase was recovered to 198.2, 34.5, 236.0 U/mg protein, respectively, while malondialdehyde level was decreased by 76.3% (PHGG, 1000 mg/kg∙day). Co-administration of PHGG induced a 4.4-fold increment of p-AMPK expression, and lipid metabolism was mediated. PHGG alleviated toll-like-receptor-4-mediated inflammation via the signaling cascade of MyD88 and IκBα, decreasing cytokine production. Moreover, mediated expression of Bcl-2 and Bax was responsible for inhibited acute alcohol-induced apoptosis with suppressed cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP. Findings gained suggest that PHGG can be used as functional food supplement for the treatment of acute alcohol-induced liver injury.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal therapeutic approach towards colorectal cancer (CRC) holds great promise. There is, however, no convincing strategy reported to date that employs a multimodal strategy in CRC treatment. The present study reports an intense green-emitting core-shell photoluminescent upconversion (CSGU) nanocrystal engineered to synergistically perform photodynamic and enzyme-triggered delivery of the chemotherapeutic agent for an enhanced therapeutic outcome on HT-29 colon carcinoma cells in vitro. The photodynamic activity is achieved by the energy transfer between CSGU and the chemically conjugated Rose Bengal (RB) molecules that are further protected by a mesoporous silica (MS) layer. The chemical assay demonstrates a remarkable FRET mediated generation of 1O2 under NIR (980 nm) excitation. The outermost MS layer of the nanoplatform is utilized for the loading of the 5FU anticancer drug, which is further capped with a guar gum (GG) polysaccharide polymer. The release of the 5FU is specifically triggered by the degradation of the GG cap by specific enzymes secreted from colonic microflora, which otherwise showed 'zero-release behavior' in the absence of any enzymatic trigger in various simulated gastro-intestinal (GI) conditions. Furthermore, the enhanced therapeutic efficacy of the nanoplatform (CSGUR-MSGG/5FU) was evaluated through in vitro studies using HT-29 CRC cell lines by various biochemical and microscopic assays by the simultaneous triggering effect of colonic enzyme and 980 nm laser excitation. In addition, the strong visible emission from the nanoplatform has been utilized for NIR-induced cellular bioimaging.",

Enhanced surface wettability was witnessed post-plasma treatment. AFM analyses revealed the topographical changes of the hydrogels at the nano-scale level without any adverse effect on their bulk physical structure. The hydrogels exhibited pH-responsive swelling with maximum swelling in neutral pH. The release of diclofenac sodium from the hydrogels confirmed their potential towards colon-targeted drug delivery. Excellent biofilm eradication features against E. coli was demonstrated by the hydrogels. Hemolytic assay on human RBCs affirmed their hemocompatibility. Moreover, the hydrogels were found to be remarkably biodegradable. Thus, non-thermal plasma assisted surface nano-textured CMGG/CS hydrogels can be efficaciously explored for their diverse applications in biomedicine."

Our aim was to evaluate, in type 2 diabetes, the acute effects of low dose \"preloads\" of whey and guar, given alone or in combination before a meal, on postprandial glycemia, insulin, GLP-1, and gastric emptying. METHODS: 21 patients with type 2 diabetes, managed by diet or metformin alone, were each studied on 4 days. They received a preload \"shake\" 15min before a mashed potato meal (368.5 kcal) labeled with 13C-octanoic-acid. The preloads comprised either (i) 17 g whey (W), (ii) 5 g guar (G), (iii) 17 g whey + 5 g guar (WG) each sweetened with 60 mg sucralose, and (iv) 60 mg sucralose alone (control; C), all dissolved in 150 mL water. Venous blood was sampled frequently for measurements of glucose, insulin, and GLP-1 concentrations. Gastric half-emptying time (T50) was calculated from breath 13CO2 excretion over 240 min. RESULTS: Postprandial blood glucose concentrations were lower with W and WG compared to C (each P < 0.0001, treatment × time interaction), and lower after G than C only at 30min. Insulin, GLP-1, and glucagon concentrations were higher after W than WG, G, or C (P < 0.05, treatment × time interaction), without differences between the latter three. Gastric emptying was slower with W (T50: 179.6 ± 6.1 min, P < 0.05) and WG (T50: 197.6 ± 9.7 min, P < 0.0001) when compared to C (T50: 162.9 ± 6.2 min), but did not differ between G (T50: 171.3 ± 7.0) and C (P > 0.99). CONCLUSION: Both whey and whey/guar preloads reduced postprandial glycemia, associated with slowing of gastric emptying. Low dose guar was less effective as a preload for glucose-lowering and did not slow gastric emptying.

Guar gum, a natural polymer was used as binders in pharmaceutical formulations, and acts as a reducing and capping agent for the synthesis of zero valent iron nanoparticles (ZVI). The physicochemical properties of the ZGNC were characterized by TGA, FTIR, XRD, FESEM, EDS, HRTEM, DLS and XPS. The average particle size was ∼60-70 nm and the guar gum polymer on the ZVI were clearly visible from HRTEM. The XPS of ZGNC clearly confirms the elemental composition of the ZVI, guar gum and FeO. The 0.5 g/L ZGNC when used for the pollutants treatment, 15 ppm ciprofloxacin was adsorbed with a removal efficiency of 94% in 60 min at pH 4.0 whereas it had exhibited catalytic oxidation for 100 ppm methyl orange with an efficiency of 99% in 60 min at pH 7.0."
