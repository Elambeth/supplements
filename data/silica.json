      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial photodynamic, sonodynamic, and combined photodynamic and sonodynamic potentials of IR780 iodide loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles against gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and multi drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR P. aeruginosa). METHODS: IR780 iodide loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were synthesized, and their antimicrobial photodynamic and sonodynamic potentials against one P. aeruginosa strain, and one MDR P. aeruginosa strain were investigated. Laser irradiation was achieved via a 785 nm diode laser (500 mW/cm2, 5 min). Ultrasound irradiation was achieved via a 1-MHz ultrasound unit (1.5 W/cm2, 50% duty cycle, 3 min). Viable bacterial cells were counted by serial dilution method. Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Tukey's test (p ≤ 0.05). RESULTS: The results revealed that for P. aeruginosa, the combined photodynamic therapy (PDT) and sonodynamic therapy (SDT) showed a 44% reduction in bacterial cell viability as compared to 18% and 31% when exposed to SDT alone and PDT alone, respectively. For MDR. P. aeruginosa, the combined treatment resulted in a 45% reduction in bacterial cell viability, as compared to 14% and 30% when exposed to SDT alone and PDT alone, respectively. The killing effect was mainly due to the photodynamic and sonodynamic effects of the nanoparticles, mainly caused by singlet oxygen. No photothermal effect was involved in the killing. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated that IR780 iodide-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles have the potential to be utilized as photo/sono therapeutic agents for the inactivation of drug-resistant bacteria.",

      "abstract": "Activation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway could effectively initiate antitumor immunity in triple-negative breast cancer. However, current nuclear DNA-mediated activation of STING pathway remains constrained by the tight protection of nuclear membrane and histones, highlighting the need for new strategies to enhance its efficacy. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), in contrast, is more vulnerable to damage. Herein, our nanoplatforms exploited the high glutathione (GSH) environment characteristic of tumors to release abundant Mn2+, which induced mitochondrial dysfunction and the release of endogenous mtDNA. The released mtDNA, in conjunction with Mn2+ itself functioning as a strong cGAS agonist, effectively activated cGAS-STING pathway. Consequently, the cGAS-STING-dependent secretion of type I interferon successively enhanced the maturation of dendritic cells and cross-priming of CD8+ T cells. In a poorly immunogenic 4T1 tumor model, TPP-MMONs efficiently primed systemic antitumor immunity and significantly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of αPD-L1 therapy, suppressing tumor growth in both localized and metastatic tumor models. These findings provided an innovative and straightforward strategy to enhance TNBC immunogenicity by targeting mitochondrial damage to induce mtDNA-mediated cGAS-STING activation, thereby sensitizing tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The cGAS-STING pathway is a promising target for overcoming immunoresistance in TNBC. However, current nuclear DNA-based activation strategies are limited by the tight protection of nuclear membrane and histones. Herein, we reported novel manganese-rich, mitochondria-targeting nanoplatforms (TPP-MMONs), which can release abundant Mn²⁺ and significantly induce mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to the release of mtDNA. As a result, the nanoplatforms can effectively stimulate the cGAS-STING pathway, thereby enhancing immune responses and improving the therapeutic efficacy of αPD-L1 therapy, offering new insights into TNBC treatments."

      "abstract": "Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is widely employed due to its high sensitivity and distinctive fingerprinting capabilities. Colloidal nanoaggregates are commonly used as SERS substrates because of their mobility and the abundance of \"hotspots\". Although the reagent-free \"freeze-thaw-ultrasonication\" method for preparing Ag nanoaggregates (AgNAs) does not introduce additional background interference and maintains the original interfacial properties of AgNAs, their unstable physical nanostructure limits SERS detection to just 7 days. Herein, we demonstrate mesoporous silica-encapsulated colloidal Ag nanoaggregates (AgNAs@m-SiO2) by combining a freeze-thaw-ultrasonication method and a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-assisted silanization reaction, achieving long-term SERS stability of more than two months. The prepared AgNAs@m-SiO2 serve a dual capability: (1) preserving electromagnetic \"hotspots\" for ultra-sensitive detection (e.g., malachite green detection limit: 3.60 × 10-8 M), and (2) maintaining structural stability under harsh conditions. The AgNAs@m-SiO2 substrate exhibited superior structural stability after 50 min of ultrasonic treatment, with an initial SERS signal retention of 91.8%, which is twice that of the bare AgNAs (retention of 45%). The long-term performance further highlighted its superiority: after 70 days of storage, the composite maintained 84.3% of its original signal strength, outperforming the uncoated controls by over ten times (which retained only 8%). Crucially, the substrate's robust design enables the direct detection of contaminants in real environmental matrices (river and seawater) for qualitative analyses and water quality assessments, thus validating its suitability for environmental sensing applications in the field."

      "abstract": "Fumed silica, a nanomaterial with a high specific surface area, excellent chemical stability, and electrical insulation, serves as an effective filler for rubber compounding. Compared to traditional carbon black, silica (SiO2), the main component of fumed silica, improves the hardness and tear resistance of tread rubber, making it a viable substitute in some formulations. However, silica-filled compounds generally exhibit lower tensile properties and abrasion resistance than carbon black. Fumed silica, with its higher structural integrity, provides additional reinforcement points within natural rubber matrices, enhancing tensile strength and abrasion resistance. Studies demonstrate that replacing carbon black with an equivalent amount of fumed silica as the primary filler significantly improves tread rubber's hardness (by 20%) and 300% tensile modulus (by 14%) while also reducing rolling resistance and enhancing wet skid performance. Fumed silica's large specific surface area and low density (10-15% of conventional silica) make it challenging to use directly as a tread rubber filler due to dust formation and prolonged mixing times. This study developed a process combining fumed silica with deionized water, followed by drying and ball milling. This treatment reduces the material's volume, forming a cohesive gel that, upon processing, minimizes dust and significantly decreases mixing time and difficulty. The interaction between the hydroxyl (-OH) groups on the surface of fumed silica and water molecules likely results in hydrated silica. This interaction enhances surface polarity and forms a hydration layer, improving the hydrophilicity and dispersion of fumed silica in rubber matrices. This reduces the shear modulus difference (ΔG') between low and high strain, maintaining a consistent elastic modulus over a wide strain range. Such stability enables rubber to perform better under dynamic loads or in complex working conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that the hydration-ball milling process enhances the tensile strength of vulcanizates, improves the dispersion of fumed silica in rubber, strengthens the filler network, boosts dynamic performance, and enhances the wet skid resistance of tread rubber."

      "abstract": "A novel hybrid adsorbent of activated carbon/maltodextrin-functionalized fibrous silica (AC/KCC-1/DEX) was prepared for the efficient removal of Acetaminophen (ACE) and Amoxicillin (AMOX) from water. Comprehensive characterization via FESEM, TEM, BET, XPS, and FTIR confirmed an enhances surface properties and functional corporation from supporting materials and functionalization agent. Particularly, despite significant decrease in surface area upon DEX functionalization, a remarkable enhancement in adsorption removal efficiency was observed, underscoring the pivotal role of surface chemistry over surface area alone. The AC/KCC-1/DEX exhibited 87.64 m2/g and 122.94 m2/g of micropore and mesopores surface area, respectively, along with reactive functional group of DEX such as -OH, which increase surface polarity and enables strong interactions with polar pharmaceuticals. This innovative material evinced high adsorption capacity of 87.97 mg/g and 77.31 mg/g for ACE and AMOX, respectively, achieving percentage removal of 94 % and 81 %, correspondingly. Adsorption kinetics were best described by the Elovich model, suggesting heterogenous surface interactions, while Redlich-Peterson isotherm favoured physisorption. Advanced statistical physics modelling with key steric parameters provided further mechanistic insights at a molecular level, revealing a multilayer physisorption mechanism with additional chemisorption contributions. Thermodynamic analysis supported the spontaneity and exothermic nature of the process, with negative Gibbs free energy (ΔG) and enthalpy (ΔH) values, while a negative entropy change (ΔS), proposed increased order at the solid-liquid interface, indicative of strong adsorbate-adsorbent affinity and potential chemisorption effects. This study not only demonstrates the effectiveness and adsorption behaviour of AC/KCC-1/DEX but also opens new avenues for sustainable water treatment solutions."

      "abstract": "While acute cardiovascular effects of silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) have been reported, the long-term impact of human-relevant exposure on cardiac hypertrophy remains unclear. The rats were randomly assigned to two groups: The SiNPs exposure group and the control group, receiving intratracheal instillations of SiNPs suspension or saline, respectively, once a week for six months (24 doses total). Both groups then underwent a six-month recovery period without further intervention to assess post-exposure effects. The results revealed significant hypertrophic remodeling, as evidenced by increased left ventricular anterior wall thickness (LVAWd), systolic dysfunction (reduced FS%), and diastolic impairment (prolonged LVRT and LVCT). Ultrastructural analysis indicated mitochondrial disorganization and swelling in myocardial tissue. At the molecular level, SiNPs exposure upregulated hypertrophic markers (β-MHC, ANP), inflammatory cytokines (IL-18, IL-1β), and oxidative stress markers MDA, while reducing SOD levels. Both classical (Caspase-1) and non-classical (Caspase-4, Caspase-5) pyroptosis pathways were activated, with elevated levels of Cleaved-Caspase-1, ASC and N-GSDMD. This study is the first to identify non-classical pyroptosis as a contributor to SiNPs-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Importantly, cardiac hypertrophy was significantly reduced after exposure cessation, with no further pyroptosis-mediated inflammatory damage observed. These findings underscore the importance of stricter public health regulations to limit SiNPs exposure, given its long-term cardiovascular risks."

      "abstract": "Silicosis is a fibrotic disease caused by prolonged inhalation of silica particles. Signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) and its ligand CD47, key innate immune checkpoints mediating inhibition of phagocytosis, have been reported to regulate organ fibrosis. However, the role of SIRPα/CD47 in silicosis remains unexplored. In this study, a silicosis mouse model was constructed and revealed a significant upregulation of SIRPα and CD47 expression in lung tissue with disease progression. In addition, the expression patterns of SIRPα and CD47 in various silicosis effector cells exhibit distinct cell specificity. Using RRx-001 to block SIRPα/CD47 signaling in mice, we observed a marked reduction in lung injury, decreased collagen deposition, and improved pulmonary function. Mechanistically, blocking SIRPα/CD47 affected T cell activation, macrophage polarization and the expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic factors. In vitro, we found that inhibiting SIRPα/CD47 countered the silica-induced suppression of macrophage phagocytosis and induced macrophage polarization towards the M1 phenotype. Additionally, levels of soluble SIRPα and CD47 in the peripheral blood of silicosis patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls. In summary, this study demonstrates that SIRPα/CD47-mediated immunomodulatory signaling is the driving factor for the progression of silicosis, and this pathway might serve as a therapeutic target for silicosis treatment."

Healthcare workers have constantly faced a challenge in constructing an effective sustained-release system for drugs, especially in areas where it is difficult to follow traditional treatment guidelines. To achieve a dual sustained release of vancomycin and cell growth factors, we designed a composite hydrogel, which was polymerized under ultraviolet irradiation to form a methacrylate gelatin (GelMA)/polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) cross-linked system. The hydrogel showed antibacterial and pro-osteogenic differentiation activities by blending it with vancomycin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-loaded silica particles. The experimental results showed that with increased PEGDA concentration, the hydrogels were degraded by swelling with a longer sustained release time. After 144-h immersion, the hydrogel still showed sustained release of IGF-1. The antibacterial experiment showed that the hydrogel pair had an obvious antibacterial effect against S. aureus. The results of live/dead staining and Cell Counting kit-8 assay indicated excellent biocompatibility of the hydrogel. Alizarin Red staining (ARS) further demonstrated that this hydrogel could induce bone marrow stem cells to initiate osteogenic differentiation. This hydrogel material exhibited excellent antibacterial and pro-osteogenic differentiation properties and might be promising for chronic osteomyelitis treatment.",

Cadmium (Cd) contamination in aqueous environments poses a significant threat to human health and ecosystem integrity because of its toxic and nonbiodegradable nature. AIM: The current study aimed to understand the antibacterial activity of green synthesized and surface-modified silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with silica and dopamine (DA) for efficient Cd removal from aqueous solutions. METHODS: A green and ecofriendly nanosorbent, AgNPs@TEOS@DA, was synthesized to study its antibacterial activity and efficient removal of Cd (II) ions from aqueous solutions. The nanosorbent synthesis process adheres to green chemistry principles, utilizing biologically derived reducing agents. AgNPs@TEOS@DA exhibit a uniform spherical morphology, providing a high surface area for interactions with target Cd (II) ions. RESULTS: SP nanoparticles exhibited the highest inhibition zones for various bacteria and were most effective. The study established a 15-minutes incubation time as optimal for rapid and consistent Cd (II) ion absorption. The adsorption efficiency was pH-dependent, with the maximum absorption observed at a pH of approximately 6.0. The concentration-dependent adsorption behavior was also observed in accordance with the established adsorption kinetics. The environmentally friendly synthesis process and efficient Cd (II) ion removal capability of AgNPs@TEOS@DA make them promising candidates for addressing environmental and water quality challenges. This study contributes to the advancement of ecofriendly materials for heavy metal removal while supporting sustainable and environmentally conscious practices. CONCLUSION: This study paves the way for the utilization of ecofriendly materials for heavy metal removal, fostering a more sustainable and environmentally conscious approach to wastewater treatment.",

The development of nanosystems with well-defined compartments to house and sequentially deliver different antimicrobial agents was carried out. A relatively simple and direct straightforward approach was carried out, consisting of loading MSNs with levofloxacin (LVX) by an impregnation method followed by external coating with a gelatin shell embedding a mixture of N-acetylcysteine (AC) plus LVX. Thus, the release of the mucolytic agent, AC, at the earliest stage causes disaggregation of the outer mucopolysaccharide layer of the mature E. coli biofilm, as confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy studies. This biofilm disruption effect facilitates the antimicrobial action of LVX, which is released in a more sustained manner over longer periods of time than AC, achieving a remarkable reduction (ca. 99.8%) of mature E. coli biofilms. These results are supported by the combined effect of AC and LVX strategically combined in the same nanocarrier. Preliminary in vitro studies with preosteoblastic cells point to the good biocompatibility of these nanosystems."

A beta-blocker, Carvedilol (CRV) has recently been reported as an off-label option for the management of cardiovascular disorders in pediatric patients. CRV exhibits a pH-dependent solubility and undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, resulting in low oral bioavailability. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) of two types (MCM-41 and SBA-15) were loaded with CRV at three saturation levels to improve its dissolution rate. At high saturation level, CRV-loaded SBA-15 showed superior dissolution with a dissolution efficiency of 72.42 % and significant dissimilarity (f1 = 211.80, f2 = 16.89) compared to pure CRV, demonstrating enhanced solubility and dissolution rate due to its amorphous transformation and large pore diameter. Thermal and diffractometry analysis revealed the adsorption of CRV to MSNs in an amorphous state. CRV-loaded SBA-15 was incorporated into gel bases, and the amount of CRV released from triple-layer loaded gels was found to be higher than monolayer-loaded formulations. The ex vivo skin permeation study revealed a significant enhancement of drug release and permeation for CRV-loaded SBA-15 gel formulations (714.49 ± 38.49 µg/cm2) after 24 h, compared to the control (236.19 ± 18.93 µg/cm2), with flux increased by 62 %. Improving pediatric compliance by providing a convenient, non-invasive, and palatable drug delivery option that minimizes dosing errors and enhances treatment adherence. Our study suggests CRV-loaded SBA-15 transdermal gel as a pediatric-friendly alternative to oral delivery, addressing bitter taste, bypassing hepatic metabolism, and improving bioavailability while reducing side effects."

Furthermore, VC/GT@HA-SS-HMS demonstrated superior synergistic cytotoxicity and apoptotic rates relative to VC or GT-loaded HA-SS-HMS and the free VC/GT combination against the PANC- 1 cell line. The biochemical staining outcomes indicated a significant change in apoptosis ratio in cells treated with VC/GT@HA-SS-HMS. Collectively, our research demonstrates the promise of HA-SS-HMS as an effective nanoparticle-based approach for targeted and induced codelivery of VC/GT combination in the treatment of pancreatic cancer cells."

      "abstract": "Malignant melanoma presents a significant challenge in oncology due to its aggressive nature and high metastatic potential. Conventional systemic treatments often fail to effectively reach tumor sites, limiting their therapeutic impact. This study introduces a groundbreaking triple-strategy approach for treating malignant melanoma. A novel prodrug, an oligonucleotide, comprising 10 units of Floxuridine (5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine) (FdU) nucleoside antimetabolites are developed, to enhance half-life and reduce rapid metabolism. Encapsulated in soluble colloidal silica nanoparticles, this compound is protected and directed toward tumor neovasculature precursor endothelial cell receptors, ensuring local delivery. The strategy focuses on releasing the prodrug in the tumor microenvironment, aiming to eradicate both melanoma cells and their supportive structures. Efficacy is demonstrated in cell culture studies and preclinical models of malignant melanoma, showing a remarkable 50% reduction in tumor size after just three intravenous treatments. These findings underscore the transformative potential of targeting endothelial cell membrane proteins for drug delivery. This study paves the way for innovative targeted therapies, promising significant advancements in treatment strategies and improves outcomes for patients with metastatic cancers."

This study introduces an acidity-responsive magnetite nanoparticle-based nanocarrier for effective breast cancer treatment. The magnetite nanoparticles were initially coated with [3-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)-propyl]-trimethoxysilane, an epoxysilane cross-linker, to enhance their stability and functional properties. Subsequently, NH2-PEG-COOH was conjugated to epoxy-functionalized silica-coated magnetite nanoparticles to improve biocompatibility and introduce reactive carboxyl groups. These carboxyl groups were further modified with hydrazine via carbodiimide-mediated amidation to construct magnetic nanocarriers (MNC). DOX was loaded into the system via acid-sensitive hydrazone bonds, resulting in the final MNC-DOX formulation. The DOX loading process followed the Ho-McKay model, demonstrating chemical adsorption kinetics with a high loading capacity of 433.147 mg/g. The acid-sensitive hydrazone bond facilitated rapid DOX release in response to the acidic tumor microenvironment, with release kinetics following the Korsmeyer-Peppas model, indicative of Fickian diffusion. In vitro cytotoxicity assays revealed that MNC-DOX exhibited significant cytotoxicity against MCF-7 breast cancer cells. This novel MNC-DOX formulation holds great potential for enhancing cancer therapy, highlighting its responsiveness to subtle pH changes and its ability to improve the targeted delivery and controlled release of chemotherapeutic agents."

To address this, Levetiracetam (LVM) has emerged as effective treatment option due to minimal negative interactions with other medications and reduced side-effects. However, its hydrophilic nature necessitates high doses and frequent administration, which can lead to drug resistance and hinder the clinical response to therapy. The present research focuses on developing a novel formulation of LVM-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (LVM-MSN) conjugated with Apolipoprotein E3 (ApoE3) for enhanced brain-targeting. LVM-MSN were prepared using the calcination method after optimizing different synthesis parameters. Chitosan was employed as capping agent to form LVM-Chito-MSN, which was characterized using zeta potential, XRD, FE-SEM, and TEM study. Further, LVM-Chito-MSN was functionalized by ApoE3 as brain-targeting ligand through direct coating approach (ApoE3@LVM-Chito-MSN). In-vivo pharmacokinetic study and biodistribution study indicated an impressive 3-fold increase in brain-uptake of ApoE3@LVM-Chito-MSN, with reduced distribution to other organs compared to LVM solution. The hemolysis study and histological examination of major organs indicated safety of the formulation. Consequently, functionalization of MSN with ApoE3 represents promising strategy for enhanced brain targeting, which could lead to improved patient compliance and better overall survival rates for patients suffering from brain tumor-related epilepsy."

Lung microbiota is closely associated with chronic respiratory diseases, particularly pulmonary fibrosis. However, the role of lung microbiota in the progression of silicosis remains inadequately explored. This study established a model of C57BL/6 J mice exposed to silica via inhalation through intratracheal drip, while the lung microbiota was modified using antibiotics via intratracheal drip. Silica exposure induced dysbiosis of the lung microbiota and the triggered cellular senescence. Transcriptomic analysis of lung tissue revealed enrichment of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Mechanistically, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produced by lung microbiota drives cellular senescence, which plays a key role in pulmonary fibrosis, as demonstrated by LPS stimulation and indirect co-culture experiments. In conclusion, silica affects the progression of pulmonary fibrosis by altering the composition of lung microbiota, leading to increased LPS production, which promotes senescence of type Ⅱ alveolar epithelial cells (ATⅡ) through activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. This study provides novel insights and rationale for targeted intervention aimed at mitigating ATⅡ senescence to counteract silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, due to the lack of typical symptoms and specific diagnostic biomarkers, silicotic patients often having already developed pulmonary fibrosis by the time of clinical diagnosis. Studies have demonstrated that human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (hucMSC-EVs) could moderate silicosis fibrosis, which may be related to the microRNAs (miRNAs) in hucMSC-EVs. While the full extent of their antifibrotic effects and the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. METHODS: HucMSC-EVs were administered from day 28 to day 56 after silica exposure in mice, which in a therapeutic manner. In addition, the antifibrotic abilities of engineered hucMSC-EVs with varying levels of miR-148a-3p, a miRNA with antifibrotic properties, were evaluated. Heat shock protein 90 beta family member 1 (Hsp90b1) is reported to be a target of miR-148a-3p, the protein-protein interaction analysis was used to explore its regulated downstream factors in lung fibrosis. The underlying mechanisms were also investigated by using miR-148a-3p mimics and small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Hsp90b1 in vitro. RESULTS: HucMSC-EVs could reduce the histopathological changes and the levels of fibrotic proteins in the mouse lung tissues when administered in a therapeutic manner. Meanwhile, miR-148a-3p-overexpressed hucMSC-EVs intervention exhibited the enhanced anti-fibrotic effect compared with the negative control intervention group. In vitro, the elevated level of miR-148a-3p in hucMSC-EVs was shown to enhance hucMSC-EVs' inhibition of fibroblast collagen hypersecretion, whereas a depressed level of miR-148a-3p in hucMSC-EVs partially counteracted the inhibitory effect. Moreover, the mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-148a-3p could blunt β-catenin signaling via targeting Hsp90b1 in fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that hucMSC-EVs retain their antifibrotic properties in silicotic mice when administered in a therapeutic manner. Further, miR-148a-3p was confirmed to be an essential component within hucMSC-EVs, mediating their inhibition of silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis by reducing β-catenin signaling via targeting of Hsp90b1 in fibroblasts.",

This article overviews the various factors involved in the development of MDR, such as changes in drug targets, increased DNA repair mechanisms, and the impact of the tumor microenvironment. It also emphasizes the potential of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) as a drug delivery system to combat MDR. With their unique characteristics-such as a high surface area, adjustable pore sizes, and the ability to be functionalized for targeted delivery-MSNs serve as excellent carriers for the simultaneous delivery of chemotherapeutics and siRNAs aimed at reversing resistance pathways. The paper focuses on innovative methods using MSNs for direct intranuclear delivery of their cargos to overcome efflux barrier and improve the effectiveness of combination therapies. This review highlights a promising approach for enhancing cancer treatment outcomes by integrating advanced nanotechnology with traditional therapies, addressing the ongoing challenge of MDR in oncology.",

Environmental SiNPs have attracted attention owing to their exposure to various cardiovascular adverse events. Here, we exposed C57/BL6 mouse and HL-1 cells with different-sized SiNPs (50, 300 nm, and 1 μm) to investigate the underlying mechanism of its cardiovascular toxicity. Mice exposed to three-sized SiNPs showed significant weight loss after 21 days of treatment. Heart weight to tibia length ratio and histopathology staining indicated increased heart volume and cross-sectional area of myocardial fibers in mice exposed to SiNPs. In vivo and in vitro experiments results showed that exposure to SiNPs causes size-dependent mitochondrial damage and initiates mitophagy. Notably, compared to the damage caused by 300 nm and 1 μm SiNPs exposure, 50 nm SiNPs blocked autophagy flux, leading to excessive accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the cytoplasm, ultimately exacerbating downstream cGAS-STING pathway-mediated pyroptosis. This study revealed the potential health risks of SiNPs and helped to understand the differences in cytotoxicity caused by SiNPs of different sizes.",

The effectiveness of current drug treatment for NP is still unsatisfactory due to its side effects, addiction and withdrawal. In recent years, researchers have begun to develop nano-drug delivery systems for the diagnosis and treatment of NP diseases. METHODS: We developed a disulfide-bonded magnetic mesoporous silica dual-drug delivery system consisting of curcumin (Cur) and a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist (CGRPi), and characterized by electron microscopy, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Zeta, specific surface area and pore size detection. At the cellular level, the biocompatibility of CGRPi@Cur@Fe3O4@mSiO2-PEG (FMCC) nanoparticles were tested by CCK-8 and dead/alive staining kit in BV2 cells; Inflammation levels and oxidative stress were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV2 neuroinflammation model. In vivo, chronic constriction injury (CCI) model was constructed, and the effect of FMCC on pain behavior of CCI mice was detected by von Frey filaments test and thermal hyperalgesia; The effects of FMCC on the anti-inflammatory and oxidative stress of CCI were determined by pathological tests (HE and ROS staining), RT-PCR and ELISA. RESULTS: FMCC had good biocompatibility and could be taken up by BV2 cells. At the cellular level, FMCC could effectively reverse oxidative stress, inflammation and CGRP expression in LPS-induced neuroinflammation model in vitro. At the animal level, the mice with CCI were administered with FMCC, which effectively reduced oxidative stress and inflammation and sustained relief of neuropathic pain. CONCLUSION: This study provides a new approach for the treatment of neuropathic pain."

This risk is particularly serious when facing emergency surgeries where rapid restoration of normal platelet function is required. Timely reversal of the effects of antiplatelet agents becomes crucial in such scenarios. Despite the widespread use of clopidogrel and prasugrel for their potent antiplatelet activity, the absence of specific and effective reversal agents remains a notable challenge. The pharmacological activity of clopidogrel and prasugrel is mediated by sulfhydryl-containing active metabolites, which form disulfide bonds with P2Y12 receptors on the surface of platelets to inhibit their aggregation. Taking advantage of this action mechanism of these \"irreversible\" antiplatelet drugs, click chemistry-functionalized mesoporous silica (SiO2-Mal) nanotraps are fabricated to capture the antiplatelet drugs' active metabolites and restore hemostasis. Subsequently, a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness and safety of the SiO2-Mal nanotraps is conducted using mouse, rabbit, and pig animal models, highlighting their potential application as a functional reversal agent for clinically relevant thienopyridine antiplatelet drugs, believed until now to be irreversible in their inhibition of platelet activity."

Adding small amounts of different antibiotics to the cement can help prevent and treat infections. Rifampin antibiotic has been added to bone cement to create an appropriate antimicrobial response in the treatment of resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) biofilms, but there are some challenges such as reducing mechanical properties and prolonging the setting time of the cement. Loading the antibiotic in the nanoparticle could eliminate these challenges. METHODS: In this study, rifampin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were added to bone cement, and the polymerization components, mechanical properties, drug release, antibacterial activity, and cellular response were investigated and compared with commercial pure cement and the cement containing free rifampin. RESULTS: Loading rifampin into MSN improved compressive strength by 57.52%. Cement containing rifampin loaded into MSN showed remarkable success in antibacterial activity. The growth inhibition zone created by it in the culture medium of Staphylococcus aureus and CoNS was 15.44% and 11.8% greater, respectively, than in the cement containing free rifampin. In other words, according to the results of spectrophotometric analysis of cement samples over 5 weeks, MSNs caused a 33.2 ± 0.21-fold increase in rifampin washout from the cement. Cellular examination of the cement containing rifampin loaded into MSN compared to commercial pure cement showed an acceptable level of cell viability. CONCLUSION: Rifampin loading in MSN limited the reduction of cement strength. It also improved the drug release pattern and prevented antibiotic resistance."

In this study, through applied MW irradiation, monodisperse, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanocrystals (IONCs) with thin, amorphous silica coatings are demonstrated to rapidly catalyze the degradation of organic compounds in water through a thermally enhanced, Fenton-type process. For this, we precisely synthesize amorphous silica-coated various metal oxide (single domain) nanocrystals, and then evaluate the degradation of methyl orange (MO) and benzoic acid (BA), chosen as model organic molecules. We examine (and optimize) the effects of core (nanocrystal) composition, size, and concentration, along with solution pH and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration. Further, we describe the catalytic degradation of BA with IONCs under MW irradiation through radical scavenger controls and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis, which support the proposed reaction mechanism. For materials evaluated, the amorphous silica coating not only prevents the loss of nanocrystal integrity but also provides a reactive, yet stable, interface between nanocrystals and bulk solutions, where the degradation of organic compounds can occur. Synthesized IONCs show high performance, which is repeatable for over five cycles without any deterioration of the nanocrystals core or metal leaching. Taken together, this research highlights the potential of enhanced MW-enhanced oxidation processes appropriately coated (i.e., designed) MW absorbers (here as superparamagnetic IONCs) for advanced water treatment."

Here, we present a novel warfarin adsorbent based on mesoporous silica that could serve as an antidote to warfarin toxicity. METHODS: Amino-functionalized mesoporous silica (MS-NH2) was synthesized based on the co-condensation method through a soft template technique followed by template removal. The prepared structure and functional group were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) checked the morphology. The capacity of MS-NH2 in the adsorption of warfarin was evaluated in vitro, at pH=7.4 and pH=1.2. In vivo evaluations were performed in control and warfarin-overdosed animal models. Overdosed animals were treated with MS-NH2 by oral gavage. Biomarkers of organ injury were assessed in animal serum. RESULTS: The MS-NH2 was relatively uniform, spherical with defined diameters (400 nm) and porous structure. Synthesized particles had a large surface area (1015 m2 g-1) and mean pore diameter of 2.4 nm which led to considerable adsorption capacity for warfarin 1666 mg/g. In vivo studies revealed that oral administration of MS-NH2 in mice poisoned with warfarin caused a significant difference (P<0.05) in the International Normalized Ratio (INR) and prothrombin time (PT). Moreover, the warfarin with MS-NH2 group demonstrated a notable decrease in biomarkers associated with tissue damage, such as bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). CONCLUSION: The results confirm that MS-NH2 administration can be an effective treatment for warfarin toxicity and could potentially mitigate the adverse effects of warfarin poisoning."

      "abstract": "The development of nanocarriers for pharmaceutical applications is a challenging research field as they have to fulfil several requirements, such as suitable physicochemical properties, biocompatibility, loading capacity for therapeutic agents, high stability in the bloodstream, and specific delivery to the target cells. This task becomes even more difficult when trying to transport two different therapeutic agents simultaneously, as is required by most of the current therapeutic strategies. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) fulfil most of these requirements, although they partially fail in the last two. However, these weaknesses can be circumvented if they are combined with another type of material such as polymers. In this context, the main goal of this research work was to develop MSN-based nanocarriers capable to co-transport drugs and nucleic acids and to specifically deliver them in liver cancer cells. To this end, we have prepared MSNs coated with lactobionic acid-based copolymers, as lactobionic acid has a high binding affinity to asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPR), which are overexpressed in liver cells. The designed hybrid MSN-based nanocarriers exhibited appropriate physicochemical properties, high ASGPR specificity and high biological activity. These MSN-glycopolymer hybrid nanosystems showed a 280-fold higher transfection activity in liver cancer cells than bare MSN particles. Furthermore, we demonstrated the ability of these nanosystems to efficiently mediate a combined antitumor strategy involving HSV-TK/GCV suicide gene therapy and chemotherapy (epirubicin), in liver cancer cells. Overall, the data obtained showed the great potential of this MSN-based nanoplatform to be applied in combined therapeutic strategies for the treatment of liver cancer.",

The pathological complexity of IBD frequently involves multiple factors such as oxidative stress, immune dysregulation, gut microbiome abnormality, and inadequate drug bioavailability, among others. To address these challenges, this project develops an oral nanomedicine platform based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles with a cerium oxide core, further coated with an outer membrane (OM) derived from Akkermansia muciniphila (Akk), a beneficial bacteria naturally present in the human gut. This novel nanocomplex, termed \"OM-CeMeso,\" is evaluated for its enhanced stability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capacity, and ability to restore microbiota homeostasis. This project demonstrates that the silica-based nanomaterials' acid-resistant yet base-degradable properties significantly improved stability in a murine IBD model. The incorporation of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs) added further benefits by enhancing ROS scavenging. Notably, the Akk-derived OM coat also increases the diversity and abundance of beneficial gut microbiota. These complementary and integrated functions lead to significant symptom alleviation in murine IBD models while avoiding any unwanted toxicity."

Along with the advances in nanotechnology, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) exhibiting diversiform size and shape, distinct morphological properties, and favorable physico-chemical features have become an ideal choice for drug delivery systems and inspire alternative thinking for the management of hepatic diseases. Initially, we introduce the physiological structure of the liver and highlight its intrinsic cell types and correlative functions. Next, we detail the synthesis methods and physicochemical properties of MSNs and their capacity for controlled drug loading and release. Particularly, we discuss the interactions between liver and MSNs with respect to the passive targeting mechanisms of MSNs within the liver by adjusting their particle size, pore diameter, surface charge, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, and surface functionalization. Subsequently, we emphasize the role of MSNs in regulating liver pathophysiology, exploring their value in addressing liver pathological states, such as tumors and inflammation, combined with multi-functional designs and intelligent modes to enhance drug targeting and minimize side effects. Lastly, we put forward the problems, challenges, opportunities, as well as clinical translational issues faced by MSNs in the management of liver diseases."

METHODS: Zirconia specimens were treated with air abrasion or CoJet, followed by the application of a zirconia primer and adhesive. Dual-cured resin cement cylinders were then bonded to the treated surfaces for microshear bond strength testing after 7 days in distilled water or after aging (30 days and 10,000 thermal cycles). Data were analyzed using three-way ANOVA (zirconia, treatment, and aging) and Tukey's test (α = 0.05). RESULTS: The triple interaction was not significant. Treatment*time and zirconia*time interactions were significant (p⟨0.001). 3YTZP exhibited higher bond strength at 7 days. Higher bond strength values were obtained for CoJet and Al2O3 air abrasion groups at 7 days (13.47 ± 3.55 MPa). All specimens presented adhesive failures. CONCLUSION: The type of zirconia significantly influenced the microshear bond strength. 3Y-TZP showed greater bond strength compared to translucent zirconias. Tribochemical coating promoted higher bond strength at both time points. Thermal cycling negatively affected the bond strength of all zirconias evaluated. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The observed variations in bond strength among different translucent zirconias emphasize the importance of material selection for optimal clinical outcomes. Additionally, the positive influence of tribochemical silica coating on bond strength highlights its potential as a valuable surface treatment for enhancing the durability of zirconia-based restorations in the oral environment. However, the detrimental effects of thermal cycling on bond strength emphasize the need for careful clinical considerations when fabricating and cementing translucent zirconia restorations."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among women globally, with traditional therapies often limited by challenges such as drug resistance and significant side effects. Combination therapies, coupled with nanotechnology-based co-delivery systems, offer enhanced efficacy by targeting multiple pathways in cancer progression. In this study, we developed an injectable, stimuli-responsive nanosystem using a chitosan hydrogel embedded with mesoporous silica nanoparticles for the co-administration of 5-fluorouracil and everolimus. This approach aims to optimize controlled drug release, enhance the synergistic anticancer effect, and overcome challenges associated with co-loading different therapeutic agents. METHODS: Various techniques were employed to characterize the nanoparticles and the hydrogel. Cell uptake, apoptosis, and proliferation of 4T1 breast cancer cells were evaluated by flow cytometry and Resazurin assay, respectively. The Balb/C mice model of breast cancer, which received the therapeutical nanoplatforms subcutaneously near the tumoral region was used to examine tumor size and lung metastases. RESULTS: The results revealed that the nanoparticles had a suitable loading capacity and high cellular uptake. The drug release was pH-sensitive and synergistic. By incorporating nanoparticles into the hydrogel, the cell death rate and apoptosis of 4T1 breast cancer cells increased significantly, due to the synergistic effects of co-delivered drugs. Additionally, the combination treatment groups showed a significant reduction in tumor size and lung metastasis compared to the monotherapy and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the potential of the nanocomposite used to develop a novel co-delivery system to enhance therapeutic outcomes, reduce side effects, and provide a promising new strategy for future cancer treatments.",

In this study, MSNs functionalized with folic acid (FA) and chitosan (CS) loaded with epirubicin (EPI) were characterized to evaluate the efficacy of these nanoparticles in inhibiting MCF-7cell line and in mice bearing 4 T1 tumor. MSN-EPI@CS-FA showed a high drug loading efficiency of 79.49 %, likely due to the large pore volume and surface functional groups on the MSNs. In both in vitro and in vivo studies, the functionalized MSNs exhibited superior efficacy compared to unmodified MSNs. Notablygene expression results revealed enhanced expression levels of proapoptotic markers (Bax, caspase 3, and caspase 9) and down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl-2, cyclin D, cyclin E, MMP-2, and MMP-9) in cells treated with MSN-EPI@CS-FA, indicating apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. In cells treated with MSN-EPI@CS-FA, there were significant changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, Malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and antioxidant enzyme activity compared to the MSN-EPI and EPI groups. In a murine 4 T1 breast tumor model, MSN-EPI@CS-FA more strongly than MSN-EPI inhibited tumor growth without drug accumulation in the liver or spleen and substantial targeting of the tumor, highlighting the efficacy of folate receptor-mediated active targeting in improving therapeutic outcomes. Therefore MSN-EPI@CS-FA exhibits significant promise as a potent anticancer therapy."

Acute lung injury (ALI) is a critical clinical syndrome involving bilateral lung infiltration and acute hypoxic respiratory failure. However, there is currently no effective treatment for these two diseases. Previous research has established that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is pivotal in the pathogenesis of silicosis and acute lung injury. Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) is a hydrolase enzyme of cAMP, and BI 1015550, as an inhibitor of PDE4B, is expected to be a candidate drug for treating both. BI 1015550 has shown certain anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties in systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but there is a lack of research on silicosis and acute lung injury. In this research, we successfully synthesized BI 1015550 autonomously and demonstrated that it could significantly improve lung fibrosis and inflammation in a silica-induced silicosis mouse model. Furthermore, we found that BI 1015550 could also alleviate lung inflammation in a Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury mouse model.

In the treatment of this condition, it is imperative to explore natural resources for therapeutic agents that exhibit fewer adverse effects and enhanced efficacy. Currently, the methods employed for isolating anti-diabetic lead compounds from natural sources are often intricate and time-consuming. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop efficient and rapid screening techniques. In this study, α-amylase was immobilized using a novel polydopamine/L-cysteine bifunctionalized magnetic mesoporous silica composite material (Fe3O4@nSiO2@mSiO2@PDA@L-Cys) for the first time. A ligand fishing approach utilizing the immobilized α-amylase was developed to rapidly screen for α-amylase inhibitors from Aloe vera. Characterization and property analysis of the immobilized enzyme showed that the immobilized α-amylase exhibited exceptional stability and reusability. Two ligands were successfully screened from Aloe vera and then characterized as aloin B and aloin A using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Their respective IC50 values were 0.99 ± 0.09 mM and 1.14 ± 0.05 mM. Molecular docking studies confirmed the interaction of both ligands with specific amino acid residues within the active site of α-amylase. The study presents a fast and efficient approach for screening α-amylase inhibitors from intricate natural sources, thereby offering significant potential for the development of anti-diabetic agents."

      "abstract": "Implant-related infections (IRIs) present a significant challenge in clinical treatment because of the formation of biofilms. The complex architecture of biofilms not only impedes antibiotic penetration, fostering the evolution of multidrug resistance in bacteria under minimal selective pressure but also suppresses the antimicrobial activity of macrophages and induces their pyroptosis in large quantities. This excessive pyroptosis impairs the collective immune function of macrophages, enabling pathogens to evade immune system clearance and rendering infection difficult to eradicate. Existing treatment strategies often necessitate extensive surgical debridement, which not only causes significant harm to patients' physiological health and quality of life but also results in limited therapeutic outcomes. To address these challenges, this study developed a mesoporous silica nanoparticle system (MRL) modified with the RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid) tripeptide and loaded with the antimicrobial peptide LL-37. The LL-37 released from MRL can not only directly disrupt bacterial cell membranes, preventing bacteria from developing resistance through conventional mutation mechanisms, but also enhance antimicrobial activity by modulating macrophage polarization toward the M1 phenotype. However, LL-37 may induce and exacerbate macrophage pyroptosis within biofilms. Therefore, we modified the nanoparticles with RGD to increase macrophage viability and reduce their number of deaths, thereby alleviating the immunosuppression caused by excessive macrophage pyroptosis. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that MRL, while preserving the antimicrobial activity and immunomodulatory function of LL-37, significantly reduced macrophage pyroptosis and protected the collective immune activity of macrophages. Thus, the fine-tuned regulation of immune response was achieved, providing new insights and strategies for the treatment of IRIs."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Haizao Yuhu Decoction (HYD) is a traditional Chinese herbal formula known for regulating Qi and dispersing stasis. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study investigates the effects of HYD on silica-induced lung injury and the underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The main constituents of HYD were identified using ultra-performance liquid chromatography Q-Exactive mass spectrometry (UPLC-QE-MS). Network pharmacology was employed to predict the targets and pathways through which HYD ameliorates silicosis, which were validated in a silica-induced lung injury mouse model and a TGF-β1-induced alveolar epithelial cell model. Pathological evaluation was conducted using hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and Masson staining, while inflammatory cytokines and fibrosis were assessed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and hydroxyproline quantification. Western blotting (WB) was performed to analyse protein expression levels of targeted markers. Proliferation and migration capabilities of MLE12 cells treated with HYD and its bioactive constituents (glycitein, diosmetin, and limonin) were assessed using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and wound healing assays. RESULTS: HYD significantly alleviated silica-induced lung injury, reducing inflammatory response and collagen deposition. A total of 176 constituents were identified in HYD, with 111 being pharmacologically active and linked to 1397 potential therapeutic targets, 107 associated with silicosis. Enrichment analyses highlighted the TGF-β1/Smad pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HYD's anti-silicosis effects, which was validated by the restoration of TGF-β1, p-Smad2/Smad2, p-Smad3/Smad3, E-cadherin, and Vimentin following HYD treatment. Additionally, glycitein, diosmetin, and limonin inhibited the proliferation and migration of TGF-β1-induced MLE12 cells and suppressed the activation of TGF-β1/Smad pathway and EMT. CONCLUSIONS: HYD effectively alleviates silica-induced lung injury by specifically inhibiting the TGF-β1/Smad pathway and EMT process.",

      "abstract": "Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) technology is a promising strategy for degrading proteins of interest. Traditional PROTACs, however, often face challenges such as poor solubility, low stability, and off-target toxicity. To address these challenges, we integrated nanotechnology to enhance the delivery of target-protein degraders to the tumor sites, thereby improving their properties. Here, we report silica-based nano-PROTACs (SiPROTACs) that feature multiple ligands on the surface to target and degrade the transmembrane protein epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). SiPROTACs, with a diameter of approximately 50 nm, can efficiently bind to EGFR, recruit cereblon (CRBN) to induce EGFR ubiquitination, and facilitate their degradation by proteasomes. In HCC-827 and PC-9 cell lines, SiPROTACs initiated EGFR degradation at a notably low concentration of 50 nM, demonstrating greater efficiency compared to traditional PROTACs. In HCC-827 xenograft tumor-bearing mice, SiPROTACs accumulated at tumor site for at least 48 h and exhibited significant anti-tumor effects in vivo without causing noticeable side effects. These findings suggest a novel approach for the application of PROTACs highlighting their therapeutic potential for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).",

      "abstract": "The molecular complexity of bladder cancer restricts reliance on single-feature or single-gene targeted therapies, necessitating integrated individualized treatments and multi-gene interventions. In this study, we introduced the CRISPR/dCas9-SAM system to BCa treatment, known for its high specificity, low off-target effects, and reduced genetic toxicity, making it ideal for multiplexed gene activation at minimal cost-just 20 nucleotides per target. However, despite its potential in complex gene therapy and cellular engineering, challenges persist due to safety concerns associated with viral vectors and the risk of off-target effects during in vivo delivery, necessitating the development of new vectors. Herein, we reported pH-sensitive hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles modified with PLZ4 ligands (PLZ4-Lip@AMSN/CRISPR/dCas9-SAM, PLACS NPs) for precise targeting of bladder tumors and co-delivery of CRISPR/dCas9-SAM system. With good stability and high plasmid loading capacity, they efficiently co-delivered dCas9-VP64, MS2-P65-HSF1, and sgRNA. Compared to Lipofectamine 3000, these nanoparticles exhibited superior lysosomal escape capability, significantly enhancing transfection efficiency in bladder cancer cells. Moreover, PLACS NPs simultaneously activated the expression of four target genes, inhibiting proliferation and migration, and promoting apoptosis in bladder cancer cells. In vivo, they achieved efficient gene editing at tumor sites, significantly inhibiting bladder tumor growth. Real-time imaging revealed their substantial accumulation and prolonged retention at bladder tumor sites without significant liver targeting and major organ damage, showcasing good specificity and biosafety. This study overcomes in vivo delivery challenges of multi-component CRISPR/dCas9 systems, enabling precise gene editing and anti-tumor effects, presenting an innovative strategy for targeted therapy in bladder cancer treatment. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study introduces a newly-developed approach to address key challenges in bladder cancer gene therapy, namely low gene upregulation efficiency, limited targeting specificity, and inefficient nucleic acid delivery. By integrating the CRISPR/dCas9-SAM system, we achieve highly specific gene activation with minimal off-target effects, enabling the addition of treatment targets with just 20 nucleotides per target. To improve bladder cancer targeting, we developed PLACS NPs, a mesoporous silica nanoparticle system that enhances plasmid delivery, transfection efficiency, and endosomal escape. This system shows good tumor targeting and significant anti-tumor effects in bladder cancer, without significant liver targeting and major organ toxicity, offering promising therapeutic potential and broad clinical applications.",

METHODS: The lab-based comparative study was approved by the ethical committee of King Saud University under IRB number F98-971X9 and was completed in three months (June to September, 2024). Eighty-four YTZP zirconia discs were created and sorted into four groups based on different conditioning agents: Group-I (APA) as the control, Group-II (TBC), Group-III (FS laser), and Group-IV (Nano-HA coating). Ra was measured on five discs from each group using a profilometer, while surface topography was examined through SEM analysis. Ten specimens per group were bonded with luting cement, followed by SBS testing and fracture mode analysis using a universal testing machine and stereomicroscope, respectively. One-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey tests (p<0.05) was used for statistical analysis of Ra and SBS means across the groups. RESULTS: Group-IV (Nano-HA coating) exhibited the highest Ra and SBS values. Conversely, Group II (TBC) displayed the lowest Ra and weakest bond strength. CONCLUSION: Nano-HA coating and FS laser can be employed as viable alternatives to APA without compromising the physical and mechanical properties of zirconia ceramic."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Engineered stone (ES), a material that has become widespread for its use in kitchen and bathroom countertops since the 1980s, is composed of over 90% crystalline silica by weight, significantly exceeding the silica content of natural stones such as granite (40-50%) and marble (< 10%). Workers fabricating ES are exposed to dangerously high levels of respirable crystalline silica (RCS) and other toxic chemicals, which increases the risk of developing silicosis and other lung and systemic diseases. The purpose of this review is to explore the epidemiology, occupational risks, regulatory gaps, diagnostic evaluation, and clinical challenges associated with ES dust exposure. MAIN BODY: ES silicosis was first described in the early 2010s among ES countertop workers in Spain, Italy, and Israel. Since then, hundreds of cases have emerged worldwide, namely in China, Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Belgium. Silicosis from ES dust is accelerated and diagnosed after 7-19 years of exposure, often affecting young individuals (median age 33-55 years) from marginalized or immigrant communities. Morbidity and mortality are poor, with high rates of lung transplantation and death. Industrial hygiene air sample monitoring data shows that despite engineering controls such as wet saws and exhaust ventilation, exposure to respirable crystalline silica when cutting ES frequently exceeds safe exposure levels. Diagnostic evaluation and treatment are clinically challenging due to delayed medical screening, misdiagnosis, and lack of treatment options. CONCLUSIONS: This review underscores the urgent need for enhanced occupational safety regulations, active screening, and healthcare support to address the rising burden of ES silicosis among vulnerable worker populations globally."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cordyceps sinensis is a valuable Chinese medicine that has the effects of tonifying the lungs and kidneys, regulating the immune system, etc. Fermented Cordyceps Powder (FCP) is the fermentation product of Cordyceps sinensis mycelium, which has similar composition and effects to natural Cordyceps sinensis. FCP has been used as an adjunctive treatment of silicosis, however, the complete comprehension of these molecular mechanisms remains elusive. AIM OF THE STUDY: To study the molecular immunological mechanism by which FCP alleviate inflammation and fibrosis in silicosis based on macrophage polarization and High Mobility Group Box protein 1 (HMGB1)-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) pathway through in vivo and in vitro experiments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A rat model of silicosis and a co-culture cell model (NR8383 and RFL-6) exposed to silica were established and then intervened with different levels of FCP and FCP-containing serum, respectively, to explore the impacts of FCP on silica-induced inflammation and fibrosis and macrophage polarization at different time points. Upon the application of glycyrrhizic acid (GZA) to suppress HMGB1, an extensive analysis was undertaken to elucidate the impact of HMGB1-TLR4-NF-κB axis on the macrophages polarization. RESULTS: FCP reduced M1, M2 macrophage polarization, and the HMGB1 expression in the lung of silicosis rats. Suppression of HMGB1 led to a pronounced reduction in the polarization of M1 macrophages, whereas it exerted no significant influence on the polarization of M2 macrophages. FCP-containing serum reduced silica-induced inflammation and fibrosis in the co-culture cell system. FCP-containing serum also reduced M1 macrophage polarization and inhibited stimulation of the HMGB1-TLR4-NF-κB signaling axis in NR8383 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of M1, M2 macrophage polarization is an important mechanism by which FCP attenuates inflammation and fibrosis in silicosis, in which reduction of M1 macrophage polarization may be achieved by suppression of the HMGB1-TLR4-NF-κB signaling axis.",

      "abstract": "A large amount of purified water is used in conventional hemodialysis (HD) for treating end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). To minimize the water demand and waste generation, the regeneration of dialysis solution is considered the most efficient control strategy. In this study, an innovative dual-layer hollow fiber (DLHF) mixed matrix membrane (MMM) incorporated with amine-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MPS-NPs) was developed to regenerate spent dialysis solution. The fabricated DLHF-MMM configuration enabled the continuous removal of small, medium, and large weight uremic toxins (UTs) through dual mechanisms. The inner layer composed of polyethersulfone (PES) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) rejected medium-large weight UTs (i.e., MW > 500 Da) via the molecular sieving. Meanwhile, the outer layer containing amine-functionalized MPS-NPs effectively removed small weight UTs, such as urea and creatinine. The DLHF-MMM with 6 wt% of amine-functionalized MPS-NPs demonstrated the most favorable characteristics, i.e., high water permeability (298.6 ± 3.2 mL/m2.h.mmHg) and adsorption capacity of urea (523.5 mg/g) and creatinine (28.1 mg/g). Notably, the optimal membrane (DLHF-4) also achieved favorable removal rates from the spent dialysis solution of actual patient, i.e., urea (74.4 %), creatinine (56 %), hippuric acid (16.1 %), and lysozyme (58.7 %, additionally spiked as a mimicking for β-2 microglobulin). These results indicate that the fabricated DLHF-MMM in this study can effectively overcome the challenges posed by the complex matrix components. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that the DLHF-MMM incorporated with amine-functionalized MPS-NPs is a promising and potential tool for the regeneration of dialysis solution. Furthermore, this approach can contribute to water conservation and reduce the burden on wastewater treatment processes associated with wastewater generated from conventional HD."

      "abstract": "Synthetic dyes are predominantly emitted into the eco-environment resulting, in harmful effects on the environment and human. This study presents a new perspective on the mesoporous silica (SBA-16) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) obtained from rice husk ash as substrates for Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) to investigate their morphological and Fenton catalytic characteristics towards degradation of synthetic acid blue 40 dye (AB40). The adsorption and Fenton catalytic properties of AB40 dye by the prepared Fe3O4, Fe3O4/SBA-16 and Fe3O4/rGO catalysts were examined. The successful synthesis of such catalysts was affirmed by the results obtained from FE-SEM, EDX, TEM, FTIR, XRD and nitrogen adsorption measurements. The adsorption of AB40 dye followed the Langmuir model, with maximum adsorption capacities of 169.2, 21.1 and 16.6 mg/g for Fe3O4, for Fe3O4/SBA-16 and Fe3O4/rGO, respectively. This result was explained based on their specific surface areas. The decolorization efficiency was estimated through several factors, including initial dye concentration, pH and H2O2 concentration. The results disclosed that a catalyst dose = 1 g/L, initial dye concentration = 50 mg/L, pH = 3 and [H2O2] = 15 mmol/L are the optimum conditions for full decolorization of AB40 within 60 min at 35 °C. The prepared Fe3O4 NPs exhibited a superior Fenton activity at 25 °C and pH 3. However, both composites increased Fenton performance above 25 °C, indicating that SBA-16 and rGO substrates can enhance the stability of Fe2+ to generate a higher amount of hydroxyl radicals. Regeneration results disclosed that the obtained Fenton-like catalysts revealed notably high catalytic efficiency (> 95%) and stability, with minimal decrease in activity observed after running four cycles of AB40 dye degradation at pH 3 and 35 °C. Thus, this study demonstrated that both SBA-16 and rGO substrates obtained from rice husk ash improved the reusability and stability of Fe3O4 catalysts in wastewater treatment using heterogeneous Fenton reactions."

The CMS capsules were synthesized and applied for batch study and evaluated using statistical modelling. Various analytical techniques, such as Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetry-Differential Thermal Analysis (TG-DTA), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, UV-Vis Spectrophotometry, and Vibrating Sample Magnetometry (VSM), were employed to validate the formation of the CMS. Rough surface as shown by SEM analysis, presence of various functional groups as shown by FT-IR spectrum and presence Fe atoms in EDX spectrum are indication of formation of complete composite. The surface area of CMS recorded by BJH method was 39.05 m2 g-1 with pore capacity 0.259 cm3 g-1. According to IUPAC classification, class IV isotherm was observed for nitrogen adsorption-desorption curves. The specific magnetization of CMS was 4.28 emu g-1 indicating fare degree of magnetism making it easily separable using external magnet. Batch trails as well as screening experiments were conducted for the sequestration of RB and RY dyes. Dose 50 mg, interface time 60 min and solution pH of 3.0 depicted maximum removal efficacy of more than 95 % in both dyes even at high initial concentration of 200 mg L-1. The adsorption capacities for RB-19 dye and RY-17 dye were found to be 455.86 and 344.06 mg g-1 respectively in accordance with pseudo second order kinetics (R2 = 0.997 and 0.962 respectively) and Langmuir adsorption isotherm (R2 = 0.972 and 0.992 respectively) models. Six adsorption-desorption cycles were conducted for regeneration potential of CMS showcasing repeated usability after regeneration in alkaline medium. E-factor value of 0.04 depicted CMS capsules was sustainable in and eco-friendly with low waste generation."

Nanoconfinement, the spatial restriction of nano-sized particles within a larger porous substrate, not only can address critical challenges and sustainability concerns in environmental nanotechnology but also offers unique opportunities otherwise inaccessible by unconfined, bulk-phase nanomaterials. In this perspective, we propose mesoporous silica (mSiO2) as an innovative framework for spatially confining metal nanoparticles in a well-controlled manner, offering an effective nanoconfinement engineering strategy for sustainable water management and environmental applications. We first summarize the current understanding of nanoconfinement effects and briefly review previous approaches to the fabrication of engineered nanoconfinement materials. We then present a layer-by-layer engineering strategy to confine various metal nanoparticles within multi-shelled mSiO2 structures, exploring their unique nanoconfinement features and potential environmental applications, e.g. tandem catalysis, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensor, and visible-light-driven water treatment. Finally, we discuss challenges in studying nanoconfinement effects and outline future research directions to advance sustainable innovation. Opportunities for practical implementation exist at the intersection of fundamental studies and engineering disciplines, emphasizing the need for parallel efforts to establish system characterization standards and enable effective technological integration at scale."

      "abstract": "Current standard pharmacological treatment of retinal vascular diseases requires frequent intravitreal injection every 4-12 weeks. Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with better pharmacokinetics (PK), allowing less frequent administrations, remain to be discovered and developed. In preclinical stage mostly small molecule New Chemical Entities (NCEs) and peptides represent promising candidates. However, they typically suffer from fast clearance from the eye upon intravitreal injection, which confines support of animal models as sufficient exposure over 1-4 weeks in the eye is not reached. Addressing this need of extended-release (XR) formulations to enable such animal models, we hereby present chitosan embedded silica particles in suspension (CHESS). We identified non-mesoporous silica matrix particles as suitable biodegradable XR formulation and established a preparation method to control their degree of condensation, erosion rate and finally the release rate. Applicability for different API candidates was demonstrated by successful embedding of two model small molecules and one model peptide at high drug loads of >20 %, respectively. The ability to control release rate was demonstrated in vitro. High intravitreal mobility, which is a disadvantage of uncoated silica microparticles and other intravitreally applied XR microparticle formulations, was reduced by surface-coating with a polycationic chitosan-derivative. This leads to formation of stable depots in the vitreous after injection, which can be easily separated from the retina, facilitating PK analysis and pharmacodynamic (PD) readouts. Furthermore, we showed good tolerability and low toxicity on ARPE-19 cells.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by oxidative stress and dopaminergic neuron damage. While levodopa remains the cornerstone of PD treatment, its efficacy is limited by poor bioavailability and neuroprotective effects. Curcumin, a potent antioxidant derived from turmeric, demonstrates neuroprotective promise but also suffers from low bioavailability, hindering its therapeutic application. The combined therapeutic use of levodopa and curcumin offers a potential synergistic approach, though its neuroprotection potential through brain-targeted delivery remains underexplored. PURPOSE: To develop a lactoferrin-modified organic-inorganic hybrid mesoporous silica nanoparticle system (Lf-lip@LC-MSNs) for co-delivering levodopa and curcumin, aiming to enhance neuroprotective efficacy and achieve brain-targeted delivery in PD. METHODS: Lf-lip@LC-MSNs were engineered to encapsulate levodopa within a curcumin-loaded lipid bilayer, modified with lactoferrin for optimized brain-targeted delivery. In vitro studies were conducted on rotenone-damaged neuronal models to evaluate oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, α-synuclein aggregation, and neuronal survival. In vivo experiments on MPTP-induced PD mouse models evaluated biodistribution, therapeutic efficacy, and safety in healthy mice, focusing on motor function recovery. RESULTS: The combination of levodopa and curcumin significantly reduced oxidative stress and α-synuclein accumulation, enhancing neuronal survival compared to monotherapies. Lf-lip@LC-MSNs further amplified these effects, achieving superior brain-targeted delivery and improved motor function restoration with minimal systemic toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of curcumin and levodopa provided synergistic neuroprotection in PD models. By employing a targeted delivery system, the Lf-lip@LC-MSNs not only facilitated efficient brain targeting but also potentiated therapeutic outcomes, providing a compelling strategy for treating PD and paving the way for advancements in managing other neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Silica scaling poses a substantial challenge in the advanced treatment of industrial wastewater by reverse osmosis (RO) membranes, while the existing methods modifying RO membranes to enhance antisilica scaling performance often compromise water permeance. Herein, we fabricated a sulfonated RO membrane (SLRO) using sodium lignosulfonate as a comonomer, achieving an enhanced charge density and reduced coordination capacity. SLRO exhibited superior antisilica scaling performance, reducing scaling rates by ∼145, ∼166, and ∼157% under acidic, neutral, and alkaline conditions compared to the control. Reduced density gradient analysis confirmed that sulfonic acid groups (-SO3H) on the SLRO surface increased the repulsion of silicic acid. Moreover, the SLRO demonstrated reductions of ∼112, ∼137, and ∼133% in cation-mediated silica scaling rates under the same conditions, attributed to the weaker coordination between -SO3H and cations, which diminished the cation-bridging effect. Furthermore, SLRO membranes exhibited high pure water permeance (3.3 L m-2 h-1 bar-1) and NaCl rejection (99.2%), with a water/NaCl selectivity (7.8 bar-1) three times greater than that of the control (2.6 bar-1), primarily attributed to increased surface roughness and reduced apparent thickness of the PA layer.

      "abstract": "Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a significant indoor pollutant found in various sources and poses potential health risks to humans. Noble metal catalysts show efficient and stable catalytic activity for ambient-temperature HCHO oxidation, yet suffer from low metal utilization. Efforts focus on designing catalysts with enhanced intrinsic activity and reduced noble metal loading. In this study, we developed a simple pretreatment method using ammonia solution on SiO2 carrier to enhance the activity of the Pd/SiO2 catalyst for HCHO oxidation. After the carrier was pretreated with an ammonia solution, a significant promoting effect was observed on the Pd/SiO2(NH3·H2O)-R catalyst. It achieved almost complete oxidation of 150 ppmV of HCHO at 25 °C, much better than the Pd/SiO2-R (5% HCHO conversion rate). Multiple characterization results indicated that the ammonia solution pretreatment of the SiO2 carrier increased the surface defects, facilitating the anchoring of Pd nanoparticles and increasing their dispersion. The increase dispersion of Pd resulted in the generation of additional oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surfaces. The increased in oxygen vacancies on the catalyst was beneficial for enhancing the catalyst's ability to activate H2O to form surface hydroxyl groups, thereby accelerating the catalytic oxidation process of HCHO. The reaction mechanism of HCHO on the Pd/SiO2(NH3·H2O)-R catalyst mainly follows an efficient pathway: firstly, the HCHO being oxidized by surface active hydroxyl groups to formate; subsequently, the formate being oxidized by hydroxyl groups to H2O and CO2. This study provides a promising strategy for designing high-performance noble metal catalysts for HCHO catalytic oxidation.",

      "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is the leading cause of death globally, often resulting to significant loss of cardiac function. A key factor in the pathological progression of MI is the excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by dysfunctional mitochondria. However, no antioxidant therapy has been approved for clinical treatment of MI to date. In this study, selenium-loaded porous silica nanospheres (Se@PSN) are synthesized as a novel therapeutic approach for MI. These nanospheres are capable of neutralizing various ROS, thereby reducing hypoxia-induced myocardial cell damage. Additionally, Se@PSN promote the upregulation of antioxidant proteins, providing sustained intracellular ROS scavenging, which helps reduce infarct size and preserve cardiac function post-MI. The sustained antioxidant effects of Se@PSN are attributed to their ability to safeguard mitochondrial function by modulating oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitophagy. The activation of mitophagy by Se@PSN is achieved through the upregulation of HIF-1α expression. In conclusion, Se@PSN show significant potential for clinical translation as a novel therapeutic strategy for MI.",

      "abstract": "Silica exposure-induced airway epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical pathological process in pulmonary fibrosis. This study investigated the role of NLRP3 inflammasome, glycolysis, and histone lactylation in silica-induced EMT of human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE). Silica exposure activated NLRP3 inflammasome, enhanced glycolysis and H3K18 lactylation, as well as induced EMT in 16HBE cells. Selective inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950, blockade of the interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptor with AF12198, or suppression of lactate production with oxamate effectively reduced glycolysis-mediated histone lactylation and mitigated silica-induced EMT. Moreover, silica-induced upregulation of PFKFB3, a key enzyme of glycolysis, was significantly mitigated by MCC950 or AF12198. Cut&Tag analysis revealed silica treatment led to H3K18 lactylation enrichment at transcription start sites (TSS), particularly within the promoter region of the sine oculis homeobox 1 (SIX1), which enhanced transcription of SIX1, a key transcription factor involved in EMT. Consistently, inhibition of histone lactylation by the histone acetyltransferase P300 inhibitor A-485 suppressed silica-induced SIX1 expression and EMT. These findings indicate that silica activates NLRP3 inflammasome and promotes interleukin 1β (IL-1β) production, thereafter enhancing PFKFB3-mediated glycolysis by IL-1 receptor. Lactate accumulation by glycolysis enhances H3K18 lactylation at the TSS facilitating expression of SIX1. Together, this inflammation-glycolysis-lactylation cascade involved in EMT provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis.",

However, the deployment of alternative antibiotics is lagging far behind the fast evolving antibiotic resistance, which demands effective strategies to restore drug-resistance sensitivity to available antibiotics. Here, a well-known antitumor lipoprotein complex consisted of bovine α-lactalbumin and oleic acid (BAMLET) was electrostatically adsorbed on the surface of mesoporous silica nanomaterials (MSN), forming an antibiotic adjuvant to re-sensitize methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to aminoglycoside antibiotics. It was found MSN of distinctive particle size may cause conformational changes of bound lipoprotein complex affecting the bactericidal performance of formed BAMLET@MSN conjugates (BMSN). Moreover, MSN was loaded with curcumin to endow obtained BMSN improved bioavailability and antioxidant capacity. The mechanistic studies revealed that antibacterial activities of BMSN originated from bacterial cell membrane disruption and biofilm inhibition, which promoted antibiotic entry and restored antibiotic bactericidal efficacy in the cell. Finally, transcriptomic analysis of MRSA indicated that BMSN interfered with bacterial amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate synthesis, and ATP translocation in bacteria. Therefore, the constructed BMSN/curcumin as potent antibiotic adjuvant provided a manipulable nanoplatform to tackle the antibiotic resistance crisis.",

However, the effect of chitosan-based coating on fruit flavor during ripening is rarely reported. In this study, the postharvest qualities of hardy kiwifruits were investigated using chitosan coating and chitosan-silica nanoparticle coating (CTS-SiNPs) during storage at 25°C and 4°C. Physicochemical analyses showed that chitosan coating extended the shelf-life by delaying ripening and maintaining higher quality than uncoated fruits, and CTS-SiNPs treatment showed a superior preservation effect compared to CTS treatment. Untargeted metabolomics analysis based on HS-SPME-GC-MS was used to comprehensively evaluate the volatile profiles of hardy kiwifruits during postharvest storage. The metabolomics analysis showed that two chitosan coating treatments greatly delayed the accumulation of most volatiles while delaying the ripening process, and the differential volatiles were mostly involved in the terpenoids biosynthesis pathway. Notably, most green leaf volatiles (C6/C9 aldehydes, esters and alcohols) and methyl salicylate were up-regulated in the CTS-SiNPs coating groups. In addition, odor activity value (OAV) was used to characterize the key aroma-active compounds and odor profiles. A total of 32 compounds were identified as key aroma-active compounds (OAV ≥ 1) in hardy kiwifruits. The odor profile evaluation showed that the CTS-SiNPs coating treatment enhanced the intensity of the \"herbal\" odor, while reducing the intensity of \"sweet\" and \"floral\" odors in hardy kiwifruits at the eating-ripe stage.",

In a small-scale column leaching, a total of four cells loaded with pyritic waste rock (11 wt% S) from an operating Cu mine in Sweden were kept in a climatic chamber at a controlled temperature and humidity. The waste rock was leached for 11 weeks before treatment using alkaline silicate solution was applied, without pH buffer and adjuster. One cell was left untreated, whereas the others were treated with silicate solution as a source of dissolved silica, with and without H2O2 pre-oxidation. The pH in silica-treated cells generated leachate with circumneutral pH until the end of the leaching cycle, whereas sulfide oxidation accelerated in the absence of treatment. Leachate quality in all Si-treated cells improved, as evidenced by the suppressed release of sulfur and other metals (e.g., Al, Fe, Cu, Co, Mn, and Ni). Upon treatment with a longer contact time, silica (SiO2) layer developed on waste rock and inhibited pyrite. The layer remained stable upon extended exposure to air and water for up to 10 weeks after treatment. Despite forming a siliceous Fe-O phase, H2O2 pre-oxidation resulted in indirect oxidation of sulfides and other phases. With an excess of silicate solution and at alkaline pH, pyrite surfaces are devoid of coating and metal ions were mobilized. Finally, this study suggested that treatment of pyritic waste rock using silica can attenuate ARD formation and prevent metal leaching by pyrite inhibition and maintaining a circumneutral pH environment or both.",

Herein, a strategy for morphology and size control of hollow polymer@silica microspheres is proposed. Multilayer core-shell polymer microspheres, containing substantial carboxyl groups inside, evolve into microspheres with a 304 nm hollow structure after alkali treatment, which are used to construct hollow polymer@silica microspheres by coating the inorganic layer using the layer-by-layer (LBL) and sol-gel methods, respectively. The inorganic shell thickness of hollow polymer@silica microspheres can be adjusted from 15 nm to 33 nm by the self-assembled layers in the LBL method and from 15 nm to 63 nm by the dosage of precursor in the sol-gel method. Compared to the LBL method, the hollow polymer@silica microspheres prepared via the sol-gel method have a uniform and dense inorganic shell, thus ensuring the complete spherical morphology of the microspheres after calcination, even if the inorganic shell thickness is only 15 nm. Moreover, the hollow polymer@silica microspheres prepared via the sol-gel method exhibit improved compression resistance and good opacity, remaining intact at 16,000 psi and providing the corresponding coating with transmittance lower than 35.1%. This work highlights the morphology regulation of microspheres prepared by different methods and provides useful insights for the design of composites microspheres with controllable structures."

      "abstract": "Mesoporous silica sieves have been prepared through sol-gel synthesis using diester gemini surfactants as pore templates, aiming to obtain new materials with potential use for water remediation. A series of mesoporous spherical silica particles of submicron size have been prepared in an alkali-catalyzed reaction, using a tetraethyl orthosilicate precursor and bis-quaternary ammonium gemini surfactants with diester spacers of varied lengths as pore-forming agents. The effect of the spacer length on the particle morphology was studied using nitrogen porosimetry, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), ultra-small-angle neutron scattering, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM). The results revealed that for all spacer lengths, a long-range hexagonal pore ordering developed in the materials. The silica particles were nearly spherical, with sizes below 1 micrometer, and a weak dependence of the mean particle size on the spacer length could be observed. The template removal procedure had a strong influence on the porosity: calcination caused a moderate shrinkage of the pores while retaining the hexagonal structure, whereas treatment with acidified ethanol resulted in only partial removal of the surfactants; however, the hexagonal structure was severely destroyed. The applicability of the obtained calcined materials as adsorbents for heavy metal ions from water was studied with the example of Pb(II). A high sorption capacity of 110 mg/g was obtained in batch experiments, at pH 5 and 4 h contact time."

      "abstract": "Silica aerogels are extensively used as catalyst supports due to their mesoporous structure and chemical inertness. In this study, SiO2-AuNP aerogels containing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized using the sol-gel method followed by supercritical CO2 drying. The inclusion of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as a stabilizing agent preserved the gold particle sizes during the gelation process. In contrast, aerogels synthesized without PVP contained enlarged AuNP aggregates, resulting in a shift in the plasmon resonance color from red to bluish or blue-grey. Thermal treatment of these bluish-colored aerogels at high temperatures restored their red coloration, visually indicating the breakdown of large gold clusters into individual nanoparticles. Both types of aerogels were characterized using SEM, TEM, 3D optical microscopy, UV-vis and ATR-IR spectroscopy, and N2 porosimetry, with their properties analyzed as a function of annealing temperature. Their catalytic activity was evaluated through the reduction of 4-nitrophenol with sodium borohydride, and both aerogel types demonstrated catalytic activity. This thermal conversion of large clusters into individual nanoparticles within an aerogel matrix introduces a new and promising approach for creating catalytically active nanogold-containing aerogel catalysts."

Other crystalline silica-induced pulmonary disorders include a predisposition to mycobacterial infections, obstructive airway diseases, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and lung cancer. This review paper discusses the burden of silicosis and associated co-morbidities in developed as well as developing countries globally using the published data of various government agencies, related organizations, and epidemiological findings. Moreover, it sheds light on diverse mechanisms of silicosis, outlining molecular events and peculiar alterations in lung parenchyma leading to this occupational lung disease. Evaluation of pathophysiological mechanisms could aid in the identification of novel target molecules and treatments; to date, there is no curative treatment for silicosis. In recent periods, a lot of attention has been focused on the development and fabrication of suitable nanocarriers for improved and sustained drug delivery in the pulmonary system. Nanoparticle-based therapeutic modality has been evaluated in in-vitro and ex-vivo silicosis models for prolongation of drug activity and improved therapeutic outcomes. The preclinical findings open the doors to clinical trials for operational and regenerative nanoformulations, which eventually create a positive change in medical practice. The following review summarizes various therapeutic approaches available and in the pipe line for silicosis and also stresses the preventive practices for effectively combating this occupational hazard."

      "abstract": "Catalytic ozonation technology can quickly and inexpensively treat antibiotic wastewater, where the performance of catalysts determines the level of catalytic efficiency. In this study, CuOx/MgO-SiO2 (represented by CuMgSiO) catalysts were prepared using hydrothermal method. Their structure and properties were analyzed by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and automatic specific surface area analyzer. The effects of O3 concentration, catalyst dosage and initial pH on the degradation of Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) were investigated. Catalytic ozonation mechanisms and degradation pathways of the pollutants were revealed by quenching experiments and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The toxicity of SMX and its intermediates was analyzed by ECOSAR software. The results showed that CuOx/MgO was successfully loaded onto SiO2 aerogel and the catalyst exhibited a porous network structure. The highest removal efficiency of SMX reached 87.92% and Kobs was 0.07045 min-1 under the optimum conditions, which was 35.9% and 2.77 times higher than those of ozonation alone. The ·OH, ·O2- and 1O2 were active species for the degradation of SMX, and 1O2 played a dominant role. Valence cycling between Cu2+/Cu+ and Mg2+/Mg and adsorption of O3 by surface hydroxyl groups were key steps in catalytic ozonation, and the toxicity of wastewater after treatment was greatly reduced. This study not only provides an economically feasible catalyst, but also offers a new perspective in the field of antibiotic wastewater treatment.",

This review begins by examining novel synthesis techniques, including sol-gel processing, chemical crosslinking, and templating, that enhance both the microstructural and functional properties of aerogels. Next, we explore the applications of graphene and silica aerogels in environmental and energy conservation technologies. Graphene aerogels, in particular, demonstrate significant potential in water purification by effectively removing antibiotics, offering a new approach to water treatment. The combination of silica aerogels with phase change materials, along with their use in supercapacitors, demonstrates their potential for energy conservation. Additionally, we discuss the synergistic effects of silica and graphene aerogels, which further broaden their applications. Finally, the paper concludes by summarizing the potential of graphene and silica aerogels as functional materials for environmental applications and outlining the challenges and future directions for their development and industrial use.",

The aim of this study was to produce nanoparticles from the agro-food waste, Cucumeropsis mannii melon seed husk extract (MSHE), whose burned seeds in Nigeria become incorporated into the soil contributing to pollution; and to propose a potential remediation biomarker adoptable to a metal-exposed animal model. Sol-gel precipitated melon husk silica nanoparticles were characterized by spectrophotometric and X-ray diffraction analysis. Biochemical and histopathological tests were performed on male albino rats divided into 8 groups orally exposed to Ni, Al, and Ni/Al both alone as well as co-administrated with MSHE at several dosages. Metal exposure reduced levels of plasma gonadotropin hormones follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), and the sex steroid hormone testosterone, but MSHE co-administration increased them. MSHE treatment alone also raised FSH and LH levels compared to the metal-exposed groups. Plasma gonadotropin prolactin (PRL) levels were higher in each group examined, whereas MSHE co-administration significantly lowered them. Additionally, MSHE treatment alone exhibited lower PRL levels than the mixture-exposed groups and increased testosterone levels. Plasma hormonal results were confirmed by regeneration of testis architecture, testis lipid peroxidation decreases, and testis antioxidant increases. Use of agro-food waste nanoparticles has significant implications as evaluated with male albino rat plasma hormone levels. MSHE may ameliorate Ni-Al mixture-induced testicular toxicity and may be a useful future therapeutic tool.",

Following amination and Pd loading treatment on YS-x, a series of catalysts Pd-YS-x-NH2 were obtained successfully and applied to formic acid (FA) dehydrogenation for hydrogen (H2) generation. The optimal catalyst Pd-YS-6-NH2, which has an appropriate yolk size and shell thickness, the largest specific surface area, and pore volume, as well as the smallest Pd nanoparticles (NPs), exhibits dehydrogenation performance far superior to that of other reference catalysts. It shows an extraordinary turnover frequency (TOF, 4508 h-1) and excellent stability at 60 °C with sodium formate (SF). After five testing cycles, it still maintained 100% FA conversion, and the decline in catalytic performance is almost negligible. The excellent catalytic performance of Pd-YS-6-NH2 is attributed to the optimal yolk-shell structure, the introduction of amine groups, and highly dispersed and ultrasmall Pd NPs (1.5 nm). This study provides methods for yolk-shell catalyst design and development for FA dehydrogenation."

      "abstract": "In the process of drilling and development of tight sandstone reservoirs, a large number of external fluids can invade the pore structure of the reservoir due to its strong hydrophilicity, resulting in blockage of the pore structure and a decrease in oil and gas production capacity. To reduce the aqueous phase trapping damage of tight sandstone reservoirs, the SiO2@KH550/FC-A nano-composite system was prepared to construct hydrophobic surfaces in core samples. First, the surface of nano-SiO2 was modified by KH550 to prepare nanoparticles with good dispersion. FTIR, XRD, SEM, and TG were used to characterize the nanoparticles before and after modification. The fluorosurfactant FC-A was prepared in the laboratory and combined with SiO2@KH550 to produce the SiO2@KH550/FC-A composite system. The system increases the contact angle of the hydrophilic surface from approximately 20° to 130°, achieving wetting modification. Excellent stability of hydrophobicity was obtained, and the contact angle did not significantly decrease within 5 minutes. In contrast, using FC-A and SiO2@KH550 individually, the contact angle of the hydrophilic surface could not be increased to over 90°. The SEM results showed that after treatment with the composite system, a layer of micro-nanoscale particles was attached to the hydrophilic surface. It was proved that SiO2@KH550 and FC-A were adsorbed on the surface, forming a low surface free energy solid interface at the micro and nano scales, which greatly improved the surface hydrophobicity. Furthermore, after the composite system was used to treat tight sandstone cores aged at 100° for 16 hours, the amount of imbibition of the core samples treated with SiO2@KH550/FC-A significantly decreased from 2.6 mL of brine to only 0.5 mL after 8 hours. The core spontaneous imbibition rate was also reduced to 0.0004 g min-1 within 5 minutes, while the maximum brine water spontaneous imbibition rate was 0.27 g min-1. The core displacement experiment further showed that the fluid in the core pores can be more easily flowed back under gas displacement after wetting modification. The water saturation of the core samples decreased to 16.3% after displacement, and the core permeability recovered to 88.4%, indicating that the SiO2@KH550/FC-A composite system can significantly improve the liquid phase flowback ability."

Despite extensive research, no clinical therapies effectively target ferroptosis in IR injury. This study aims to develop selenium-quantum-dot-loaded porous silica nanospheres (Se@PSN) as a novel therapeutic approach to address IR injury. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Se@PSN were synthesized and tested for their reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capabilities and biocompatibility. Additionally, the effects of Se@PSN on ferroptosis, mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress, and myocardial IR injury severity were evaluated. RESULTS: Se@PSN enhanced the stability of selenium quantum dots and exhibited strong ROS scavenging abilities. Additionally, Se@PSN exhibited excellent biocompatibility. The Se@PSN treatment increased GPX4 levels, effectively inhibiting ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, Se@PSN promoted the expression of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, mitigating oxidative phosphorylation damage and preserving mitochondrial function. These effects collectively resulted in reduced myocardial loss, inflammation, and fibrosis following IR injury. Compared to PSN alone, Se@PSN showed superior therapeutic efficacy against IR injury. CONCLUSION: Se@PSN exhibit great potential in reducing ferroptosis and protecting mitochondrial function, making them a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of myocardial IR injury.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, the interest in the design of particles that combine therapy and diagnosis simultaneously to obtain a theranostic material has increased. One of the most used materials for MRI diagnosis is iron oxide, where clusters of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIONs) are noteworthy candidates. These particles are of high interest due to their broad range of applications, such as contrast agents, use in magnetic separation processes, and in hyperthermia therapy, among others. One of the major problems with their use is maintaining superparamagnetism while having the highest magnetization-to-particle ratio. In this work, microwave-assisted synthesis of clusters formed by SPIONs has been investigated. This synthesis strategy allows for significant reduction in the time and energy required to obtain SPION clusters. Also, the magnetization-to-particle ratio has been increased in comparison with single SPIONs. Subsequently, the clusters are coated with amorphous silica using the Stöber method, followed by mesoporous (MS) silica using the atrane method, which offers high and conformal coating homogeneity over the clusters. Surfactant extraction was done using a simple mixture of water, ethanol, and sodium chloride - avoiding the use of other organic solvents. Finally, as a proof of concept, the loading and release of a model molecule were studied to confirm that the SPION-NCs@MS presented in this work have great potential as theranostic agents."

This study presented an innovative strategy using lignin as a mechanical reinforcement and flame-retardant synergist, combined with DMMP and EG as highly efficient flame retardants. Furthermore, the incorporation of a silica aerogel coating via surface post-treatment significantly enhanced the flame retardancy of the composite. Compared to neat RPUF, the Ct-RPUF/L/FR composites exhibited an increased LOI of 25.3 %, a delayed ignition time of 6.0 s, and reductions in total heat release (THR) and total smoke production (TSP) to 8.6 MJ/m2 and 2.11 m2, respectively, while achieving the UL-94 V-0 rating, thereby minimizing fire hazards. Additionally, the compressive strength of the composite improved from 132.4 kPa for neat RPUF to 178.3 kPa, with a thermal conductivity of only 30.11 mW/(m·K), maintaining comparable thermal insulation performance to neat RPUF. Moreover, the evidence provided by the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) indicated that the fire-retardant strategy used in this study resulted in lower environmental impact (EI) compared to traditional fire-retardant methods. This study highlighted the synergistic effects of lignin, flame retardants, and silica aerogel, providing new opportunities for the development of advanced RPUF materials with enhanced fire safety and durability, suitable for practical applications.",

      "abstract": "Gene therapy offers transformative potential for treating genetic disorders by directly addressing the molecular root causes of diseases. However, the primary challenges of gene therapy involve the efficient delivery of therapeutic genetic material to target cells, crossing biological barriers, managing toxicity and immune responses. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), due to their unique structural features have emerged as a promising platform to overcome these challenges. In recent years, MSNs have gained significant attention as potential nanocarriers for the efficient delivery of various nucleic acids. This review comprehensively examines the role of MSNs in gene therapy, focusing on their capabilities in the targeted delivery of siRNA, DNA, CRISPR-Cas systems, and other genetic therapeutics. This work explores the modern advancements in MSNs synthesis and functionalization strategies and the impact of structural modifications on their stability, cellular uptake, and controlled release under physiological conditions. Additionally, the review highlights the use of MSNs to develop theranostic systems, where gene delivery is combined with diagnostic imaging for real-time monitoring and personalized treatment strategies. Finally, this work discusses the future perspectives of MSNs in gene delivery, addressing regulatory challenges, enhancing clinical translation, and expanding their application for treating various genetic disorders and cancers."

      "abstract": "The increasing threat of multi-resistant infectious agents and environmental toxins has led to a demand for new therapeutic and catalytic materials. In this study, C-SiO₂ (crystalline silica), Ag-SiO₂ (silver-silica), and ZnO-SiO₂ (zinc oxide-silica) nanocomposites (NCs) were synthesized through green methods and characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These silica-based nanomaterials were investigated as potential photocatalysts for the degradation of p-nitroanilines and their antibacterial and antioxidant properties. XRD analysis showed crystalline sizes of 14 nm for C-SiO₂ NPs, 18 nm for Ag-SiO₂, and 20 nm for ZnO-SiO₂ NCs. UV-visible spectroscopy revealed energy band gaps of 4.5 eV for C-SiO₂ NPs, 3.23 eV for Ag-SiO₂, and 2.84 eV for ZnO-SiO₂. FTIR analysis confirmed the formation of SiO₂ in all samples through the Si-O-Si absorption peak. SEM revealed distinct morphologies: C-SiO₂ NPs as agglomerated granular particles, Ag-SiO₂ NCs as flattened rods or sheets, and ZnO-SiO₂ as roughly spherical. Antimicrobial testing showed that ZnO-SiO₂ and Ag-SiO₂ NCs exhibited 80% and 88% antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas, with Ag-SiO₂ also demonstrating strong activity against Staphylococcus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Ag-SiO₂ and ZnO-SiO₂ NCs was found to be 80%, outperforming C-SiO₂ NPs. Antioxidant activity assays showed scavenging efficiencies of 45%, 57.8%, and 71% for C-SiO₂, Ag-SiO₂, and ZnO-SiO₂ NCs, respectively, at 30 mg/ml. ZnO-SiO₂ NCs also achieved a 75% degradation rate for p-nitroanilines, while Ag-SiO₂ achieved 45%. This study demonstrates that ZnO-SiO₂ and Ag-SiO₂ NCs are effective materials for disinfection and pollutant degradation, offering an eco-friendly solution for environmental and health challenges.",

      "abstract": "Laccase from Trametes hirsuta was immobilized on amino-functionalized silica by adsorption and covalent binding using glutaraldehyde (GLA) and glyoxal (GLX) as cross-linkers. The immobilization process was optimized applying the Box-Behnken methodology. The immobilized biocatalysts were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda pore size analyses, and elemental analysis. Covalent immobilization proved to be better than adsorption based on the specific activity, immobilization yield, and stability in hospital wastewater (HWW) of the biocatalysts. The biocatalyst prepared using GLA under optimized conditions (laccase loading: 10 kU/L, pH 5, temperature: 5 °C, immobilization time: 8 h, and GLA amount: 100 mM) demonstrated better stability to pH, temperature, and other denaturants, compared to free laccase. It exhibited good catalytic potential to remove phenolic compound acetaminophen (83%) and other trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) such as mefenamic acid (86%), indomethacin (73%), carbamazepine (62%), ibuprofen (43%), naproxen (37%), and ketoprofen (27%), in a mixture from a real non-treated hospital effluent spiked with 1 µg/L of each of the above compounds. In addition, the measured catalytic parameters (Km, kcat and kcat/Km) of acetaminophen (free laccase vs. immobilized laccase (AFHMS-GLA-Lac)) are relatively similar. This is one of the first evaluative studies on different immobilization strategies using the Box-Behnken optimization method to develop efficient and stable laccase biocatalysts by immobilization on amino-functionalized silica for real hospital wastewater treatment.",

However, its current application is largely limited, with most being incinerated as waste. This study introduces a novel multi-step pre-treatment process to fractionate these components efficiently, enabling their comprehensive valorization. METHODS: The process begins with hydrothermal treatment, selectively extracting hemicellulose while preserving the structural integrity of other components. This is followed by an organosolv treatment using ethanol/water mixture, optimized to dissolve and extract organosolv lignin effectively. Subsequently, alkaline aqueous solution treatment under nitrogen atmosphere facilitates the recovery of silica as sodium silicate, a valuable industrial precursor. To ensure high-purity cellulose recovery, the final step employs alkaline hydrothermal processing under oxygen, achieving effective lignin depolymerization and removal. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Each step was carefully optimized, considering parameters such as temperature, solvent composition, and reaction time, to enhance selectivity and yield. Notably, this method reduces environmental negative impact by avoiding the use of acids while utilizing renewable solvents. The sequential application of these treatments resulted in separation exceeding 97% for hemicellulose, lignin, and silica, leaving high-purity cellulose with the loss of 22.8 wt%. Hemicellulose, organosolv lignin, and silica in the removed fractions were 66.5, 78.1, and 77.5 wt% at the first, second, and third treatments, respectively."

In this study, a novel superhydrophobic/superoleophilic chitosan-based composite was created by incorporating carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into a chitosan (CS) matrix and depositing superhydrophobic SiO2 nanoparticles, forming a sponge-like absorbent (SH-SiO2@3CNTs/CS) for selective oil absorption and efficient oil/water separation. The optimal CNTs incorporation was comprehensively investigated to enhance the structural stability and mechanical strength of the chitosan/CNTs/silica composite. The size and loading of in-situ-grown SiO2 nanoparticles on the chitosan/CNTs composite surface were identified as crucial factors in achieving surface superhydrophobicity. The optimized SH-SiO2@3CNTs/CS, with its three-dimensional porous structure, exhibited not only superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity, but also high chemical stability, excellent resistance to high temperature and friction. Notably, the SH-SiO2@3CNTs/CS composite effectively absorbed oil with a capacity of up to 18.24 times its own weight and selectively separated oil/water mixtures and water-in-oil emulsions, achieving a separation efficiency of exceeding 97 % under vacuum pump conditions. This study not only introduces a novel approach for developing superoleophilic chitosan-based sponge-like composite materials, but also presents a promising strategy for selective oil absorption and efficient separation of water-in-oil emulsions."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) is an epidemic which is increasingly prevalent among agricultural workers and nearby communities, particularly those involved in the harvest of sugarcane. While CKDu is likely multifactorial, occupational exposure to silica nanoparticles (SiNPs), a major constituent within sugarcane ash, has gained increased attention as a potential contributor. SiNPs have high potential for generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and their accumulation in kidney could result in oxidative stress induced kidney damage consistent with CKDu pathology. METHODS: In order to characterize the impact of sugarcane ash derived (SAD) SiNPs on human kidney proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) cells and identify potential mechanisms of toxicity, HK-2 cells were exposed to treatments of either pristine, manufactured, 200 nm SiNPs or SAD SiNPs and changes to cellular energy metabolism and redox state were determined. To determine how the cellular redox environment may influence PCT cell function and toxicity, the redox proteome was examined using cysteine-targeted click chemistry proteomics. RESULTS: Pristine, 200 nm SiNPs induced minimal changes to energy metabolism and proteomic profiles in vitro while treatment with SAD SiNPs resulted in mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, inhibited mitochondrial respiration, increased reactive oxygen species generation, and redox proteomic trends suggesting activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and other signaling pathways with known roles in mitochondrial inhibition and CKD progression. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that PCT cell exposure to SAD SiNPs could promote glycolytic and fibrotic shifts consistent with CKDu pathology via oxidative stress-mediated disruption of redox signaling pathways.",

However, the specific mechanism by which SiNPs cause neuroblast injury remains unclear and requires further research. This study established an in vitro experimental model of SH-SY5Y cells exposed to SiNPs and observed cell growth through an inverted fluorescence microscope. Cell viability was measured using an MTT assay. The intracellular ROS and Ca2+ levels were detected by flow cytometry. Cell apoptosis was observed using both Hoechst33342 staining and TUNEL staining. The activities of SOD and ATPase and the content of ATP in the cells were tested by biochemical methods. The genes including parp-1, aif, par, ucp2, vdac and prdx3 were explored using quantitative real-time PCR. The expressions of PARP, AIF, PAR, Caspase-3, Caspase-9 and Cyt C proteins were evaluated by Western Blot. The immunofluorescence technique was used to observe the distribution of Parthanatos-related proteins induced by SiNPs. The results showed that SiNPs reduced cell survival rate, induced excessive ROS and Ca2+ overload, decreased SOD activity, ATPase activity, intracellular and mitochondrial ATP content, increased the expression of mitochondrial function and PARP pathway related genes, as well as PARP and Caspase pathway protein expression, ultimately inducing cell apoptosis. As a further test of the roles of PARP and Caspase pathways in SiNPs induced SH-SY5Y cells death, we selected the PARP inhibitor Olaparib and Caspase inhibitor Z-VAD, and the above effects were significantly improved after treatment with the inhibitors. Conclusively, this study confirmed that SiNPs can generate excessive ROS production in SH-SY5Y cells, alter mitochondrial function, and induce cell death through Parthanatos and caspase dependent apoptotic pathways, which can coexist and interact with each other."

Despite the reported preclinical successes of MSC therapy, a major challenge in their clinical translation is a limited understanding of their biodistribution after administration. This knowledge gap needs to be addressed to allow clinical implementation. Accordingly, in this study, we propose that silica-coated gold nanoparticles (AuMS) are a promising tool for in vivo MSC tracing. This study explores the use of AuMS for both qualitative and quantitative MSC tracking in vivo after intravenous (I.V.) administration in a translational ovine model of preterm birth. Additionally, we assess the impact of AuMS labeling on the immunomodulatory functions of MSC, which play an important role in the therapeutic potency of these cells. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of AuMS-labeled MSC was performed in vivo using fluorescent microscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), respectively. AuMS localization in the liver, spleen, and lung was demonstrated. In vitro studies showed that AuMS cellular uptake occurs within 6 h and remains internalized up to 72 h. Labeled MSC maintained their immune phenotype and did not alter their immunomodulatory capacity and proliferation abilities. Overall, we demonstrate that AuMS is a promising, biocompatible nanoprobe for MSC tracing up to 72 h post-I.V. administration.",

A three-layer backward-propagating network with an ideal pattern of 5-10-1 and 4-10-1 was used to train and validate an artificial neural network (ANN) model for process modeling and optimization in batch and continuous systems, respectively. For the test dataset, the model outputs of the model pointed out a satisfactory alignment between the anticipated and experimental response. The Sg@Aln dosage and contact time were recorded as the most relevant parameters in Ni2+ elimination. The Sg@Aln-metal interactions were also characterized using a variety of instrumental approaches. The maximum Ni2+ adsorption was achieved by utilizing 2 g/L of the adsorbent at a solution pH of 5.0 after 10 min of contact time, equating to 89.11%. The data corresponded well with the non-linear shape of the Langmuir isotherm (R2 = 0.99), and the computed maximal adsorption capacity was 96.01 mg/g (1.64 × 10-3 mol/g) at 25 °C. Kinetic analysis reveals that the adsorption process is consistent with the pseudo-second-order model, with R2 = 0.9998. Thermodynamic findings indicated endothermicity, spontaneity, and adsorption favorability. Sg@Aln could remove 41.23 mg/g and 33.20 mg/g of Ni2+ from actual wastewater in batch and continuous processes, respectively. While the Sg@Aln column's breakthrough curve is consistent with Chu's simplistic model, the breakthrough capacity was 69.35 mg/g. Overall, the results might open new possibilities for treating metal pollution in the aquatic environment.",

This study examined the effects of various types of fluorescent defects, their brightness, and surface treatments on laser-induced damage. The results indicate that the probability of damage is contingent upon the type, brightness of fluorescent defects, and the laser radiation flux. Specifically, at a radiation flux exceeding 20 J/cm2, all fluorescent defects were found to induce damage. However, at a radiation flux of 12 J/cm2, the damage probability of fluorescent defects in precision polished optics was just approximately 25%. Following dynamic chemical etching (DCE) treatment, the damage probability was further reduced to 6%, and the proportion of fluorescent defects among all damage points decreased from 6% prior to DCE treatment to 2%. These results suggest that the majority of damage precursors on the precision polished surface of fused silica optics lack photoluminescent characteristics. Furthermore, the surface defect modification resulting from DCE treatment appears to enhance the non-photoluminescent characteristics of the damage precursors."

HMSNs can achieve high efficiency, targeting, and controlled release by adjusting the microstructure and surface modification of its particles, which makes it broad application prospects in the field of medical therapy, especially in cancer therapy. Numerous studies have shown that preparation method, shape, particle size, hollow inner diameter, aperture and wall thickness of the HMSNs, the characteristics of the drugs, the interaction between the drugs and the carriers, and the external environment all closely affect the drug delivery, release, and efficacy. The external environment includes temperature, pH value, light intensity, magnetic field intensity, enzyme type and concentration, etc. This review summarizes the research progress of HMSNs as carrier materials in the past five years, analyzes the existing problems in the application process and presents the development prospects of HMSNs.",

      "abstract": "To expand the applications of hydrophobic silica aerogels derived from rice husk ash (HSA) through simple traditional methods (without adding special materials or processes), this paper employs machine learning to establish mathematical models to identify optimal conditions for extracting water glass and investigates how preparation conditions and heat treatment temperatures affect properties such as the porosity and hydrophobicity of HSA. The results indicate that the decision tree regression model provides the most accurate predictions for the extraction rate and modulus of water glass. Notably, the water contact angle of HSA produced using nitric acid as a catalyst can reach as high as 159.5°, classifying it as a superhydrophobic material. Additionally, while moderately increasing the concentration of the hydrophobic modifier enhances HSA's hydrophobicity, it concurrently reduces its porosity. The HSA maintained hydrophobicity until 500 °C. The pore structure of HSA collapsed gradually with the increase in heat temperature. After treatment at 700 °C, HSA lost its hydrophobicity and the porous structure was severely damaged. Compared with silica aerogel using traditional silicon sources, the damage to pore structure and the crystallization occurred at lower temperatures, but the hydrophobicity remained at higher temperatures."

      "abstract": "The limited membrane permeability and bacterial resistance pose significant challenges in the management of intracellular drug-resistant bacterial infections. To overcome this issue, we developed a bacterial-targeted drug delivery system based on quaternary ammonium chitosan-modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN-NH2-CFP@HACC) for the treatment of intracellular Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. This system utilizes amino-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles to efficiently load cefoperazone (CFP), and the nanoparticles' surface is coated with 2-hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride chitosan (HACC) to target bacteria and enhance macrophage uptake. The findings indicate that MSN-NH2-CFP@HACC nanoparticles are efficiently internalized by macrophages, demonstrate accelerated drug release in acidic environments, and exhibit enhanced antibacterial properties, effectively suppressing the proliferation and intracellular escape of MRSA. Moreover, HACC enhances the bacterial capture ability of the nanoparticles and reduces resistance by disrupting bacterial membrane structures and inhibiting bacterial β-lactamase activity. In a murine model of MRSA bacteremia, MSN-NH2-CFP@HACC exhibited remarkable antibacterial efficacy and significantly attenuated severe inflammatory responses. In conclusion, MSN-NH2-CFP@HACC represent a promising antibiotic delivery system with exceptional antibacterial efficacy and favorable biocompatibility, thus presenting a novel strategy for addressing intracellular drug-resistant bacterial infections and demonstrating significant potential for clinical application.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the interactions between lipid membranes and nucleotide drugs is crucial for nucleic acid therapy. Although several methods have been employed to evaluate nucleotide-lipid membrane interactions, these interactions can be complex; this complexity arises from how external factors, such as ionic strength or temperature, influence the lipid membrane's overall properties. In this study, we prepared a lipid membrane-immobilized monolithic silica (LMiMS) column for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis to understand interactions between the lipid membrane and nucleic acid. First, the Raman shift, zeta potential, fluidity, and polarity of the LMiMS-column membrane were analyzed and compared to dispersed liposomes (not immobilized) with the same lipid composition. The results indicated that the column can effectively imitate the temperature-dependent properties of the lipid membrane, suggesting that the immobilized lipid membrane can be used as a model of dispersed liposomal membranes. Subsequently, HPLC was performed to analyze the interaction between the lipid membrane and oligonucleotides. The retention factor k was determined as an interaction factor between the LMiMS column and nucleic acid models (poly 10, 25, and 50mer dC) at various temperatures and mobile phase salt concentrations. The results revealed that changes in membrane interaction were significant by the phase state and salt concentration. Further analysis of the retention factor k showed that the interaction is weak below the phase transition temperature but strong above the phase transition temperature. The results indicate that membrane properties (rigidity and polarity) are also related to membrane interaction, which can be evaluated with the LMiMS column. This analytical method can provide a new perspective on estimating the interactions between target molecules and the lipid membrane through their temperature-induced dynamics. From these results, our method could be useful for analyzing lipid membrane-oligonucleotide interactions.",

By batch experiment method to investigate the ZA/SiO2 adsorption of Cu(II) and Cr(VI) solution treatment effect. The sorption kinetics curves of Cu(II) and Cr(VI) on ZA/SiO2 were L-shaped. What's more, the solid concentration effect was found in the process of sorption kinetics. Langmuir and Freundlich sorption isotherm models were used to analyze the adsorption data. The results showed that the adsorption conforms to Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models. However, the adsorption capacity of ZA/SiO2 compounds for Cu(II) and Cr(VI) is greatly improved. The adsorption capacity of Cu(II) is 158 mg·g-1 and of Cr(VI) is 176 mg·g-1, which were 3.6 and 1.8 times of ZnAl-LDHs (ZA), respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) was utilized for the analysis of intrinsic mechanism and specific pathways. The primary mechanism for removing Cr(VI) from water mainly included the intercalation of Cr2O72- and exchange between Cr2O72- and OH-, excluding Cr(OH)3 precipitation. Regarding the primary mechanism for eliminating Cu(II) from water, it involves isomorphic substitution as the predominant process, except for the formation of Cu(OH)2 precipitates."

It is an emerging first-line treatment agent for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there is no intravenous ad-ministration of Lenvatinib. AIMS: This study aimed to construct nanocomposites that can efficiently support Lenvatinib and target liver cancer tissues and cells. OBJECTIVE: In this study, ferric oxide-viral-like mesoporous silica nanoparticles-folic acid (Fe3O4-vMSN-FA) nanocomposites loaded with Lenvatinib were constructed, and their anti-hepatocellular carcinoma effects were evaluated. METHODS: The hydrothermal method was used to synthesize ferric oxide (Fe3O4). Ferric ox-ide-viral-like mesoporous silica nanoparticles (Fe3O4-vMSN) were synthesized using a two-phase method. Then, Fe3O4-vMSN was modified with folic acid (Fe3O4-vMSN-FA) to better target tumor cells. RESULTS: The experimental data showed that Fe3O4-vMSN-FA nanocomposites were suc-cessfully synthesized and could be loaded with Lenvatinib (Len@ Fe3O4-vMSN-FA). Fe3O4-vMSN-FA had good stability and biocompatibility, and it can release the loaded Len-vatinib faster in an acidic environment (pH 5.5). CCK8 assay and flow cytometry showed that HepG2 cells in the Len@ Fe3O4-vMSN group had the lowest cell viability and the high-est apoptosis rate, confirming the anticancer properties of Len@ Fe3O4-vMSN-FA in vitro. In addition, transwell experiments showed that the migration and invasion ability of HepG2 cells in the Len@ Fe3O4-vMSN-FA group were significantly inhibited. In vivo fluorescence imaging in mice confirmed the enhanced tumor-targeting ability of Fe3O4-vMSN-FA. The tumor volume of the Len@ Fe3O4-vMSN-FA group was significantly reduced, and there was no significant effect on body weight. Moreover, serum liver function index (ALT and AST) and HE staining showed that Len@ Fe3O4-vMSN-FA did not cause obvious damage to organ tissue. CONCLUSION: Len@ Fe3O4-vMSN-FA has a good anti-liver cancer effect. Fe3O4-vMSN-FA can be used as an alternative platform for MSCs for drug delivery, providing more options for cancer therapy."

Although the conversion and enantiomeric excess (e.e.) could reach to 78.2 % and 99 %, respectively, ionic liquid as an additive was required to improve the permeability of cell membrane. To further simplify the reaction, the molecular docking and saturation mutagenesis technology were used here to obtain an activity-improved yhdN variant such as G19A. And then, both excellent conversion and e.e. of 99 % for (S)-NEMCA-HEPE could be achieved within 40 min by using only G19A-GDH whole cell as a catalyst without any additive. However, the use of the whole cells still faces the issues of poor operation stability and adverse application prospect. Subsequently, a hydrophobic \"cell-in-shell\" complex of G19A-GDH@O-Silica was constructed by using a silica nanocoated technology. The obtained G19A-GDH@O-Silica exhibited an excellent conversion towards the asymmetric carbonyl reduction, and a good tolerance in changing thermal, pH, and storage environmental. Giving 76.3 % of reaction conversion even after the 11th cycle of reuse, indicated that G19A-GDH@O-Silica also possessed ideal recyclability. The aim of this study is to provide a rapid, and cost-effective nanocoated whole-cell biocatalyst for efficient preparation of (S)-NEMCA-HEPE. The simplicity and robustness of the immobilization approach may become a powerful tool to utilize whole-cell catalysts towards organic catalysis.",

      "abstract": "The efficient removal of dyes is of significant importance for environmental purification and human health. In this study, a novel material (Si-MPTS-IL) has been synthesized by the immobilization of imidazole ionic liquids (ILs) onto nano-silica using the radiation grafting technique. The adsorption performance of Si-MPTS-IL for Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) removal is studied by a series of static adsorption experiments. It is found that Si-MPTS-IL has ultra-fast adsorption kinetics, reaching equilibrium within 2 min. The adsorption process for CBB conforms to the Langmuir model. In addition, Si-MPTS-IL exhibits a negligible impact on the adsorption efficiency of CBB with the increase in salt concentration. After six cycles of adsorption-desorption, the adsorption efficiency of Si-MPTS-IL remained above 80%, indicating excellent regenerative properties and a promising candidate for the treatment of wastewater containing CBB. A study of the mechanism indicates that the CBB capture by Si-MPTS-IL can be attributed to the synergistic effects of electrostatic interactions and pore filling."

      "abstract": "Occupational exposures to respirable dusts and respirable crystalline silica (RCS) is well established as a health hazard in many industries including mining, construction, and oil and gas extraction. The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is researching methods of controlling fugitive dust emissions at outdoor mining operations. In this study, a prototype engineering control system to control fugitive dust emissions was developed combining passive subsystems for dust settling with active dust filtration and spray-surfactant dust suppression comprising a hybrid system. The hybrid system was installed at an aggregate production facility to evaluate the effectiveness of controlling fugitive dust emissions generated from two cone crushers and belt conveyors that transport crushed materials. To evaluate effectiveness of the system, area air measurements (n = 14 on each day for a total of 42 samples) for respirable dust were collected by NIOSH before, during, and after the installation of the dust control system in the immediate vicinity of the crushers and the nearby conveyor transfer point. Compared to pre-intervention samples, over short periods of time, geometric mean concentrations of airborne respirable dust were reduced by 37% using passive controls (p = 0.34) but significantly reduced by 93% (p < 0.0001) when the full hybrid system was installed. This proof-of-concept project demonstrated that the combined use of active and passive dust controls along with a spray surfactant can be highly effective in controlling fugitive dust emissions even with minimal use of water, which is desirable for many remote mining applications."

      "abstract": "Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of mortality globally. Nanotechnology-mediated targeted drug delivery approach is one of the promising strategies for the treatment of lung cancer. Due to their multifactorial role, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), have attracted a lot of attention for drug delivery. The emerging dual-drug co-delivery approach has drawn much attention due to circumventing various drug-resistant mechanisms in tumor cells. Further, functionalization of si-RNA (survivin) to the dual drugs (etoposide plus carfilzomib) or (docetaxel plus carfilzomib) loaded MSNs can be a potential tool to inhibit gene expression specifically. In the present study, we investigated the comparative therapeutic efficacy of co-delivered anticancer drugs functionalized with survivin siRNA in MSNs for lung cancer. According to our findings, this kind of combination therapy has inhibited the function of the survivin protein while promoting increased therapeutic efficacy due to synergistic pharmacological activity, and found si-RNA- (etoposide plus carfilzomib) to be a better candidate for lung cancer treatment in the future."

However, limitations such as relatively low thermal stability and moisture sensitivity restrict its application as a super engineering plastic. In this study, amide groups are incorporated into the PBI backbone to synthesize the copolymer poly(BI-co-A), effecting a structural modification at the molecular level. Additionally, silica nanospheres were composited into the poly(BI-co-A) film to further enhance its thermal performance. The resulting composite films exhibited remarkable thermal stability, with the temperature for 10% weight loss reaching as high as 761 °C. To address increased water absorption due to the high hydrophilicity of hydroxyl groups on the silica nanospheres' surface, a dehydration treatment was applied in an electric furnace. This treatment produced a highly thermoresistant poly(BI-co-A) nanocomposite film with reduced wettability, making it suitable for applications in humid environments."

      "abstract": "Medicinal plants are increasingly being explored due to their possible pharmacological properties and minimal adverse effects. However, low bioavailability and stability often limit efficacy, necessitating high oral doses to achieve therapeutic levels in the bloodstream. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) offer a potential solution to these limitations. Due to their large surface area, substantial pore volume, and ability to precisely control pore size. MSNs are also capable of efficiently incorporating a wide range of therapeutic substances, including herbal plant extracts, leading to potential use for drug containment and delivery systems. Therefore, this review aimed to discuss and summarize the successful developments of herbal plant extracts loaded into MSN, focusing on preparation, characterization, and the impact on efficacy. Data were collected from publications on Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases using the precise keywords \"mesoporous silica nanoparticle\" and \"herbal extract\". The results showed that improved phytoconstituent bioavailability, modified release profiles, increased stability, reduced dose and toxicity are the primary benefits of this method. This review offers insights on the significance of integrating MSNs into therapeutic formulations to improve pharmacological characteristics and effectiveness of medicinal plant extracts. Future prospects show favorable potential for therapeutic applications using MSNs combined with herbal medicines for clinical therapy."

This paper describes a new, simplified UV-vis spectroscopy-based procedure for monitoring the adsorption of color compounds in tequila vinasses onto silica-based adsorbents, along with an optimized synthesis method to produce the most efficient sol-gel synthesized thiol-functionalized adsorbent. Under optimized conditions, the uptake capacity of this adsorbent reaches 0.8 g g-1 in 90 min. Experimental results demonstrate that the adsorbent has a specific affinity for melanoidin-type molecules. The adsorbent demonstrates excellent thermal stability (~316 °C). The results of this work indicate that the adsorbent possesses potential in the treatment of tequila vinasses from wastewater discharges."

      "abstract": "We report the design and development of a novel multifunctional nanostructure, RB-AuSiO2_HSA-DOX, where tri-modal cancer treatment strategies-photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT), chemotherapy-luminescent properties and targeting are integrated into the same scaffold. It consists of a gold core with optical and thermo-plasmonic properties and is covered by a silica shell entrapping a well-known photosensitizer and luminophore, Rose Bengal (RB). The nanoparticle surface was decorated with Human Serum Albumin (HSA) through a covalent conjugation to confer its targeting abilities and as a carrier of Doxorubicin (DOX), one of the most effective anticancer drugs in clinical chemotherapy. The obtained nanostructure was fully characterized through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and UV-visible spectroscopy, with a homogeneous and spherical shape, an average diameter of about 60 nm and negative ζ-potential value Singlet oxygen generation and photothermal properties were explored under green light irradiation. The interaction between DOX-HSA anchored on the nanoplatform was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy and compared to that of DOX-HSA, pointing out different accessibility of the drug molecules to the HSA binding sites, whether the protein is free or bound to the nanoparticle surface. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies comparing a drug-HSA interaction with that of the same protein anchored to nanoparticles. Furthermore, the uptake of RB-AuSiO2_HSA-DOX into MDA-MB-231 mammary cells was assessed by confocal imaging, highlighting-at early time of incubation and as demonstrated by the increased DOX luminescence displayed within cells-a better internalization of the carried anticancer drug compared to the free one, making the obtained nanostructure a suitable and promising platform for an anticancer multimodal approach.",

      "abstract": "The amount of incorporation of linear alcohols and ethers in H4SiW12O40·6H2O (HSiW·6H2O, 50 wt %) supported on silica (SiO2) was estimated by a conventional volumetric method and infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and the state of involved molecules was elucidated. First, the attribution of the key IR band at 2200 cm-1, which was observed for the water of crystallization of HSiW·6H2O, to H5O2+ species (protons) was verified by coincident observation of thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and IR spectroscopy during thermal treatment in addition to the isotope exchange with D2O. The 2200 cm-1 band was gradually decreased in intensity by increasing the amount of adsorption of pyridine and was totally consumed at saturation, while the volumetric method provided the accurate number of included pyridine molecules. Thus, the decrease of the integrated intensity of the 2200 cm-1 band was employed to evaluate the extent of interaction of linear alcohols and ethers with H5O2+ species in equilibrium and irreversible conditions at room temperature. Linear alcohols (C1-C5) consumed almost all protons in equilibrium and about 50% in evacuation at room temperature, while about a half of protons were interacted in equilibrium and a quarter in evacuation in the case of dimethyl and diethyl ethers. Knowing the number of molecules incorporated and the amount of H5O2+ species consumed, the ratio of interacted molecules and H5O2+ species was estimated as H5O2+:molecules = 1:2-3. XRD patterns indicated the copresence of molecule-incorporated and molecule-free domains under irreversible conditions. Therefore, the incorporated molecules were concentrated around the H5O2+ species in HSiW·6H2O crystals. The state of absorbed molecules in HSiW·6H2O crystals was presumed by IR spectra: the presence of Fermi resonance of the hydrogen-bonded OH stretching band of H5O2+ species with CH deformation bands of interacted molecules implied the equilibrium state of as-interacted molecules and protonated species (transition state) at room temperature."

This study evaluates in vitro protoscolicidal activity of piperine-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (PIP-MSNs) against protoscoleces of Echinococcus granulosus. MSNs were prepared by adding tetraethyl orthosilicate to cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and NaOH, and then loaded with PIP. The mean particle size and hydrodynamic diameter of MSNs were determined at 68 ± 4.5 and 101.4 ± 50.4 nm using transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering, respectively. X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared analysis, and UV-spectrophotometry confirmed drug loading. Drug loading efficiency and drug loading capacity were calculated at 60% and 18%, respectively. The drug release profile confirmed a 75% PIP release plateau after about 24 h. The cytotoxicity assay showed cell viability > 90% in all concentrations used (≤ 512 µg/mL). E. granulosus protoscoleces were exposed to PIP-MSNs and their viability was assessed using the eosin exclusion test. In a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.001), exposure to 375 and 500 µg/mL of PIP-MSNs for 180 min killed 89.67 and 94.67% of protoscoleces, respectively. This study introduces PIP-MSNs as a potential protoscolicidal agent in the treatment of CE. Further studies are necessary to uncover safety aspects, biodistribution patterns, and potential combination therapies.",
