      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Particular attention is given to the enhancement of melanin-related pigmentation (dark circles, photoaging) and vascular circles, which are commonly located in the tear trough. The objective of the study is to provide an objective evaluation of the impact of carboxytherapy and the treatment regimen combining carboxytherapy with lactobionic acid (20%, pH 2.1) or ferulic acid (14%, pH 4.0-5.0) and ascorbic acid (12%) on skin defects in the eye area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A group of 39 Caucasian people were subjected to a series of five carboxytherapy treatments (right eye area) and five treatments combining carboxytherapy with a selected chemical peel for the skin around the eyes (left eye area). The efficacy of therapy was assessed based on parameters (MI and EI) measured with the Mexameter probe. Measurements were made in the tear trough and the middle of the lower eyelid. RESULTS: We demonstrated that a series of carboxytherapy (right side) significantly statistically influenced the EI parameter (in different measurement points: P <0.0001, P = 0.015, P = 0.002), which reflects the intensity of vascular circles under the eyes. Improvement of this parameter by 7.2 units was also shown in the tear trough in 82.1% of participants after the application of carboxytherapy combined with acids (left side) on the valley of tears for this parameter (EI). Lactobionic acid and carboxytherapy were associated with a statistically significant improvement (P = 0.011) in the tear trough. In this study, a reduction in the combined pigmentation (MI plus EI) for both the right and left sides (p = 0.001 and p = 0.015, respectively) was observed. CONCLUSION: The study provides objective evidence for the effectiveness of sole carboxytherapy and carboxytherapy combined with acids in the reduction of dark circles, in particular vascular circles in the tear trough. Lactobionic acid, ferulic acid, and ascorbic acid can be used as safe supplements to enhance carboxytherapy."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 39 Caucasian patients were subjected to a series of five combination carboxytherapy and chemical peels treatments at weekly intervals. The Cutometer device was used to objectively measure skin elasticity. The assessment was supplemented by photographic documentation. RESULTS: A statistically significant improvement in skin elasticity assessed on the basis of R2 and R7 parameters (p < .0001, p = .001, respectively) was demonstrated after a series of five sessions of carboxytherapy combined with chemical peels. The improvement in the R2 parameter was observed in 82.1%, while R7 in 76.9% of study participants. It observed that the number of participants who benefited from treatment with ferulic acid and ascorbic acid was statistically higher compared with the second group (p = .036). Improved R2 values were reported in 100% of participants undergoing carboxytherapy combined with ferulic and ascorbic acid. CONCLUSION: Carboxytherapy in combination with chemical peels improved skin elasticity and can be used to reduce other skin defects.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There has been a proliferation of physicians of different levels of experience and training offering nonsurgical cosmetic procedures. Rising demand, compounded by increasing utilization of new and existing technologies by numerous physician specialties, compels discussion of adequate standardized training and patient safety. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients who presented to our single site dermatology clinic for managment of complications following chemical peel, laser or energy-based device treatments performed by core cosmetic physicians between the years of 2013 and 2024 was conducted. Core cosmetic physicians included plastic surgery, facial surgery/otolaryngology, oculoplastic surgery, and dermatology. Charts were reviewed for documentation of the type of complication, procedure causing the complication, and physician credentials, and referral source. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were identified as having complications from chemical peeling, laser treatment or energy-based devices. Devices implicated included CO2 laser (fractional or fully ablative), chemical peels, 1064 nm long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser, 1320 nm Nd:YAG laser, intense pulsed light, 595 nm pulsed dye laser, Q-switched Nd:YAG laser, radiofrequency with and without microneedling, and 1550 nm erbium-doped fiber laser. Complications included hypertrophic scarring, atrophic scarring, post-inflammatory erythema, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and post-inflammatory hypopigmentation. CONCLUSIONS: Even in experienced hands, complications can arise. It is imperative that all physicians offering cosmetic treatments are equipped to recognize clinical endpoints, identify and manage complications, or make a timely referral to decrease the risk of a permanent and potentially devastating esthetic outcome for patients.",

      "abstract": "Acne vulgaris stands out as the most prevalent skin disorder among teenagers and young adults, causing physical discomfort and considerable economic and psychological burdens on individuals and society. A wide range of topical and systemic therapies are available in acne treatment. Chemical peeling is a skin resurfacing technique designed to rebuild healthy skin using exfoliating substances, a simple and affordable process with various dermatological uses. Chemical peels, classified as superficial, medium, and deep, have been utilized for acne vulgaris and multiple other skin issues. In these chemical peels, a diverse range of chemical substances is employed, each with its unique mode of action. Among these, α-hydroxy and β-hydroxy acids have gathered attention for their efficacy in reducing acne lesions and enhancing overall skin appearance. Acids, such as salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or lactic acid, are commonly used in chemical peels due to their exfoliating and sebum-regulating properties. Despite the widespread use of these acids, there exists a lack of consensus regarding the most effective acid type and concentration for treating acne-prone skin. This review aims to bridge this knowledge gap by evaluating the effectiveness and safety of various organic acids used in chemical peels specifically for acne-prone skin. The findings of this comprehensive bibliographic review indicate that organic acid-based chemical peels represent effective and safe treatment options for individuals with acne-prone skin. Their adaptability sets these treatments apart; the choice of organic acid can be tailored to meet individual patient needs and tolerability levels. This personalized approach ensures that patients receive optimal care while minimizing the risks associated with the treatment. As research in this field progresses, it is anticipated that a more nuanced understanding of the ideal acid type and concentration will emerge, further enhancing the efficacy and safety of chemical peels for acne-prone skin.",

Chemical peels for the nails may provide a solution to improve nail appearance. We reviewed articles that assessed the efficacy of using chemical peels for the nails. METHODS: Searches on PubMed were performed to identify studies that discussed the use of chemical peels on the nail published up to July 2022. RESULTS: A total of 4 studies with a total of 96 patients were found involving the use of chemical peels for the nail. It was found that there was marked improvement in aesthetic appearance for nail surface abnormalities induced by cosmetics. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Studies with larger sample sizes that compare the efficacy of doses, treatment length, and a standardized method to assess results are needed to determine best treatment protocol. Chemical peels for the nails may provide fast improvement of the appearance of the nail and be utilized as a supportive treatment in association with specific treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris (AV) is a common skin disease. Fire needle is a method of quickly piercing the local skin lesions with red-hot needles for AV. This work aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fire needle combined with chemical peels for AV. METHODS: Eight databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Internet, Wanfang, Sinomed, and VIP databases were searched to enrolled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fire needle therapy combined with chemical peels with chemical peels alone. The risk of bias was evaluated by the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Statistical analysis was completed by RevMan 5.3 and Stata 14.0. RESULTS: Altogether 18 studies including 1213 patients were enrolled. Compared with chemical peels alone, fire needle adjuvant chemical peels therapy improved the total effective rate (RR = 1.37,95% CI [1.26,1.48], p < 0.00001) and skin lesions (MD = -2.11, 95% CI [-2.74, -1.47], p < 0.00001), and reduced the recurrence rate (RR  = 0.50,95% CI [0.33,0.76], p = 0.0009).The application of fire needle was associated with few adverse reactions, all of which were well tolerated and transient. CONCLUSION: Fire needle adjuvant chemical peels therapy is effective and safe for AV. Nevertheless, more large-scale, well-designed clinical studies are warranted to provide evidence-based medical support.",

The penetration of active substances can be enhanced by microneedle mesotherapy. The study was conducted on a group of 20 female volunteers, aged 40-65 years. All volunteers received a series of eight treatments performed every seven days. The whole face was first treated with azelaic acid; following this, the right side received a 40% solution of vitamin C and the left side 10% vitamin C with microneedling. Hydration and skin elasticity were markedly improved, with better results observed on the microneedling side. Melanin and erythema index decreased. No significant side effects were seen. The combination of active ingredients and delivery techniques have great potential to enhance the effectiveness of cosmetic preparations, probably by multidirectional ways of action. In our study, we demonstrated that both 20% azelaic acid + 40% vitamin C treatment and 20% azelaic acid + 10% vitamin C + microneedle mesotherapy efficiently improved the assessed parameters of aging skin. However, the use of microneedling mesotherapy as a means of direct delivery of active compound to the dermis enhanced the effectiveness of the studied preparation."

Taking minocycline risks inducing skin pigmentation. If minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation is not treated, it may take months to years for the symptoms to subside after discontinuation of the drug, or the hyperpigmentation may never disappear completely, which can lead to cosmetic anxiety and affect people's quality of life. Previous treatment options for hyperpigmentation were mainly q-switched nd: YAG, ruby, and alexandrite lasers. This article reports a case of facial hyperpigmentation caused by minocycline using a combination of chemical peel and intense pulsed light in a patient with eosinophilic cellulitis (Wells syndrome) who was taking oral minocycline. This case suggests combining chemical peel and intense pulsed light is an effective treatment option for minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation."

Prolonged erythema is one complication of this procedure. We report the prevalence and probable etiology of prolonged facial erythema in a cohort of patients treated with medium-depth chemical peels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective audit was conducted of all medium-depth facial chemical peels performed at two major teaching hospitals. All patients had severe facial photodamage affecting at least 75% surface area of the face. The occurrence of prolonged erythema following this peel was then identified and analyzed. RESULTS: Of our treatment cohort (n = 82, 51 women, 31 men) with 60 years mean (61.3 years for women, 56.7 years for men), 10 patients (12%; eight women, two men) experienced prolonged erythema beyond a month of treatment. Facial psoriasis was not apparent at the time of chemical peel but manifested as prolonged erythema beyond the expected timeframe following the procedure. CONCLUSION: When patients experience prolonged erythema beyond a month of treatment and fail to respond to standard treatments, clinicians should examine carefully for extra-facial psoriasis prior to this procedure, and also consider facial psoriasis a possible cause of prolonged post-peel erythema.",

With this growth, we have also seen an influx of patients of differing ethnicities, in all varying shades of color. Some clinicians may not have the necessary knowledge and skill to appropriately treat these patients using modalities such as laser therapy, microneedling, and chemical peels. The aesthetic industry provides courses, conferences, and educational guides for helping aesthetic practitioners determine which patients are eligible to undergo these treatments. However, there is a considerable lack of information available for clinicians about treatment modalities that can be safely and effectively used on patients with Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI. As the population of patients of various ethnic origins seeking aesthetic treatments continues to grow, it is imperative for clinicians performing these treatments to increase their knowledge and skill related to treating patients with skin of color. The purpose of this article is to educate aesthetic clinicians about appropriate treatments, procedures, and protocols for preventing adverse reactions in patients with skin of color who are undergoing aesthetic treatments using lasers, microneedling, and chemical peels.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acne is one of the most commonly faced dermatological complaints in our day-to-day practice. Among the various treatment modalities for acne and postacne pigmentation, chemical peeling is a promising and emerging treatment modality. Although various peeling agents are available, there is a lack of research comparing their efficacy. In addition, only a few studies have compared the efficacy of combined peels in the South Indian population. The present study aimed to compare the efficacy of alpha and beta hydroxy acid peels in the treatment of postacne pigmentation. METHODS: Forty patients with postacne pigmentation were divided into two groups of 20 patients each. Patients were randomized into one of the two treatment groups consecutively based on block randomization technique with block size 4. Patients of GA peel group was treated with 50% glycolic acid (GA) and the salicylic acid (SA) peel group was treated with 30% salicylic acid. The procedure was repeated every two weeks up to six weeks and the primary outcome was assessed every two weeks. The assessment with photographic documentation was done by a blinded evaluator from our department of dermatology. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 21±2.29 years. Out of 40 patients, 24 were females and 16 were males. GA and SA peel groups showed significant improvement from first follow-up onwards in the study. However, GA peel showed higher percentage of postacne pigmentation reduction than SA peel in all the four follow-ups. In GA peel group, >75% reduction in postacne pigmentation was observed in 45 percent of the patients. Whereas in the SA peel group, none of the patients achieved >75% reduction of postacne pigmentation. Pairwise comparison between both groups were statistically significant (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the GA peel was more effective than SA peel in improving postacne pigmentation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chemical peels are an integral part of dermatology practice for the treatment of acne, photoaging, and pigmentary dyschromias. Oral isotretinoin is considered the gold standard in the management of acne. Combining both is not currently recommended, due to the increased risk of complications like dryness, erythema, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and scarring. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the safety and efficacy of superficial chemical peels in patients with acne taking isotretinoin and those not taking oral isotretinoin. METHODS: A comparative, retrospective analysis of three superficial chemical peels was performed; the analysis included 60 patients and 214 sessions that took place between August 2017 and January 2018. Of these, 47 patients were on oral isotretinoin (Group A) and 13 were not on isotretinoin (Group B). In Group A, a salicylic acid-mandelic acid peel (SMP) was performed on 22 patients, a glycolic acid peel was performed on 18 patients, and a modified Jessner's peel was performed on seven patients. In Group B, an SMP on eight, glycolic acid peel on four, and modified Jessner's peel on one patient(s), respectively, were performed. Complications, if any, were noted, and incidence rates were compared by photographic assessment. RESULTS: One patient in Group A and one patient in Group B had complications (persistent hyperpigmentation). The difference in the incidence of complications was insignificant between the two groups for all three superficial peels. Furthermore, it was noticed that patients in the isotretinoin group experienced faster and better improvement compared to those in the non-isotretinoin group. CONCLUSION: In our study, the use of isotretinoin did not result in any complications; hence, we encourage combination therapy to achieve enhanced and faster resolution of acne."

The aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) versus its combination with subcision or medium-depth peeling (glycolic acid 70% followed by trichloroacetic acid [TCA] 35%) for SD treatment. Seventy-five female patients with SD were divided into three equal groups with the contralateral side in each patients represented the control group. Group A treated with PRP, group B received PRP + subcision while group C received PRP + combined peeling (GA 70% + TCA 35%). Primary outcome included clinical improvement, patients' satisfaction, and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Striae measurement, skin biopsies were also assessed. Very much improvement was achieved in 28%, 44%, and 36% in groups A, B, and C respectively. The combined groups (B and C) showed significantly higher patients' satisfaction and DLQI than group A (p = 0.03), (p < 0.0001). A significant decrease in all striae measurements was achieved with all groups (p < 0.001); however, groups B and C showed more decrease (p = 0.2 and 0.4). A highly significant decrease in the mean number of sessions was found in group B (p < 0.0001). All groups demonstrated improvement in dermal collagen deposition, which was higher in the combined groups. Side effects were mild and well tolerated. The combination of PRP with subcision or peeling was more effective and offered a higher therapeutic response than PRP alone. Moreover, the subcision has superior efficacy in striae albae and safer in darker skin types.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed was performed searching from 1946 to March 2020 to identify the literature on chemical peels for AKs. RESULTS: Of the 151 articles identified, 5 met inclusion criteria for review. Four of the reviewed articles demonstrated the efficacy of chemical peels in reducing AK count and minimal adverse effects. In some studies, chemical peels exhibited potential to prevent additional AK formation and development of keratinocyte carcinomas. CONCLUSION: Chemical peels are an efficacious and affordable treatment option for field treatment of AKs. With improved patient tolerance and adherence, chemical peels are an attractive option for field therapy of AKs for both dermatologists and patients.",

The treatment of PPR is challenging due to the unclear and complex pathogenesis. In the present retrospective study, patients with PPR treated with oral minocycline and supramolecular salicylic acid (SSA) 30% chemical peels enrolled between June 2018 and June 2019 were evaluated. All patients were treated with 50 mg minocycline twice a day and SSA 30% twice a month. A total of 19 patients were enrolled and all received the therapy for 12 weeks. A significant reduction of rosacea severity was observed by Investigator Severity Assessment (ISA) after treatment; the mean score reduced from 3.32±0.6 at baseline to 0.89±0.7 (P<0.01) at 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, all patients achieved at least a 'moderate response' and 17 patients (89.47%) obtained 'excellent improvement' in the Investigator Global Assessment of efficacy. No obvious adverse reactions were observed during each patient's visit. In conclusion, the combination treatment of minocycline and SSA 30% was an effective therapy for PPR. The limitation of the present study was that it was a retrospective analysis; more high-quality, prospective, blinded, controlled clinical trials are required to evaluate the efficacy based on the current study."

The Modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) score was calculated at baseline (before starting peeling sessions), after one month (at the fourth TCA peeling session), and after three months (one month after the last TCA peeling session). Both sides of the face showed gradual reduction in modified MASI score throughout sessions. By the end of the study, the TCA-treated side showed slightly lower mean modified MASI score than the combined chemical peels-treated side of the face; however this difference was not statistically significant, (p = .405). A single session of combined chemical peels is as effective as six sessions of TCA peel in treatment of melasma. Combined chemical peels can be used as a convenient, tolerable and time saving safe procedure for treating melasma.",

      "abstract": "Background: Chemexfoliation is widely used to reverse signs of photodamage. Although photodamage can eventually lead to skin cancer, it remains unclear whether chemical peels also affect photocarcinogenesis. Moreover, concerns about the systemic and/or cutaneous toxicity of peeling agents have already arisen. Objective: This review sought primarily to summarize the data available on the effects of chemical peels on ultraviolet-induced skin carcinogenesis, focusing particular attention on actinic keratoses and cutaneous field cancerization. In addition, considerations about the systemic and/or cutaneous toxicity of peeling agents, particularly trichloracetic acid, are briefly discussed. Methods: The PubMed, MEDLINE, and SCOPUS databases were searched using the keywords \"chemical peeling,\" \"actinic keratosis,\" \"cutaneous field cancerization,\" \"skin cancer,\" \"skin cancer prevention,\" and \"cutaneous and systemic carcinogenicity,\" both alone and in combination with one another. Additional relevant references were also isolated from citations in the reviewed literature. Results: A total of 42 articles involving both in-vitro and in-vivo human and animal models were included for analysis. The data were mainly confined to laboratory animals. Conclusion: Apart from efficacy in clearing visible actinic keratoses, the findings point towards the possible clinical use of chemical peeling for the prevention of skin cancer. To date, no evidence on systemic toxicity following dermal exposure of humans to chemical peels has been identified."

Often misdiagnosed as chronic UV-damage or actinic keratoses, patients are treated for years with different therapeutic options with little success. Current treatment options include imiquimod, ingenol mebutate, cryosurgery, photodynamic therapy and topical or systemic therapy with retinoids. Since those approaches show only little success or come along with major side effects, therapeutic alternatives are strongly requested. Methods: We report a series of five female patients with history of DSAP that were successfully treated with chemical peels. Results: All patients suffered from the disease for 14.4 years on average and all were refractory to at least two therapeutic options, mostly imiquimod and topical tretinoin. Patients were treated with glycolic acid 50% and salicylic acid 25% in a two-layer-technique. After a mean of three cycles every 6 weeks a clear reduction in lesion was assessed by physicians. Patients were highly satisfied with outcome and rare occurrence of side effects as assessed by TSQM questionnaire. Conclusion: Chemical peels are safe and well tolerated treatment options for patients with refractory porokeratosis. As characteristic for chronic diseases, frequent repetition of treatment is needed in order to control disease activity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There have been few studies on economic evaluation of acne treatments. Chemical peel (CP), a treatment approach primarily aimed at removing acne hyperpigmentation and scarring, is gradually accepted in the Chinese market. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to detect willingness-to-pay (WTP) and to conduct a benefit-cost analysis for CP treatment among Chinese acne patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The costs were obtained from the patient's perspective and compared with benefits. The net benefits were approximated by WTP, using the contingent valuation method. A glycolic acid peel served as the demonstrated example. WTP and related information were inquired via an online questionnaire among the Chinese population. Factors for WTP were identified using generalized linear models. The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) was calculated. Discounting was not considered for both WTP and costs. RESULTS: The response rate of the survey was 95.4% among the 476 anonymous participants. The average cost for three-time CP treatment was USD 383.4. Statistically significant differences in WTP among the cases were identified. The mean WTP for Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3 was USD 234.6, 222.0, and 401.7, respectively. A statistically significant association between WTP and self-reported acne severity was observed for all cases after adjustments for demographic characteristics (P<0.01). The Cardiff Acne Disability Index was positively associated with WTP. The BCRs were 0.61, 0.58, and 1.4 for Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3, respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with acne in China are willing to pay for acne treatment. Although the benefits of CP treatment have not generally outweighed their aggregated costs, WTP for CP treatment was positively associated with self-reported acne severity and desirable efficacy of treatment. Individualized acne treatments are recommended to target a specific population in the Chinese market."

      "abstract": "Background: Chemoexfoliation, also known as chemical peeling, is a method of targeted cutaneous ablation using specific caustic agents that allow for rapid, predictable, and uniform thickness of chemoablation to a desired cutaneous depth, ultimately resulting in an improved appearance of skin. Objective: In this review, we provide an up-to-date analysis of all currently available chemical peels for dermatologic use, as well as a step-by-step instructional protocol for an algorithmic approach to treatment. Methods: A comprehensive search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and PUBMED databases was performed to identify relevant literature investigating chemical peeling agents. In addition, a search of all commercially available, prescription-based peeling agents was performed to identify all products currently available in the United States market. Results and Conclusion: Chemical peels are the third most commonly performed noninvasive cosmetic procedure in the United States, with over 1,300,000 procedures performed in 2016 alone. There has been a paradigm shift in recent years, with lasers largely supplanting deep peels. Despite this shift, superficial peels have proliferated in both popularity and product diversity. When used for the appropriate indication and with proper technique, nearly all peeling agents have demonstrated excellent clinical efficacy and remain an indispensable cost-effective tool in the dermatologist's aesthetic toolbox."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the clinical efficacy and safety of combination chemical peels vs single peel in treatment of mild-to-moderate acne. METHODS: The study included 45 patients with mild-to-moderate acne divided into three equal groups. Group A underwent combination sequential peels with modified Jessner's solution (MJ) followed by trichloro acetic acid (TCA20%) on the right (Rt) side of the face vs TCA 30% on the left (Lt) side. Group B was treated by combination peels of salicylic (20%) mandelic (10%) (SM) mixture on the Rt half vs salicylic acid 30% on the Lt half. Group C underwent combination sequential peeling of MJ and TCA on the Rt side vs SM combination peels on the Lt side. All patients received six sessions with 2-week intervals and followed up for 3 months after the last session. Side effects were reported. RESULTS: Both sides of the face showed significant improvement of acne lesions but improvement was significantly higher and earlier in sides treated by combination peels. Side effects were minimal. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, combination peels achieved a higher and earlier therapeutic response with a reasonable cost that is maintained for a relatively long periods than single peel. Combination sequential peels gave the best results.",

      "abstract": "Acne vulgaris is the most common skin disorder in adolescents and young adults. It carries a significant psychological and economic burden to patients and society. A wide range of therapeutic options are available, including topicals and systemic therapies. Chemical peeling is a skin resurfacing procedure intended to regenerate normal skin from the application of exfoliative agents. It has been used for the treatment of acne vulgaris and other skin disorders for decades. There are several chemical agents with variable mechanisms of action, usually classified as superficial, medium, and deep peels. When selecting the patient and the appropriate peel, the dermatologist individualizes therapy, and performs an extensive interview, including past medical history and physical exam. Several host factors can affect the outcome of this procedure, including current psychological state, medications, history of surgery, and immune system, among others. The physician must also be confident that the peel is safe and effective for the target patient. The Fitzpatrick skin type scale is a useful tool to classify patients based on skin color and ability to tan, but also can be used to evaluate preoperative risk of postpeel response and complications. Dark-skinned patients (Fitzpatrick skin type IV-VI), including blacks, Asian, and Hispanic/Latino, are at higher risk of postinflammatory/postpeel hyperpigmentation. When treating these populations, deep chemical peels should be avoided, and preoperative preparation emphasized. There are many studies available in the literature supporting the use of superficial to medium depth peels as adjuvant therapy for acne vulgaris. This review article aims to present the most important factors when selecting a patient for a chemical peel, the evidence behind its safety and efficacy, and special considerations when choosing a specific agent."

METHODS: Standard Cochrane methodological procedures were used. We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and EMBASE via OvidSP through April 2017. Reviewers independently assessed eligibility, risk of bias and extracted data. RESULTS: Twelve RCTs (387 participants) were included. Effectiveness was not significantly different: trichloroacetic acid versus salicylic acid (SA) (percentage of total improvement: risk ratio (RR) 0.89; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.10), glycolic acid (GA) versus amino fruit acid (the reduction of inflammatory lesions: mean difference (MD), 0.20; 95% CI -3.03 to 3.43), SA versus pyruvic acid (excellent or good improvement: RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.69), GA versus SA (good or fair improvement: RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.18), GA versus Jessner's solution (JS) (self-reported improvements: RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.44 to 2.26), and lipohydroxy acid versus SA (reduction of non-inflammatory lesions: 55.6%vs48.5%, p=0.878). Combined SA and mandelic acid peeling was superior to GA peeling (percentage of improvement in total acne score: 85.3%vs68.5%, p<0.001). GA peeling was superior to placebo (excellent or good improvement: RR 2.30; 95% CI 1.40 to 3.77). SA peeling may be superior to JS peeling for comedones (reduction of comedones: 53.4%vs26.3%, p=0.001) but less effective than phototherapy for pustules (number of pustules: MD -7.00; 95% CI -10.84 to -3.16). LIMITATIONS: The methodological quality of the included RCTs was very low to moderate. Meta-analysis was not possible due to the significant clinical heterogeneity across studies. CONCLUSION: Commonly used chemical peels appear to be similarly effective for mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris and well tolerated. However, based on current limited evidence, a robust conclusion cannot be drawn regarding any definitive superiority or equality among the currently used chemical peels. Well-designed RCTs are needed to identify optimal regimens.",

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the frequency of side effects and complications associated with superficial chemical peels in patients with skin types III-VI. METHODS: A 5-year single center retrospective analysis was performed. RESULTS: Of 473 chemical peel treatments included in this study, 18 (3.8%) were associated with short-term (≤2 weeks) or long-term (>2 weeks) complications. The most frequent complications were crusting (2.3%), postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (1.9%), and erythema (1.9%). All side effects resolved within 8 months of treatment and were located on the face. When stratified by season, side effects were noted to be less common during the winter. In the adjusted model, Fitzpatrick skin type VI was associated with a higher odds of side effects (odds ratio 5.14, 95% confidence interval 1.21-21.8; P = .0118). LIMITATIONS: Single center retrospective design. CONCLUSION: In this study, superficial chemical peels performed on patients with skin types III-VI had a relatively low complication rate, and skin type VI had higher odds of experiencing an adverse event. Side effects were noted to be less frequent during the winter months.",

RESULTS: Conditions treated successfully with chemical peels in men include acne vulgaris, acne scarring, rosacea, keratosis pilaris, melasma, actinic keratosis, photodamage, resurfacing of surgical reconstruction scars, and periorbital rejuvenation. Chemical peels are commonly combined with other nonsurgical cosmetic procedures to optimize results. Male patients may require a greater number of treatments or higher concentration of peeling agent due to increased sebaceous quality of skin and hair follicle density. CONCLUSION: Chemical peels are a cost-effective and reliable treatment for a variety of aesthetic and medical skin conditions. Given the increasing demand for noninvasive cosmetic procedures among men, dermatologists should have an understanding of chemical peel applications and techniques to address the concerns of male patients.",

It is common practice to follow this standard because of concerns regarding reports of sporadic adverse events and increased risk of scarring. OBJECTIVE: To develop expert consensus regarding the safety of skin procedures, including resurfacing, energy device treatments, and incisional and excisional procedures, in the setting of concurrent or recent isotretinoin use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The American Society for Dermatologic Surgery authorized a task force of content experts to review the evidence and provide guidance. First, data were extracted from the literature. This was followed by a clinical question review, a consensus Delphi process, and validation of the results by peer review. RESULTS: The task force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to justify delaying treatment with superficial chemical peels and nonablative lasers, including hair removal lasers and lights, vascular lasers, and nonablative fractional devices for patients currently or recently exposed to isotretinoin. Superficial and focal dermabrasion may also be safe when performed by a well-trained clinician.",

Treatments need to achieve a balance between tolerability and efficacy to address existing hyperpigmentation without causing additional damage that could trigger post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). An open-label, single-center study was conducted to assess the efficacy of a novel comprehensive pigmentation control serum (LYT2) combined with a series of three very superficial chemical peels (VP) in skin of color subjects. Seventeen female and male subjects aged 36 to 69 years with Fitzpatrick Skin Types III-VI and moderate to severe facial hyperpigmentation were enrolled in the 12-week clinical study. Subjects identified as Asian, Hispanic, African American, or Caucasian ethnicities. Subjects received a series of 3 VP treatments every 4 weeks. LYT2 was applied twice-daily in between VP treatments. Investigator assessments for overall hyperpigmentation, overall photodamage, and skin tone unevenness, as well as standardized digital photography and subject self-assessment questionnaires were conducted at all visits (baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12). In vivo reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) of a target lesion was conducted (in a subset of subjects) at baseline and week 12. Fourteen subjects completed the study. The treatment regimen provided statistically significant improvements in all efficacy parameters at weeks 8 and 12 (all P less than equal to 0.03, student's t-test). Standardized digital photography and RCM images support the improvements in overall hyperpigmentation observed by the investigator. At the end of treatment, the regimen was highly rated by subjects with 100% of subjects (strongly agree/agree) that the combination \"decreased the appearance of uneven skin tone and discolorations\" and \"reduced the appearance of sun damage.\" In addition to this clinical study, independent case studies with this combination treatment regimen at a separate study site were also conducted with results that corroborate the formal clinical study findings. The comprehensive results from these studies suggest that the combination of a comprehensive pigmentation control serum with a series of 3 very superficial chemical peels may provide an effective treatment approach for hyperpigmentation in skin of color patients.</p> <p><em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(4):301-306.</em></p>.",

      "abstract": "Lichen planus pigmentosus is a photodistributed dyschromia of unknown etiology described clinically as hyperpigmented gray-blue or brown-black macules or patches in a photodistributed pattern. Although there has been some debate, lichen planus pigmentosus is considered by many to be a separate diagnostic entity from ashy dermatosis or erythema dyschromicum perstans, which shares similar characteristics. Various treatment strategies have been applied to help resolve or improve the appearance of lichen planus pigmentosus lesions; however, an optimal treatment method is yet to be elucidated. The authors present a case of an 18-year-old Hispanic man with lichen planus pigmentosus whose skin findings responded dramatically to a combined regimen of daily topical azelaic acid foam and tretinoin cream with twice-monthly chemical peels using glycolic acid and Jessner's solution. The authors have noted a sparcity of therapeutic literature for lichen planus pigmentosus, and hope to aid clinicians in therapeutic management strategy for this patient subset."

By using different chemicals in various combinations, strengths, and application techniques, plastic surgeons can tailor a patient's treatment for optimal, safe, and consistent results. Mesotherapy and microneedling have emerged in the plastic surgery literature with increasingly complex indications. Both techniques have increased in popularity although research into efficacy and long-term results is lagging. With a thorough understanding of patients and the modalities available, plastic surgeons can use the appropriate minimally invasive technique to provide patients with desired skin changes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Facial dermabrasion and chemical peel are common cosmetic procedures that are generally safe yet do possess inherent risks. The patient's expectations, formed well in advance of treatment, strongly correlate with overall satisfaction. OBJECTIVES: The authors reviewed and analyzed litigation related to the performance of facial dermabrasion and chemical peel. METHODS: The authors searched the WestlawNext legal database for relevant litigation and examined factors such as allegations raised, patient demographics, defendant specialties, final outcomes, and payments. RESULTS: Proceedings from 25 cases were analyzed, involving 22 female and 2 male plaintiffs; in 1 case, sex was not specified. Sixteen cases (64%) resulted in a decision for the defendant and 9 (36%) were resolved with payments. The median difference between out-of-court settlements (median, $940 000) and jury-awarded damages (median, $535 000) was not statistically significant. Factors raised in litigation included poor cosmetic outcome (80%), alleged intratreatment negligence (68%), permanent injury (64%), informed-consent deficits (60%), emotional/psychological injury (44%), posttreatment negligence (32%), and the need for additional treatment/surgery (32%). CONCLUSIONS: Out-of-court settlements and jury-awarded damages were considerable in cases where physicians practicing various (or multiple) specialties were named as defendants. These findings emphasize the need for physicians to thoroughly document potential complications prior to treatment, during the informed-consent process. Additionally, general considerations should be taken into account, such as patient expectations and the potential need for other procedures, which may enhance pretreatment communication and ultimately minimize liability. Finally, it is important to stress that physicians may be held liable for procedures performed by nonphysician ancillary staff.",

      "abstract": "Melasma is a common disorder of hyperpigmentation, which has a severe impact on the quality of life. Inspite of tremendous research, the treatment remains frustrating both to the patient and the treating physician. Dark skin types (Fitzpatrick types IV to VI) are especially difficult to treat owing to the increased risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). The treatment ranges from a variety of easily applied topical therapies to agents like lasers and chemical peels. Peels are a well-known modality of treatment for melasma, having shown promising results in many clinical trials. However, in darker races, the choice of the peeling agent becomes relatively limited; so, there is the need for priming agents and additional maintenance peels. Although a number of new agents have come up, there is little published evidence supporting their use in day-to -day practice. The traditional glycolic peels prove to be the best both in terms of safety as well as efficacy. Lactic acid peels being relatively inexpensive and having shown equally good results in a few studies, definitely need further experimentation. We also recommend the use of a new peeling agent, the easy phytic solution, which does not require neutralisation unlike the traditional alpha-hydroxy peels. The choice of peeling agent, the peel concentration as well as the frequency and duration of peels are all important to achieve optimum results."

This article aims to summarize and evaluate the existing studies on the role of chemical peels in the treatment of acne and acne scars among Asians. An online search was conducted to identify prospective studies published in English that evaluated the use of chemical peels in active acne and acne scars in Asian populations. There were six studies for acne and eight studies for acne scars that were identified using our search parameters. Most were single-centre, open label and with small sample sizes. Acne severity was not uniformly reported and the objective outcome measures of some studies were not explicitly reported as well. The general trend of the results of the studies support the safety and efficacy of chemical peels for acne and acne scars including those of darker skin types. The existing studies support the use of chemical peels in the treatment of acne and acne scars in Asians. Further clinical trials with better study design and more subjects are needed to further establish the role of chemical peels in Asian acne patients."

The available treatments reflect the complex and multifactorial contributors to acne pathogenesis, with topical retinoids as first-line therapy for mild acne, topical retinoids in combination with anti-microbials for moderate acne, and isotretinoin for severe nodular acne. Unfortunately, these conventional therapies may not be effective against refractory acne, can lead to antibiotic resistance, and is associated with adverse effects. With the rise of new technologies and in-office procedures, light and laser therapy, photodynamic therapy, chemical peels, and comedo extraction are growing in popularity as adjunctive treatments and may offer alternatives to those who desire better efficacy, quicker onset of action, improved safety profile, reduced risk of antibiotic resistance, and non-systemic administration. Whereas adjunctive therapies are generally well-tolerated, the number of randomized controlled trials are few and limited by small sample sizes. Furthermore, results demonstrating efficacy of certain light therapies are mixed and studies involving photodynamic therapy and chemical peels have yet to standardize and optimize application, formulation, and exposure times. Nevertheless, adjunctive therapies, particularly blue light and photodynamic therapy, show promise as these treatments also target factors of acne pathogenesis and may potentially complement current conventional therapy.",

Many clinicians use these peels in the treatment of acne and acne-prone oily skin. OBJECTIVES: This article examines the evidence base that supports the widespread use of superficial peels in this setting. METHODS: A search of the English language medical literature was performed to identify clinical trials that formally evaluated the use of chemical peeling in active acne. RESULTS: Search of the literature revealed very few clinical trials of peels in acne (N=13); a majority of these trials included small numbers of patients, were not controlled and were open label. The evidence that is available does support the use of chemical peels in acne as all trials had generally favourable results despite differences in assessments, treatment regimens and patient populations. Notably, no studies of chemical peels have used an acne medication as a comparator. As not every publication specified whether or not concomitant acne medications were allowed, it is hard to evaluate clearly how many of the studies evaluated the effect of peeling alone. This may be appropriate, however, given that few clinicians would use superficial chemical peels as the sole treatment for acne except in rare instances where a patient could not tolerate other treatment modalities. CONCLUSIONS: In the future, further study is needed to determine the best use of chemical peels in this indication.",

      "abstract": "Chemical peeling is a popular, relatively inexpensive, and generally safe method for treatment of some skin disorders and to refresh and rejuvenate skin. This article focuses on chemical peels and their use in routine clinical practice. Chemical peels are classified by the depth of action into superficial, medium, and deep peels. The depth of the peel is correlated with clinical changes, with the greatest change achieved by deep peels. However, the depth is also associated with longer healing times and the potential for complications. A wide variety of peels are available, utilizing various topical agents and concentrations, including a recent salicylic acid derivative, beta-lipohydroxy acid, which has properties that may expand the clinical use of peels. Superficial peels, penetrating only the epidermis, can be used to enhance treatment for a variety of conditions, including acne, melasma, dyschromias, photodamage, and actinic keratoses. Medium-depth peels, penetrating to the papillary dermis, may be used for dyschromia, multiple solar keratoses, superficial scars, and pigmentary disorders. Deep peels, affecting reticular dermis, may be used for severe photoaging, deep wrinkles, or scars. Peels can be combined with other in-office facial resurfacing techniques to optimize outcomes and enhance patient satisfaction and allow clinicians to tailor the treatment to individual patient needs. Successful outcomes are based on a careful patient selection as well as appropriate use of specific peeling agents. Used properly, the chemical peel has the potential to fill an important therapeutic need in the dermatologist's and plastic surgeon's armamentarium."

AIM: This study was designed to compare the therapeutic response of melasma in Indian women to glycolic acid (GA 20-35%) versus trichloroacetic acid (TCA 10-20%) for chemical peeling. METHODS: Forty nonpregnant female patients with a minimum melasma area and severity index (MASI) of 10 were recruited in the study. After a detailed history and clinical examination under natural light, MASI was calculated and color photographs were taken of all the patients. The patients were advised to carry out a prepeel program of daily application of 12% GA cream or 0.1% tretinoin at night for 2 weeks. They were then treated with graded concentrations of 20-35% GA facial peel every 15 days in GA group and 10-20% TCA in the second group. RESULTS: Objective response to treatment evaluated by reduction in MASI scoring after 12 weeks was by 79% reduction (from 26.6 to 5.6) in GA group and by 73% reduction in TCA group (from 29.1 to 8.2) but this difference was not significant. Patients with epidermal-type melasma showed a better response to treatment than those with mixed-type melasma (P<0.05). Subjective response, as graded by the patient, showed good or very good response in 75% in GA group and 65% in TCA group. No relation of treatment response to age and duration of melasma could be established in this study. CONCLUSIONS: A prepeel program of daily application of 12% GA cream at night for 2 weeks, followed by graded increase in GA and TCA concentrations proved to be an equally effective treatment modality for epidermal and mixed melasma. There are hardly any major side effects, and regular use of sunscreens prevents chances of postpeel hyperpigmentation. GA peel is associated with fewer side effects than TCA and has the added advantage of facial rejuvenation.",

The basic procedure aims at obtaining a controlled chemical burn of the epidermis and/or dermis. This results in epidermal regeneration and postinflammatory collagen neoformation with remodeling of collagen and elastic fibers and deposition of glycosaminoglycans in the dermis. Various chemicals have been used as peeling agents, of which the most used are the alpha-hydroxy acids, such as glycolic acid, or beta-hydroxy acids, such as salicylic acid. The choice of the compound is linked to the different indications and to the depth of the desired peeling. Phenol is still the best agent for deep peeling but requires specific indications, prescription, and post-peeling care. Combination of different compounds is one innovation in the field of chemical peelings. Further controlled studies are necessary to set up specific guidelines.",

      "abstract": "Chemical peeling is a popular, relatively inexpensive, and generally safe method to refresh and rejuvenate skin. This review focuses on superficial chemical peels and their use in routine clinical practice. A wide variety of peels are available, utilizing various actives and concentrations, including a recently introduced salicylic acid derivative, beta-lipohydroxy acid, which has properties that may expand the clinical use of peels. Superficial peels can be used to enhance treatment within a variety of conditions, including acne, melasma, dyschromias, photodamage and actinic keratoses. In addition, peels can be combined with other in-office procedures to optimize outcomes and enhance patient satisfaction, and allow clinicians to tailor the treatment to individual patient's needs. Successful outcomes are based on a thorough understanding and application of correct chemical peel procedures, including history-taking, pretreatment, preparation, peel selection, patient communication and maintenance regimens.Used properly, the superficial chemical peel has the potential to fill an important therapeutic need in the treatment armamentarium of dermatologists and plastic surgeons.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Chemical peeling is the application of a chemical agent to the skin, which causes controlled destruction of a part of or the entire epidermis, with or without the dermis, leading to exfoliation and removal of superficial lesions, followed by regeneration of new epidermal and dermal tissues. Indications for chemical peeling include pigmentary disorders, superficial acne scars, ageing skin changes, and benign epidermal growths. Contraindications include patients with active bacterial, viral or fungal infection, tendency to keloid formation, facial dermatitis, taking photosensitizing medications and unrealistic expectations. PHYSICIANS' QUALIFICATIONS: The physician performing chemical peeling should have completed postgraduate training in dermatology. The training for chemical peeling may be acquired during post graduation or later at a center that provides education and training in cutaneous surgery or in focused workshops providing such training. The physician should have adequate knowledge of the different peeling agents used, the process of wound healing, the technique as well as the identification and management of complications. FACILITY: Chemical peeling can be performed safely in any clinic/outpatient day care dermatosurgical facility. PREOPERATIVE COUNSELING AND INFORMED CONSENT: A detailed consent form listing details about the procedure and possible complications should be signed by the patient. The consent form should specifically state the limitations of the procedure and should clearly mention if more procedures are needed for proper results. The patient should be provided with adequate opportunity to seek information through brochures, presentations, and personal discussions. The need for postoperative medical therapy should be emphasized. Superficial peels are considered safe in Indian patients. Medium depth peels should be performed with great caution, especially in dark skinned patients. Deep peels are not recommended for Indian skin. It is essential to do prepeel priming of the patient's skin with sunscreens, hydroquinone and tretinoin for 2-4 weeks. ENDPOINTS IN PEELS: For glycolic acid peels: The peel is neutralized after a predetermined duration of time (usually three minutes). However, if erythema or epidermolysis occurs, seen as grayish white appearance of the epidermis or as small blisters, the peel must be immediately neutralized with 10-15% sodium bicarbonate solution, regardless of the duration of application of the peel. The end-point is frosting for TCA peels, which are neutralized either with a neutralizing agent or cold water, starting from the eyelids and then the entire face. For salicylic acid peels, the end point is the pseudofrost formed when the salicylic acid crystallizes. Generally, 1-3 coats are applied to get an even frost; it is then washed with water after 3-5 minutes, after the burning has subsided. Jessner's solution is applied in 1-3 coats until even frosting is achieved or erythema is seen. Postoperative care includes sunscreens and moisturizers Peels may be repeated weekly, fortnightly or monthly, depending on the type and depth of the peel.",

No well-controlled studies have compared alpha- and beta-hydroxy acid peels in the treatment of mild to moderately severe facial acne. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of alpha- and beta-hydroxy acid chemical peels in the treatment of mild to moderately severe facial acne vulgaris. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients were recruited in this split-face, double-blind, randomized, controlled study. An alpha-hydroxy acid (30% glycolic acid) was applied to one-half of the face and a beta-hydroxy acid peel (30% salicylic acid) was applied contralaterally every 2 weeks for a total of six treatments. A blinded evaluator performed quantitative assessment of papules and pustules. RESULTS: Both chemical peels were significantly effective by the second treatment (p<.05) and there were no significant differences in effectiveness between the two peels. At 2 months posttreatment, the salicylic acid peel had sustained effectiveness. More adverse events were reported with the glycolic acid peel after the initial treatment. CONCLUSION: The glycolic acid and salicylic acid peels were similarly effective. The salicylic acid peel had sustained effectiveness and fewer side effects. Alpha- and beta-hydroxy acid peels both offer successful adjunctive treatment of facial acne vulgaris.",

The main indications for this procedure include photoaging, perioral wrinkling, acne scars, and precancerous skin lesions. The most important potential complication of deep peels is cardiotoxicity. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to estimate incidence of cardiac complications during full-face deep chemical peel and to suggest the methods to reduce the rate of this potential complication. METHODS: Clinical data on the patients being treated by full-face deep chemical peel between December 1, 2004, and November 30, 2005, were recorded. Full cardiomonitoring was performed during the peeling procedure. Any arrhythmia or medical intervention was recorded. RESULTS: A total of 181 patients have been treated during the study period. All the patients were female; the mean age was 56 years (range, 30-77 years). In 12 patients (6.6%), cardiac arrhythmia has been recorded during the procedure. Cardiac arrhythmia was more common in patients with diabetes, hypertension, and depression. In 4 patients the arrhythmia was self-limited and did not require any intervention. In the other 8 patients, 100 mg of lidocaine was given intravenously to control the arrhythmia. CONCLUSION: The incidence of cardiac complications in appropriately performed deep chemical peeling is lower than previously appreciated.",

Lactic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid that has not been used before in chemical peeling of melasma. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present work was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lactic acid in chemical peeling of melasma in comparison to Jessner's solution chemical peels. METHODS: This study was conducted at the Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Baghdad Hospital, in the period between April 2001 and August 2002. Thirty patients with melasma were included in this study. They were mostly of skin type IV according to Fitzpatrick's classification, 26 (86.67%) were women, and 4 (13.33%) were men, with an age range from 18 and 50 years (mean+/-SD, 33.53+/-6.96 years). Full clinical examination was done to all patients including Wood's light. The severity of melasma was assessed by MASI (Melasma Area Severity Index). Pure lactic acid full strength (92%, pH 3.5) was used as a new peeling agent on the left side of the face while Jessner's solution was applied to the right side of the face. The chemical peeling sessions were done every 3 weeks until the desired response was achieved. Follow-up was carried out for 6 months after the last session. RESULTS: Six patients were defaulted from the study after the first session for unknown reasons. Twenty-four patients completed the study. Twenty (83.33%) were women and four were men (16.67%). Wood's light examination showed increased contrast in all patients of mostly epidermal melasma. The number of sessions ranged from 2 to 5. All patients showed marked improvement as calculated by MASI score before and after treatment, and the response was highly statistically significant. No side effect was recorded in all treated patients. CONCLUSION: Lactic acid was found to be an effective and safe peeling agent in the treatment of melasma, and it was as effective as Jessner's solution.",

OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of repeated, medium-depth chemical peels in the treatment of periorbital wrinkles in dark-skinned individuals. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 12 subjects (10 women and 2 men) with fine and/or medium-sized wrinkles were included in the study, the ages ranged from 30 to 55 years with a mean of 41.25. Focal, medium-depth peels of periorbital area including crow's foot wrinkles were performed using a combination of Jessner's solution followed by the application of 35% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The study involved a four-session regimen. To be included in this study, the subject completed at least two peeling sessions, 1 month apart, and returned for follow-up according to the research schedule. RESULTS: Improvement occurred in 11 of 12 subjects. Marked improvement occurred in four subjects (33%), moderate improvement in three (25%), mild improvement in another three (25%), minimal improvement in one subject (8%), and no response in one subject (8%). There were seven patients with fine and five with medium periorbital wrinkles. For statistical analysis, the no and minimum response groups were categorized as nonresponders. The improvement that ranged between marked to mild occurred in 100% of subjects with fine wrinkles and 60% of subjects with medium wrinkles. Mild side effects appeared in four subjects (33%). CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that fine and/or medium periorbital wrinkling responds favorably to repeated, medium-depth chemical peels even in dark-skinned individuals with few mild side effects."

METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with mild to moderate facial acne were included. Twenty-seven patients were treated with 30% glycolic acid peels and 11 patients with Jessner's solution peels. Each peel was performed twice with an interval of 2 weeks. Before and 2 weeks after each peel, sebum levels of forehead, nose, chin and cheeks were measured by using a Sebumeter (SM810 Courage & Khazaka, Cologne, Germany). RESULTS: The sebum levels were not significantly changed by two peels treatments of 30% glycolic acid peels or Jessner's solution peels on the facial skins of patients with facial acne. CONCLUSIONS: The two types of peels, 30% glycolic acid peels and Jessner's solution peels, did not affect sebum secretion of the facial skins of patients with facial acne after the two peels treatments. The accumulative effects of more than two peels treatments using these modalities need further evaluation.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and morbidity of a series of superficial glycolic acid (GA) peels with those of a midlevel trichloroacetic acid (TCA) peel. METHODS: We conducted a split-face study of 7 female patients, comparing the benefits of a single 35% TCA peel with those of a series of 5 30% GA peels performed at monthly intervals. Throughout the study, we performed noninvasive biophysical measurements, optical imaging, and expert and naïve image evaluations and conducted subject-group discussions so that we might objectively quantify and compare the treatments over time. An additional objective of the research was to use quantitative objective measurements of skin condition and actinic damage to establish these techniques as biologically based standards for treatment evaluation. RESULTS: Skin elasticity and hydration increased during the course of the study but were not significantly different between the 2 treatment modes. Overall improvement with both treatments was relatively small as judged by expert evaluations of digital images taken at baseline and 3 months after treatment. No important differences were perceived when naïve judges were asked to evaluate the images. Digital-image analysis of wrinkles in the cheek region revealed significantly greater improvement in wrinkles with the TCA peel. In patient-group discussions, TCA peels were associated with greater improvement but also with more discomfort; GA peels were associated with a high degree of satisfaction, although their effect on quantitative technical measures of actinic damage was not dramatic. CONCLUSIONS: Although a single TCA peel produced more improvement than a series of superficial peels, the differences were small, and the TCA peel was associated with significantly greater discomfort."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of medium-depth peels in the treatment of acne scars. METHODS: A total of 15 patients (14 women and 1 man) were seen between November 1998 and March 2000. A medium-depth chemical peel was performed. The peel was performed using a combination of Jessner's solution followed by the application of 35% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The mean age of patients who entered the study was 28 years. A total of 42 peeling sessions were performed: 13 patients had the full three-session regiment, 1 patient had two sessions, and 1 had only one session. RESULTS: Patients in our study had two forms of acne scars, the atrophic saucer or crater-like form and the pitted (ice-pick) form. Improvement occurred in all except one of our patients. Significant improvement (greater than 75% clearance of lesions) occurred in 1 patient (6.6%), moderate improvement (51-75% clearance) in 8 patients (53.3%), mild improvement (26-50% clearance) in 4 patients (26.6%), minimal improvement (1-25% clearance) in 1 patient (6.6%), and no response in 1 patient (6.6%). All patients had different combinations of the above two forms. Four patients (26.6%) had mainly pitted scars and deep atrophic scars. The clinical response in those patients was moderate, mild, minimal, and no response, respectively. The remainder of our patients had mainly atrophic scars of moderate depth. Nine patients (73.4%) suffered from transient postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. In two of them it was preceded by erythema that lasted for more than 1 month. All patients were free of noticeable pigmentation 3 months after the final peel. Patients in whom hyperpigmentation did not develop were of light brown complexion. CONCLUSION: We conclude that medium-depth chemical peel is a safe and effective method of treating acne scars even in patients with dark complexion.",

      "abstract": "Facial skin rejuvenation continues to be a popular nonsurgical outpatient procedure performed by many facial plastic surgeons. Chemical peeling techniques continue to provide consistent and reliable results. By using variations of the Baker-Gordon solution and by varying the concentrations of TCA, several skin conditions may be treated. Because no one skin resurfacing procedure can be used for all patients, the most successful outcome is achieved when the treatment is individualized. Overall, skin resurfacing procedures remain one of the most rewarding procedures for the patient and surgeon.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a dearth of published data regarding chemical peels in darker racial-ethnic groups. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of a new superficial salicylic acid peel in individuals of skin types V and VI. METHODS: Twenty-five patients were included in this pilot investigation. Nine had acne vulgaris, 5 had post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, 6 had melasma, and 5 had rough, oily skin with enlarged pores. The patients were pre-treated for 2 weeks with hydroquinone 4% prior to undergoing a series of five salicylic acid chemical peels. The concentrations of salicylic acid were 20% and 30%. The peels were performed at 2 week intervals. RESULTS. Moderate to significant improvement was observed in 88% of the patients. Minimal to mild side effects occurred in 16%. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that superficial salicylic acid peels are both safe and efficacious for treatment of acne vulgaris, oily skin, textural changes, melasma, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation in patients with skin types V and VI.",

      "abstract": "The new pulsed CO2 lasers are an exciting modality. They have the ability to do what no other procedure can do with the same safety profile. The drawbacks of cost, pain and prolonged healing, however, serve to limit the lasers use to a niche, rather than replacing all other means of skin resurfacing. Skin problems of the epidermis and superficial papillary dermis are more easily and less expensively treated with chemical peeling. This includes most types of hyperpigmentation as well as actinic keratoses and poorly textured skin. This is especially true of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, in which any procedure that creates prolonged erythema dramatically increases the risk of increased pigmentation. In these patients, the use of CO2 laser resurfacing is risky, if not even contraindicated. Skin problems of the deeper papillary dermis and reticular dermis, such as rhytides and scars, however, respond as well to laser resurfacing as they do to deep chemical peels, but with a better safety profile and a more natural clinical appearance of the healed skin. In many cases, the patient would be better served with a medium depth chemical peel of the entire face and laser resurfacing of the rhytides in the perioral or periorbital areas. This would give the patient the best clinical result with the fastest recovery. The major drawback to this type of therapy has been that the postoperative care of the two treatment regions is different. This may cause some logistical difficulties for the patient, as well as some confusion. Certainly, another option is to treat the patient on two separate occasions; that is, first peel the entire face and then later go back and laser resurface the areas of the remaining rhytides. Although this approach creates more healing time for the patient, it minimizes the areas of prolonged erythema, thereby allowing the patient a faster return to normal. As laser technology continues to advance, we can expect faster healing times and less expensive machinery. Presumably, with our current understanding of the wound healing process, we should expect better post laser treatment regimens, with associated faster healing. Therefore, it is distinctly possible that the current niche for pulsed CO2 lasers will be expanded greatly in the next year or two.",

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to develop a marker to indicate when all areas of skin have been treated and avoid reliance on a map or operator recall. METHODS: With a Wood's lamp (maximum output 365 nm) and addition of salicylic acid and fluorescein sodium, solutions that are readily available, the progress of the superficial chemical peel can be visualized. RESULTS: Wood's lamp accentuates epidermal pigment and therefore highlights dyschromia that will respond to a superficial chemical peel. Similarly, salicylic acid and fluorescein sodium fluoresce when viewed under Wood's lamp examination. CONCLUSION: When fluorescent compounds are incorporated into a superficial chemical peel, then fluorescence can accurately locate skip areas, minimize inadvertent overlayering, and thereby avoid deeper penetration.",

The use of peeling for the therapy of pigmentary dyschromias, actinic keratoses and rhytides, depressed scarring, and in selected cases, irradiation dermatitis, is amplified by the discovery of new wounding agents and new variations in technique. Appropriate growth in the objective evaluation of these agents and techniques is dependent on the demonstrative histology and the sharing of knowledge of both excellent results and significant complications in the dermatologic surgical literature.",
