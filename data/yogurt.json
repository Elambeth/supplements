      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Diabetes kidney disease (DKD) is the most prevalent of chronic renal disease (CKD) and the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide, primarily attributed to the increasing prevalence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We aimed to investigate potential associations between the consumption of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and yogurt and DKD, addressing a critical gap in current research concerning dietary interventions and renal health outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among adults with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2007 to 2016. Weighted univariate logistic regression analysis, subgroup analysis, and interaction analysis were conducted to assess the relationship between probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, yogurt supplements and DKD. Additionally, the restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was applied to assess potential nonlinear relationships between yogurt supplements and DKD. RESULTS: The study included 2665 individuals, of whom 1044 (39.2%) had a diagnosis of DKD. Multivariable logistic regression indicated an independent association between probiotic, prebiotic, synbiotic, or yogurt intake and a reduced risk of DKD after adjusting for covariates (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.52-0.96, P =0.03). Subgroup analysis results indicated inconsistencies in the correlations between DKD and probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, or yogurt. Interaction analysis showed that age, gender, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), body mass index, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or antibiotic therapy had no significantly influence on the positive correlation (all p >0.05). The RCS model indicated no nonlinear relationship between yogurt intake and DKD. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated significant inverse associations between probiotic, prebiotic, synbiotics, or yogurt supplements and DKD prevalence in T2DM patients. Further large-scale studies with extended follow-up periods are warranted to confirm these findings and develop evidence-based dietary guidelines for clinical practice."

      "abstract": "Diarrhea is a leading cause of mortality among children under five, with few effective interventions beyond oral rehydration, antibiotics, and zinc supplementation. This study aimed to identify and evaluate the probiotic and anti-diarrheal potential of Enterococcus faecium WFD-128, isolated from fermented yogurt, through in vitro, in silico, and in vivo approaches. The bacterium showed notable antibacterial activity, with inhibition zones measuring 21 mm and 19 mm against Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei, respectively. Additionally, it exhibited anti-biofilm effectiveness of 82 % and 80 % against these pathogens. It exhibited resistance to Amoxicillin, intermediate sensitivity to Ampicillin and Chloramphenicol, and tolerance to bile salts over 3-48h, and to acidic pH levels ranging from 2 to 8. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) identified 68 volatile compounds, of which [1,1'-Bicyclohexyl]-4-carboxylic acid, 4'-propyl-, 4-fluorophenyl ester (-8.5) and Cholest-4-en-26-oic acid, 3-oxo-, methyl ester (-7.9) showed strong binding affinities to the diarrheal protein T3SS of Shigella sonnei (PDB: 6WRY) in molecular docking studies. These compounds exhibited favorable pharmaceutical properties in ADMET analysis, further supported by molecular dynamics simulations. In vivo experiments with albino mice validated the bacterium's therapeutic potential. Histopathological analysis revealed significant recovery of diarrhea-affected organs, including the kidney, liver, intestine, and spleen, following treatment with E. faecium. This aligns with in vitro and in silico findings, demonstrating the bacterium's therapeutic effectiveness. This study highlights the promise of E. faecium as a probiotic-based treatment against bacteria-induced diarrhea, offering a strong foundation for the development of innovative anti-diarrheal therapeutics."

Over nine weeks, 196 children participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, consuming 125 ml daily of either probiotic yogurt containing Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus yoba 2012 and Streptococcus thermophilus C106 or a non-fermented dairy placebo. The primary outcome, average daily incidence of upper respiratory tract symptoms, showed no significant difference between groups. However, the probiotic yogurt group experienced a significant reduction in respiratory tract infection symptoms over time (p = 0.02). Biomarker analysis revealed significant changes in the probiotic yogurt group, including higher urine hippurate levels (p = 0.02), increased lactic acid bacteria (p = 0.04) and total bacterial load (p = 0.04) in stool, and elevated SLPI (p = 0.005) in saliva from baseline to endline. Despite these within-group effects, the lack of significant differences between the yogurt and placebo groups highlights the need for further research with larger cohorts and longer durations to confirm the potential benefits of this probiotic yogurt for reducing infection symptoms and improving health biomarkers under these study conditions.",

      "abstract": "The consumption of an unbalanced diet, such as a high-fat diet, is strongly associated with hyperlipidemia and significantly contributes to the development of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, which are the leading causes of death worldwide. Globally, about 17.9 million people die of cardiovascular disease each year (WHO 2023). Probiotics have emerged as a promising intervention to alleviate hyperlipidemia. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of Lactobacillus fermentum 166 (LF-166), isolated from yak yogurt in the Sichuan Tibetan area, on lipid metabolism in the liver and gut microbiota of high-fat-diet-induced hyperlipidemic mice. The results revealed that the Lactobacillus fermentum 166 (LF-166) treatment reduced the body weight and decreased the blood and liver lipid levels in these mice. Based on the histopathological findings, LF-166 could alleviate liver steatosis and colon injury. Additionally, 16S rRNA sequencing of the mice's colonic contents showed that LF-166 reduced the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) value and enhanced the richness and diversity of the gut microbiota. LF-166 regulated hepatic lipid metabolism through the up-regulation of the genes Lxr, Ampkα, Fxr, Hsl, and Atgl and the down-regulation of C/ebpα and Pparγ in the liver; it also regulated intestinal lipid metabolism by up-regulating Abcg5 and Abcg8 in the ileum and down-regulating the expression of the genes Npc1l1, Asbt, and Ibabp. Thus, LF-166 may inhibit hyperlipidemia progression by modulating the expression of key genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism, influencing the intestinal microbiota through the liver-gut axis, and regulating systemic lipid metabolism."

This study evaluates changes in salivary pH, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) following the consumption of candies and yogurt. AIM: To compare the impact of candies on the oral environment and assess the effectiveness of rinsing with water versus consuming yogurt in reversing cariogenic changes in saliva. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Baseline saliva samples (5 mL) were collected from 60 children. Participants consumed candies, and saliva was collected 10 min post-consumption. They were divided into two groups: Group 1 rinsed with water, and Group 2 consumed yogurt. Saliva samples were collected at 10, 20 and 30 min post-intervention and analyzed for pH, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and TAC. Data were analyzed using paired t-tests and post hoc Tukey tests. RESULTS: Candy consumption significantly decreased pH, calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase levels (p < 0.001) and increased TAC levels (p < 0.001). Both water rinsing and yogurt consumption reversed these changes. Yogurt showed superior remineralization, with pH, calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase levels returning to baseline more effectively than water rinsing (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). TAC levels were also restored more quickly with yogurt (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Candy consumption induces a cariogenic environment. Both water rinsing and yogurt consumption effectively reversed these effects, with yogurt showing enhanced remineralization potential."

      "abstract": "The popularity of Greek-style yogurt (made from cow, ewe, and goat milk) has grown significantly in recent years thanks to its high protein content, nutritional value, and unique creamy texture, making it vulnerable to illegal practices, such as adulteration. In the present work, a fast and reliable matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)-based methodology was developed for the detection of yogurt adulteration with cow milk powder, exploiting the intact protein profile. An integrated protein-based workflow was established for the detection of as little as 1% cow milk powder addition into cow and goat milk yogurt. Simultaneously, markers for yogurt classification based on their animal origin (cow, ewe, or goat), type (traditional or strained), and thermal treatment of milk were revealed for the first time. Statistical analysis using chemometric tools, such as unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and supervised partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) recognition techniques, were implemented for the discrimination/classification of the yogurt samples."

This study aimed to investigate the effects of 3 pasteurization methods, including low-temperature, long-time treatment at 63°C for 30 min (LTLT-1) and 65°C for 30 min (LTLT-2), and high-temperature, short-time treatment at 75°C for 15 s (HTST), on the physicochemical properties, stability, and biological activity of set yogurt fortified with astaxanthin-rich yolk. The results showed that the LTLT-2 group had a higher astaxanthin retention, with no significant difference from the LTLT-1 group. The in vitro digestion results also confirmed that LTLT-2 had a high free radical scavenging capacity. Temperatures between 63°C and 65°C are within a safe range for preventing significant heat degradation of astaxanthin. Over the 21-d storage period, LTLT-2 significantly outperformed LTLT-1 and HTST regarding texture and particle size. This work demonstrates that the pasteurization conditions of 65°C for 30 min could be used to prepare a functional set yogurt with stable quality and antioxidant activity.",

This in vitro study aimed to quantify and compare the protective efficacy of yogurt and milk against acidic beverages using stereomicroscopy, weight reduction experiments, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Overall, 24 freshly extracted single-rooted human teeth (preserved in neutral buffered formalin) were randomly divided into four treatment subgroups: yogurt, milk, topical fluoridated tooth cream (TFTC), and unprotected teeth. They were immersed periodically in the six commonly consumed acidic beverages. Four control teeth were neither protected nor immersed in any beverage. The protective efficacy of these agents was calculated from the quantification of surface changes using stereomicroscopy and the extent of percentage weight reduction. SEM was also conducted on selected samples to validate the stereomicroscopic observations. One-way analysis of variance and Tukey's honestly significant difference analysis of the quantified stereomicroscopic features showed that TFTC significantly outperformed other agents in terms of preventing erosive surface changes in human teeth (p < 0.05). Similar findings were observed in the weight reduction experiment, which further supported the stereomicroscopic findings. It revealed that TFTC, yogurt, and milk provided significant protection in comparison to the unprotected group of teeth (p < 0.05) against weight reduction caused by acidic beverages. SEM analysis supported the hypothesis that protected teeth showed lesser ultrastructural damage when compared to unprotected teeth."

Given that Jersey milk is derived from Jersey cows, this study was to isolate probiotics from Jersey cow feces and investigate their potential as alternative starter cultures for fermenting Jersey milk. Our goal was to develop new starter cultures specifically suited for Jersey yogurt production, while also contributing to the diversity of fermentation agents available for dairy products. This study aimed to evaluate the probiotic functions of Ligilactobacillus salivarius isolated from the feces of newborn Jersey calves after colostrum consumption and to investigate its impact as a starter culture on the quality of Jersey yogurt. RESULTS: A lactic acid bacterial strain was screened through acid and bile salt tolerance tests and simulated gastrointestinal experiments. The strain survived up to 42.8% after 3 h of cultivation at pH 2, and its viable count after 3 h of cultivation in a medium containing 0.3% bile salt was 3 log(CFU mL-1). Additionally, the survival rates after 3 h of treatment with gastric and intestinal juices were 90.67 ± 0.41% and 84.97 ± 1.40%, respectively, indicating good acid and bile salt tolerance. Identification using 16S rDNA showed that the strain was L. salivarius JCF5. This strain improved the texture properties such as viscosity, elasticity and cohesiveness of yogurt when used in combination with commercial starter cultures. CONCLUSION: Ligilactobacillus salivarius JCF5 is a promising probiotic strain for enhancing the quality of Jersey yogurt. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",

However, yogurt production faces challenges like texture, consistency, and syneresis. Hydrocolloids, such as gums and polysaccharides, can enhance yogurt's consistency and rheological properties. This research evaluates rooster comb extract (RCE) as a natural additive to improve stirred yogurt's properties during 21 days of storage at 4°C. Two treatments with 0.8 and 0.9 g of RCE were added to stirred yogurt. Results showed a decrease in pH (from 3.89 to 4.38) and microbial counts (> 107 log CFU/g), along with an increase in titratable acidity (1.03%-1.48%) in RCE-enriched yogurt (p < 0.05). The 0.8 g RCE treatment showed reduced syneresis, lightness, and setting time compared to the control (p < 0.05). Rheological analysis indicated thixotropic shear-thinning behavior, accurately described by the Herschel-Bulkley model. All samples displayed solid viscoelastic properties, with the storage modulus exceeding the loss modulus in the linear viscoelastic region. While flavor and overall acceptability declined in enriched samples compared to controls (p < 0.05), no significant differences were found in other characteristics, including texture, color, and aroma (p > 0.05). In conclusion, RCE is a promising natural hydrocolloid for producing functional stirred yogurt, offering potential consumer benefits."

      "abstract": "Hepatic steatosis/non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a major public health delinquent caused by the excess deposition of lipid into lipid droplets (LDs) as well as metabolic dysregulation. Hepatic cells buildup with more fat molecules when a person takes high fat diet that is excessive than the body can handle. At present, millions of people in the world are affected by this problem. So, it is very important to know the effects of factors responsible for the disease. Here, the role of lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis and metabolism was analyzed and intended to investigate if defects in biogenesis/metabolic enzymes are responsible for the accumulation of lipids other than LDs in fatty liver disease in high-fat-induced conditions in mice model. To explore it, high-fat diet (HFD), fast food (FF), and soft drinks (SD) were administered to wild-type Swiss albino mice for 14 weeks following yogurt supplementation. After experimental period, glucose tolerance, enzyme function, lipid profile, plasma biochemistry, and other analytical tests were analyzed by auto-analyzer including different oxidative stress markers. Lipids from hepatic tissues were extracted, and purified by Floatation Assay and subsequently analyzed by different biochemical and chromatographic techniques. Histological architecture of hepatocytes was performed using Zeiss microscope. Finally, increased amount of lipids biogenesis/accumulation was found in liver tissues that causes Fatty liver disease. Significantly, HFD, FF, and SD were identified as factors for the increased LD biogenesis and or lipid metabolic disorder. Nevertheless, yogurt supplementation can homeostasis those LD formation and metabolic syndrome as it increases the down regulation of lipid biogenesis as well as lipid metabolic rate. So, yogurt supplementation was considered as a novel agent for decreasing LD biogenesis as well as excessive accumulation of fat in hepatocytes which can be used as therapeutics for the treatment of NAFLD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple observational studies have demonstrated the health benefits of yogurt, which are considered due to yogurt's positive effects on the gut microbiota. It is also known that the intestinal microbiota is associated with cognitive and emotional functions. Although the intake of probiotics has been reported to improve neurodevelopmental symptoms in children, no large-scale studies have examined the association of yogurt consumption in early childhood with later neurodevelopmental status. In this study, we examined the association between frequency of such consumption at 1 year of age and the children's subsequent neurodevelopmental status. METHODS: We studied children's dietary consumption of yogurt at age 1 year and their neurodevelopment at age 3 years from data gathered from70,276 mother-child pairs enrolled in the Japan Environment and Children's Study. We collected data from pregnant women whose consent was obtained after the study was explained to them at participating facilities in the target area. Frequency of yogurt consumption was categorized into 0, 1-2, 3-4, and ≥ 5 times/week based on a questionnaire about the child's diet completed by the mother. Developmental delay was assessed using the Ages and Stages Questionnaires, Third Edition (ASQ-3™) in five domains: communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving, and personal-social. Using the results of the group that did not consume yogurt as a reference, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to compare the neurodevelopment of children according to frequency of yogurt consumption. For the covariates, items related to the socio-economic background and children's neurodevelopment were selected with reference to previous studies. RESULTS: Consumption of yogurt 1-4 times/week was associated with a reduced risk of developmental delay in all ASQ-3 categories(adjusted odds ratios, 0.71-0.87). However, the risk of developmental delay was not necessarily reduced with yogurt consumption ≥5 times/week (adjusted odds ratios, 0.84-0.96). CONCLUSION: Yogurt consumption habits at 1 year of age were associated with a lower risk of developmental delay at 3 years of age. However, the association was less apparent when yogurt was consumed more frequently. Possible mechanisms by which yogurt intake affects neurodevelopment include neurotransmitters produced by intestinal bacteria as well as the suppression of intestinal inflammation through improvements in the intestinal environment. Regular intake of yogurt in early childhood may have a positive association with neurodevelopment, but it is hoped that clearer links will be found in the future through intervention studies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is a common unfavorable consequence of antibiotics. Probiotic yogurt is equally effective as probiotic capsules, so it may provide a simple and cost-effective means of preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). The study aimed to evaluate the effect of probiotic yogurt on AAD among pediatric patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The randomized controlled trial design was adopted in this investigation, with a post-test-only control group. Data were obtained from 244 pediatric patients on antibiotics who were admitted to the hospital and included in the trial via full enumeration sampling. Selected subjects were randomly assigned to experimental (n = 122) or control (n = 122) groups. The experimental group received probiotic yogurt for five days, whereas the control group received standard care. The incidence and severity of diarrhea on the fifth day of the intervention were used to determine the study's results. The trial was registered with the Clinical Trials Registry - India (CTRI). Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) were followed. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for data analysis. Statistical software was used for descriptive and inferential analysis. RESULTS: AAD occurred in 13.90% and 36.88% of individuals in the experimental and control groups, respectively (odds ratio: p: 0.27:0.001). Further, yogurt intervention was found to be effective in terms of increasing the consistency of the stool (p. 001*), decreasing the duration and onset of diarrhea (P ≤ .001*), reducing the frequency and amount of loose stool (P ≤ .001*), reducing the urgency of defecation (P ≤ .001*), the presence of abdominal discomfort (P ≤ .001*), and dehydration (P ≤ .001*). CONCLUSION: In hospitals, antibiotics are commonly prescribed, and the most common side effect of medications is diarrhea. Probiotic yogurt guards against this side effect of antibiotics. Nurse practitioners need to understand the value of probiotic yogurt as a preventive measure that could save children's lives."

However, the underlying mechanism(s) by which yogurt consumption modulates the immune system have not been validated in human intervention studies. We hypothesized that 4-week yogurt consumption (12 oz/day) attenuates systemic inflammation by modulating the proportion of circulating T helper (Th) 17 and regulatory T (Treg) cells in adult women with elevated body mass index (BMI). To test the hypothesis, we conducted a randomized crossover dietary intervention study consisted of a 4-week dietary intervention in which participants consumed 12 oz of either low-fat dairy yogurt or a soy pudding control snack per day, with a 4-week washout between treatments. Thirty-nine healthy adult women with a BMI between 25 and 40 kg/m2 were enrolled and 20 completed the study. Changes in the biometrics, circulating T cells, and markers of systemic and colonic inflammation were assessed between the 2 treatment groups, as well as 24-hour diet recalls were conducted at baseline and following each treatment. The primary study outcome, the change in the proportion of circulating Th17 cells, was unaffected by the treatments. Secondary outcome measures, circulating Treg, Th17, and markers of chronic inflammation, were maintained by yogurt treatment, whereas circulating Treg was increased and interleukin-10 was reduced by control snack treatment. However, circulating Treg changes were not associated with changes to other biomarkers of inflammation, implying other immune cells and/or tissues may mediate circulating biomarkers of chronic inflammation.

In this study, the feasibility of enhancing the quality of skim milk yogurt through a combination of transglutaminase (TG) and protein-glutaminase (PG) was investigated. The combination of TG and PG resulted in simultaneous cross-linking and deamidation of CN micelles, with PG deamidation taking priority over TG cross-linking, leading to higher solubility and lower turbidity of milk proteins compared with TG alone. When 0.06 U/mL TG and 0.03 U/mL PG were added, firmness and viscosity indexes significantly increased by 38.26% and 78.59%, respectively, as compared with the control. Microscopic images revealed increased cross-linking with CN and filling of cavities by smaller submicelles in the combination of TG and PG treatment. Furthermore, the combination of TG and PG resolved issues of rough taste and whey separation, leading to improved overall liking. This study highlights the benefits of using both enzymes in dairy production and has important implications for future research.",

Experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated the antidiabetic, lipid-lowering, antiobesogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antihypertensive properties of cinnamon; therefore, its use in yogurt can help reverse the effects of these diseases. Our study aims to evaluate the effect of a microencapsulated aqueous extract of cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) (MCE Cz) incorporated in a yogurt drink on metabolic syndrome (MS) in a rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Physicochemical, microbiological, and proximal chemical characterization; total phenol, flavonoid, and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazil activity quantification; intestinal bioaccessibility; sensory analysis; MS induction through diet; and treatment with 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg of flavonoids contained in the MCE Cz were performed to help evaluate morphological, biochemical, and lipid peroxidation measurements in the liver and heart. The results show that the addition of MCE Cz in the yogurt modified the yogurt texture, increased its adhesiveness and firmness, and imparted a characteristic cinnamon color and biological value by providing intestinally bioaccessible antioxidants with antioxidant potential by reducing lipoperoxidation in the liver and heart after treatment. MCE Cz reduced the weight of the animals by up to 38.5% and the abdominal circumference by 29%. Biochemically, it decreased glucose levels by 24.38%, total cholesterol levels by 69.2%, triglyceride levels by 72.69%, and low-density lipoprotein levels by 89.25%; it increased high-density lipoprotein levels by 67.08%. Therefore, adding MCE Cz in doses of 5 and 10 mg of flavonoids in drinkable yogurt can be an alternative to preparing functional foods with physicochemical attributes and biological properties that can be consumed at all stages of life without undesirable effects. Moreover, it can act as a potential adjuvant in the treatment of comorbidities related to MS.",

OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to compare the effectiveness of S. persica and probiotic yogurt in the remineralization of tooth enamel on artificially produced enamel lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 40 intact human premolars were collected and each tooth was sectioned longitudinally into 2 identical halves in a buccolingual direction. The buccal halves were selected for inclusion in this study, and standardized windows (5 mm × 3 mm) were isolated on the buccal surface of the enamel. The samples were incubated in a demineralizing solution at 37°C for 96 h. Subsequently, they were randomly selected for treatment with one of the experimental remineralizing solutions (S. persica or probiotic yogurt). After treatment, the samples were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and polarized light microscopy at baseline, after demineralization and after remineralization. RESULTS: The remineralizing effect of S. persica was found to be greater than that of probiotic yogurt. With regard to mineral content, S. persica exhibited the highest calcium and phosphorus levels among all groups. No significant differences were observed between the samples treated with S. persica and normal enamel. CONCLUSIONS: Salvadora persica extract has been demonstrated to effectively reduce the demineralization of enamel in experimental conditions. Furthermore, it has the potential to restore the mineral content to its original level.",

      "abstract": "Probiotics have the potential to prevent disruptions to normal gastrointestinal function caused by oral antibiotic use. In this study, we examined the capacity of Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis BB-12 (BB-12) and yogurt, separately and combined, to mitigate the effects of the antibiotic amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMC) on the gut microbiota and metabolomes of C57BL/6 J mice. Male and female mice were administered either BB-12, yogurt, BB-12 in yogurt, or saline for 10 days concurrent with the inclusion of AMC in the drinking water. Male mice exposed to AMC exhibited significant reductions (p<0.05) in body weight over the course of the study compared to sham (no AMC) controls whereas no such effects were observed for female mice. AMC administration resulted in rapid alterations to the intestinal microbiota in both sexes irrespective of BB-12 or yogurt treatment, including significant (p<0.05) losses in bacterial cell numbers and changes in microbial alpha-diversity and beta-diversity in the feces and cecal contents. The effects of AMC on the gut microbiota were observed within one day of administration and the bacterial contents continued to change over time, showing a succession marked by rapid reductions in Muribaculaceae and Lachnospiraceae and temporal increases in proportions of Acholeplasmataceae (day 1) and Streptococcaceae and Leuconostocaceae (day 5). By day 10 of AMC intake, high proportions of Gammaproteobacteria assigned as Erwiniaceae or Enterobacteriaceae (average of 63 %), were contained in the stools and were similarly enriched in the cecum. The cecal contents of mice given AMC harbored significantly reduced concentrations of (branched) short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), aspartate, and other compounds, whereas numerous metabolites, including formate, lactate, and several amino acids and amino acid derivatives were significantly enriched. Despite the extensive impact of AMC, starting at day 7 of the study, the body weights of male mice given yogurt or BB-12 (in saline) with AMC were similar to the healthy controls. BB-12 (in saline) and yogurt intake was associated with increased Streptococcaceae and both yogurt and BB-12 resulted in lower proportions of Erwiniaceae in the fecal and cecal contents. The cecal contents of mice fed BB-12 in yogurt contained levels of formate, glycine, and glutamine that were equivalent to the sham controls. These findings highlight the potential of BB-12 and yogurt to mitigate antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis.",

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine effects of honey plus yogurt containing the probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DN-173 010/CNCM I-2494 (B. animalis) on intestinal transit time, probiotic enrichment, digestive health, mood, and cognition in adults. METHODS: Sixty-six healthy adults (34 female; 33.6 ± 9.8 y; 24.6 ± 3.0 kg/m2) in a crossover trial were randomly assigned to 2-wk yogurt conditions in a counterbalanced order with ≥4-wk washout: 1) Honey (HON): yogurt plus honey and 2) Negative Control (NC): heat-treated yogurt plus sugar. Of the participants, n = 62 completed the trial, and n = 37 (17 female; 32.0 ± 8.3 y; 25.0 ± 2.9 kg/m2) elected to enroll in a third condition (a nonrandomized study extension) after ≥4-wk washout with a reference Positive Control (PC): yogurt plus sugar. At baseline and end of each of the 3 conditions, intestinal transit time was measured with dye capsules; probiotic abundance with fecal DNA 16S sequencing; digestive health with symptom/function records, Bristol stool consistency, Gastrointestinal Tolerability, and Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index; mood with Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Short Form, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-42, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System questionnaires, and an emotional image task; and cognition with a spatial reconstruction task. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) with significance at P ≤ 0.05. Baseline and end data were included in the LMM, with fixed effects being treatment, time, treatment by time interaction, and baseline covariate, and the random effect being the participant. RESULTS: B. animalis was enriched in HON (d = 3.54; P = 0.0002) compared to controls with linear discriminant analysis effect size. Intestinal transit time, gastrointestinal health, mood, and cognition did not differ between conditions (LMM: Ps > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Yogurt + honey enriched B. animalis but did not reduce intestinal transit time or have other functional gastrointestinal, mood, or cognitive effects in adults.

      "abstract": "This work investigated the fermentation kinetics and characteristics of goat yogurt supplemented with bovine whey protein isolate (WPI) (0%, 2.5% and 5.0%) subjected to high shear dispersion (HSD) assisted by ultrasound (US). Protein supplementation and the physical processes increased the electronegativity of the zeta potential (≤60%), whereas particle size reduction was observed only with physical processes (≤42%). The addition of 2.5% WPI reduced yogurt fermentation time by 30 min. After 24 h of storage at 7 °C, lactic acid bacteria counts did not differ between samples (≥8 log CFU/mL), and the supplementation was sufficient to increase the apparent viscosity (≤5.65 times) and water-holding capacity (WHC) of the yogurt (≤35% increase). However, supplementation combined with physical processes promoted greater improvements in these parameters (6.41 times in apparent viscosity and 48% in WHC) (p < 0.05), as confirmed by the denser and better-organized protein clusters observed in microscopic evaluation. Thus, both approaches proved to be promising alternatives to improve goat yogurt quality. Therefore, the decision to adopt these strategies, either independently or in combination, should consider cost implications, the product quality, and market demand."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The effect of the daily consumption of a low-fat yogurt (150 g) enriched with Platelet-Activating Factor receptor (PAF-R) antagonists, or the plain one, on gut microbiota and faecal metabolites was investigated in healthy overweight subjects. METHODS: A randomized, three-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was performed that lasted 8 weeks. Blood and stools were collected and analyzed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that the intake of the enriched yogurt resulted in a significant increase in the levels of Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium perfringens group and Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio. On the other hand, a significant increase in the levels of Lactobacillus and C. perfringens group was detected after the intake of the plain yogurt. The increase in the levels of C. perfringens group was inversely associated with the plasma catabolic enzyme of PAF, namely LpPLA2 (lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2), a cardiovascular risk marker that has been linked with inflammation and atherosclerosis. Moreover, in the enriched with PAF-R antagonists yogurt group, the increased levels of C. perfringens group were also associated with lower PAF action assessed as ex vivo human platelet-rich plasma (PRP) aggregation. Additionally, a higher % increase in molar ratio of Branched Short Chain Fatty Acids (BSCFAs) was detected for both yogurt groups after the 8 week-intervention compared to control. The consumption of the enriched yogurt also resulted in a significant drop in faecal caproic levels and a trend for lower ratio of butyrate to total volatile fatty acids (VFAs) compared to baseline levels. CONCLUSION: Yogurt consumption seems to favorably affect gut microbiota while its enrichment with PAF-R antagonists from olive oil by-products, may provide further benefits in healthy overweight subjects.

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of probiotic yogurt on lipid metabolism and gut microbiota in metabolic-related fatty liver disease (MAFLD) golden hamsters fed on a high-fat diet (HFD). The results demonstrated that probiotic yogurt significantly reversed the adverse effects caused by HFD, such as body and liver weight gain, liver steatosis and damage, sterol deposition, and oxidative stress after 8 weeks of intervention. qRT-PCR analysis showed that golden hamsters fed HFD had upregulated genes related to adipogenesis, increased free fatty acid infiltration, and downregulated genes related to lipolysis and very low-density lipoprotein secretion. Probiotic yogurt supplements significantly inhibited HFD-induced changes in the expression of lipid metabolism-related genes. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the intestinal content microbiota suggested that probiotic yogurt changed the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota in HFD-fed hamsters. Probiotic yogurt decreased the ratio of the phyla Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, the relative abundance of the LPS-producing genus Desulfovibrio, and bacteria involved in lipid metabolism, whereas it increased the relative abundance of short-chain fatty acids producing bacteria in HFD-fed hamsters. Predictive functional analysis of the microbial community showed that probiotic yogurt-modified genes involved in LPS biosynthesis and lipid metabolism. In summary, these findings support the possibility that probiotic yogurt significantly improves HFD-induced metabolic disorders through modulating intestinal microflora and lipid metabolism and effectively regulating the occurrence and development of MAFLD. Therefore, probiotic yogurt supplementation may serve as an effective nutrition strategy for the treatment of patients with MAFLD clinically."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Dairy foods are often a major contributor to dietary saturated fatty acids (SFA) intake. However, different SFA-rich foods may not have the same effects on cardiovascular risk factors. We compared full-fat yogurt with low-fat yogurt and butter for their effects on cardiometabolic risk factors in healthy individuals. METHODS: Randomized, two-period crossover trial conducted from October 2022 to April 2023 among 30 healthy men and women (15 to receive full-fat yogurt first, and 15 to receive low-fat yogurt and butter first). Participants consumed a diet with 1.5-2 servings of full-fat (4%) yogurt or low-fat (< 1.5) yogurt and 10-15 g of butter per day for 4 weeks, with 4 weeks wash-out when they consumed 1.5-2 servings of low-fat milk. At baseline, and the end of each 4 weeks, fasting blood samples were drawn and plasma lipids, glycemic and inflammatory markers as well as expression of some genes in the blood buffy coats fraction were determined. RESULTS: All 30 participants completed the two periods of the study. Apolipoprotein B was higher for the low-fat yogurt and butter [changes from baseline, + 10.06 (95%CI 4.64 to 15.47)] compared with the full-fat yogurt [-4.27 (95%CI, -11.78 to 3.23)] and the difference between two treatment periods was statistically significant (p = 0.004). Non-high-density lipoprotein increased for the low-fat yogurt and butter [change, + 5.06 (95%CI (-1.56 to 11.69) compared with the full-fat yogurt [change, - 4.90 (95%CI, -11.61 to 1.81), with no significant difference between two periods (p = 0.056). There were no between-period differences in other plasma lipid, insulin, and inflammatory biomarkers or leukocyte gene expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 and CD36. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that short-term intake of SFAs from full-fat yogurt compared to intake from butter and low-fat yogurt has fewer adverse effects on plasma lipid profile.

In this work, to reduce beany off-flavors and anti-nutritional factors, and to improve its fermentation characteristics, soybean whey was treated with electrodialysis desalination, vacuum concentration and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) fermentation. The results showed that electrodialysis desalination increased the fermentation rate and the number of viable lactic acid bacteria of soybean whey yogurt. More than 90% of the antinutritional factor level (urease and trypsin inhibitory activity) was removed due to high-temperature denaturation inactivation and LAB degradation. Concentrated desalted soybean whey yogurt (CDSWY) possessed larger values for firmness and consistency, and a denser network microstructure compared with undesalted yogurt. Over 90% of off-flavors including hexanal, 1-octen-3-ol and 1-octen-3-one were removed after electrodialysis desalination and concentration treatment. Meanwhile, the newly generated β-damascenone through carotenoid degradation and 2,3-butanedione improved the pleasant flavor and sensory quality of CDSWY, while the salty taste of CSWY lowered its sensory quality. This study provided a theoretical basis for better utilization of soybean whey to develop a plant-based yogurt like dairy yogurt."

      "abstract": "Context: Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. One of the most common indications for probiotic treatment is the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Unfortunately, many probiotic products used for AAD are not supported by rigorous independent research, and often results in non-evidence-based usage. The overarching objective is to move research forward for the most well-studied Bifidobacterium strain. Objectives: The primary aim is to test the efficacy of high dose, BB-12-supplemented yogurt in preventing AAD, compared to yogurt without BB-12, in children receiving antibiotics. Other aims are to further assess the safety of yogurt supplemented with BB-12, and to carry out longitudinal community structure and gene expression analysis of fecal microbiota to evaluate the impact of high dose BB-12 in a pediatric population receiving antibiotics. The microbiota includes hundreds of species, and its disruption is hypothesized to be an important factor in the development of AAD. AIM 1: To test the efficacy of high dose, BB-12-supplemented yogurt in preventing AAD, compared to yogurt without BB-12, in children receiving antibiotics. Hypothesis: Children receiving antibiotics who receive the yogurt with BB-12 will demonstrate less diarrhea than those receiving a control yogurt without BB-12. This is a Phase II trial that requires additional safety evaluation of high dose BB-12. Hypotheses 3: Administration of antibiotics will alter the composition and gene expression profile of the gut microbiota in pediatric patients, and concomitant ingestion of BB-12 in yogurt will mitigate the antibiotic-induced disturbance in the gut microbiota, as identified using 16S rRNA and metatranscriptomic profiling. Study Design and Analysis: We will finish in the June 2023 a Phase II, randomized, doubleblinded controlled trial with allocation concealment. Setting: Capital Areal Primary Care Practice Based Research Network. Population Studied: 270 patients, ages 3-12 years, clinically diagnosed with a respiratory infection requiring 7-10 days of antibiotics. Interventions: The two arms are, BB-12-supplemented yogurt and non-supplemented control yogurt, in a 1:1 randomized allocation. Participants of all ages will be asked to consume the same dose, 100 ml, of product per day. The 100 ml serving of probiotic yogurt will deliver ≥1010 CFU of BB-12. The BB-12 probiotic was not be added.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Caribbean Latino adults are at high risk for osteoporosis yet remain underrepresented in bone research. This increased risk is attributed to genetics, diet, and lifestyle known to drive inflammation and microbial dysbiosis. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to determine whether consuming 5 oz of yogurt daily for 8wks improves bone turnover markers (BTMs) among Caribbean Latino adults > 50 years; and secondarily to determine the impact on the gut microbiota and markers of intestinal integrity and inflammation. METHODS: Following a 4wk baseline period, participants were randomized to an 8wk whole fat yogurt intervention (n = 10) daily, containing only Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, or to an untreated control group that did not consume yogurt (n = 10). Blood and stool samples collected at week-0 and week-8 were used to assess BTMs, inflammation, intestinal integrity biomarkers, and gut microbiota composition, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), respectively. Data were evaluated for normality and statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: Participants were 55% women, with a mean age of 70 ± 9 years, BMI 30 ± 6 kg/m2, and serum C-reactive protein 4.8 ± 3.6 mg/L, indicating chronic low-grade inflammation. Following 8wks of yogurt intake, absolute change in BTMs did not differ significantly between groups (P = 0.06-0.78). Secondarily, absolute change in markers of inflammation, intestinal integrity, and fecal SCFAs did not differ significantly between groups (P range 0.13-1.00). Yogurt intake for 8wks was significantly associated with microbial compositional changes of rare taxa (P = 0.048); however, no significant alpha diversity changes were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, daily yogurt did not improve BTMs, inflammation, intestinal integrity, nor SCFAs. However, yogurt did influence beta diversity, or the abundance of rare taxa within the gut microbiota of the yogurt group, compared to controls. Additional research to identify dietary approaches to reduce osteoporosis risk among Caribbean Latino adults is needed.

In addition, the influence of probiotic culture on blood lipid profiles was investigated for a period of 6 weeks.

All treatments showed a significant difference (p < 0.05) in acidity and pH during storage for 21 days at refrigeration temperature, while treatment with 100% probiotic culture (G2) was most prominent. Physicochemical analysis demonstrated a maximum pH decline of 0.60 in G2, followed by 0.56 in the mix cultured (G3). However, increasing trend was observed in acidity, with highest increment of 0.89% followed by 0.54% in G2 and G3, respectively. Storage study of total viable count demonstrated the reduction in the enumeration of microbial population owing to the production of organic acids, while L. acidophilus had a high survival rate of 5.25 log 10 CFU/g. Probiotic culture produced significant results in the lipid profile of subjects. Treatments containing probiotic bacteria G2 and G3 showed the lowest total cholesterol (183.57 and 182.85 mg/dL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) (105.80 106.40 mg/dL), respectively. In terms of high density lipoproteins (HDL), G2 showed a highest increment of 49.82 mg/dL.

Data showed that yogurt and lactate treatment significantly reduced the severity of psoriasis-like skin lesions, excessive keratinocyte proliferation, and immune cell infiltration. Mechanistically, we found that the genetic deficiency of the lactate receptor GPR81 aggravated psoriasis-like features in mice. Activation of the lactate/GPR81 axis inhibited the degradation of IκBα, prevented the nuclear translocation of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in macrophages, and thus constrained skin inflammation. Overall, these findings suggest that yogurt consumption effectively protects against experimental psoriasis and targeting the lactate/GPR81 signaling axis could be a promising approach for psoriasis inflammation management.",

Therefore, this study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the possibility of producing synbiotic yogurt sauce prepared with Spirulina platensis microalgae extract (SPAE) as a valuable and alternative product for mayonnaise. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After preparing yogurt from fresh cow's milk, synbiotic yogurt sauce was prepared according to the formulation, and the effect of SPAE at the rate of 0.5, 1, and 2% on the viability of the probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus was evaluated, and chemical, rheological, and sensory tests were carried out in the storage period (35 days). RESULTS: The highest viability rate of L. acidophilus was related to the treatment containing 2% of SPAE with 1.31 log CFU/g reduction (from 9.02 log CFU/g on the first day to 7.71 log CFU/g on the final day) and 1% of SPAE with 2.98 log CFU/g reduction, respectively, which were significantly more effective than other treatments (P < 0.05), and it was found that the viability rate increases with the increase in the percentage of the prebiotic composition. There was also a significant difference between the treatments in the simulating conditions of the digestive system, and the viability of L. acidophilus in the treatment containing the prebiotic composition increased (P < 0.05). According to the results, during storage, in the presence of microalgae, acidity increased, and pH, viscosity, and sensory properties decreased compared to the control group. Upon analyzing the results, it was found that the addition of the prebiotic composition of SPAE, which is known as a functional product, led to a partial improvement in its properties. Therefore, the use of this alga, while benefiting from its medicinal and therapeutic properties, increases the viability rate of probiotic.",

Our study aim was to compare the effects of three different low-cost and easy-to-use regimens with that of the gold standard (chlorhexidine [CHX] mouthwash) on the count of salivary S. mutans in dental students over 30 days. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-blinded parallel randomized controlled clinical trial, a total of 120 dental students were included and randomly allocated into four intervention groups: (1) CHX mouthwash (control(, (2) probiotic yogurt, (3) casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate chewing gum, and (4) xylitol chewing gum. Salivary S. mutans counts were evaluated at baseline, 15 days, and 30 days after initiation of the study and compared at different times and among different groups using the repeated measures analysis of variance design analysis and least significant difference test with SPSS software version 20. The level of significance was determined to be 0.05. RESULTS: The microorganism count variable at baseline, first, and second follow-ups was significantly different for all groups except the probiotic yogurt group (P = 0.340). S. mutans count was significantly different when comparing the first follow-up and baseline values in the CHX and xylitol gum groups (P = 0.027, P = 0.037). When comparing the second follow-up with baseline values, a significant difference was observed in the xylitol gum group (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Xylitol chewing gum seems to be a viable alternative to the gold standard (CHX mouthwash) in reducing the salivary count of S. mutans."

Numerous studies have indicated that the phytochemicals found in pepper possess antioxidant, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, and anti-arteriosclerotic properties. In this study, green pepper extract was used in yogurt to increase the acceptability of consumption and improve its health properties. For this purpose, green pepper extract was added in concentrations 100, 200, and 300 ppm in the preparation of yogurt. And pH, acidity, total content of phenolic compounds, DPPH inhibition percentage, viscosity, syneresis, and sensory properties were evaluated in 1, 7, 14, and 21 days after production. The results showed that by increasing the amount of extract, the percentage of antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds increased significantly. The effect of storage time on these indicators was also significant (p < 0.05). in such a way that over time, there was a decrease in antioxidant activity. But, there was a slight increase in antioxidant activity on the 14th day of storage. Also, the effect of treatment type on some physicochemical characteristics of yogurt containing green pepper extract including pH, acidity, viscosity, and syneresis was significant (p < 0.05). During storage, acidity, syneresis, and viscosity increased and pH decreased significantly in all yogurt samples. Regarding the tested sensory attributes, the 200 ppm sample received the highest score among the evaluators, and in terms of overall acceptance, the samples containing the extract were more favorable than the control sample."

This study investigated the effects of preprocessing methods on the nutritional properties of pumpkin and the physicochemical and sensory properties of pumpkin yogurt. Two different pumpkin varieties (Cucurbita pepo and Cucurbita maxima) were subjected to three different preprocessing methods (freeze-drying, boiling, and baking). Boiling significantly increased antioxidant activity (p ≤ .05), followed by baking. C. maxima had higher TDF and TPC than C. pepo, but in both pumpkin varieties, TDF did not change with heat treatment (boiling and baking), while TPC decreased. Mineral contents remained the same or decreased with heat treatment, except for Mn and Fe. In particular, the addition of C. maxima significantly affected the color parameters (L*, a*, b*) of yogurt and improved WHC (from 68.9% to 91.6%) and hardness (from 58.0 to 193.5 g; p ≤ .05). The sensory evaluation concluded that heat-treated (boiled and baked) samples were preferred more than freeze-dried raw ones. In conclusion, the results revealed that adding boiled and baked pumpkins, especially the preference for C. maxima instead of C. pepo, improved the quality parameters of yogurt."

      "abstract": "SCOPE: Epidemiological studies indicate an inverse correlation between yogurt consumption and colorectal cancer (CRC), but whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship has not yet been validated. This study aims to investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of yogurt on colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) in mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Experimental CAC is induced by azoxymethane (AOM, 10 mg kg-1 , ip) followed by three cycles of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, 3%) treatment. Colitis is induced by adding DSS (3%) in drinking water for 5 days. Primary mouse macrophages are isolated for mechanistic studies. Data clearly show that yogurt (15 g kg-1 body weight) significantly reduces the multiplicity of colonic neoplasms by 38.83% in mice. Yogurt protects mice from colitis dependent on lactate receptor GPR81. The deficiency of Gpr81 exacerbates colitis and CAC in mice. Further investigation reveals that GPR81 may be dispensable for gut barrier function but essential for colonic mucosal repair. d-lactate in yogurt can activate GPR81 to suppress proinflammatory macrophage polarization, thereby facilitating inflammatory resolution after colonic injury and consequently suppressing CAC progression. CONCLUSION: Yogurt effectively protects against colitis-associated colorectal tumorigenesis in mice, and this study provides a rationale for introducing yogurt supplementation to patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.",

Here, rice starches were physically modified via heat-moisture treatment (HMT) using different amylose (high, medium, low, and waxy) and moisture (15 %, 20 %, 25 %, and 30 %) contents. Hydration properties and pasting viscosities differed for different amylose and moisture contents. The HMT starch with high amylose content and 15 % moisture (High_HMT15) exhibited the highest final viscosity (6.16 Pa.s), and 31.7 % and 35.1 % increased amount of resistant starch compared to native starch in the granule and paste states, respectively. Hence, High_HMT15 was used as a stabilizer for nonfat yogurt. The nonfat yogurt prepared with 1.0 % High_HMT15 as the stabilizer exhibited 37.3 % reduced whey separation, 2.8 times increased viscosity, a high total solids content, and acceptable sensory properties compared to the nonfat yogurt without starch. These HMT starches can replace chemically modified starches derived from other grains in various food applications.",

      "abstract": "Nutritional therapy, which may have advantages over medication, is being investigated as a novel treatment for pregnancy-induced hypertension. Several studies have shown that probiotic yogurt supplementation during pregnancy has beneficial effects on maternal and fetal health. In this study, fermented buffalo milk was produced with yogurt culture and Lactobacillus plantarum B, a probiotic isolated from healthy breast milk with high angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity. The fermentation conditions under which the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity reached 84.51% were optimized by the response surface method as follows: 2 × 106 cfu/mL of L. plantarum B, yogurt culture 2.5 × 105 cfu/mL, and 8 h at 37°C. The distribution of ACE inhibitory peptides from fermented buffalo milk and fermented cow milk were further analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. By searching according to the structural features of ACE inhibitory peptides, 29 and 11 peptides containing ACE inhibitory peptide features were found in fermented buffalo milk and fermented cow milk, respectively. To investigate the in vivo antihypertensive activity of fermented buffalo milk, 18 pregnant rats were divided into 3 groups (n = 6 in each group) and administered 10 mL of normal saline, yogurt (20 mg/kg), or labetalol hydrochloride (4 mg/kg) daily from the beginning of pregnancy to parturition. To induce hypertension, methyl nitrosoarginine (125 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously every day from d 15 of pregnancy to the day of delivery. Blood pressure was not significantly changed in the yogurt and labetalol groups after induction of hypertension and was lower compared with the normal saline group, but there was no difference between the yogurt and labetalol groups. This implied that the buffalo yogurt had a preventive and antihypertensive effect in the pregnancy-induced hypertensive rat model. Further studies to determine the mechanism of action, as well as a randomized control trial, are warranted.",

The antibiotic therapy utilized for treating H. pylori can lead to undesired side effects, such as dysbiosis in the gut microbiota. The objective of our study was to explore the potential antibacterial effects of nisin and lactic acid (LA) in yogurt against H. pylori. Additionally, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of nisin and LA in human gastric (AGS) cells infected with H. pylori. Nisin and LA combination showed the strongest inhibitory activity, with confirmed synergy at 0.375 fractional inhibitory concentration index. Also, post-fermented yogurt with incorporation of nisin exhibited antibacterial effect against H. pylori. The combination of nisin and LA resulted in a significant reduction of mRNA levels of bacterial toxins of H. pylori and pro-inflammatory cytokines in AGS cells infected with H. pylori. Furthermore, this also increased bacterial membrane damage, which led to DNA and protein leakage in H. pylori. Overall, the combination of nisin and LA shows promise as an alternative therapy for H. pylori infection. Additionally, the incorporation of nisin into foods containing LA presents a potential application. Further studies, including animal research, are needed to validate these findings and explore clinical applications."

      "abstract": "Set yogurt's physical characteristics are greatly affected by the homogenization and heat treatment processes. In our previous study, set yogurt treated at 130°C and with the fat particle size reduced to ≤0.6 μm had equivalent curd strength, less syneresis and smoother texture than yogurt treated at 95°C. When investigating the mechanisms underlying yogurt's physical properties, it is important to evaluate the yogurt's microstructure. We conducted electron microscopy evaluations to investigate the mechanisms of changes in yogurt's physical properties caused by 130°C heat treatment and by a reduction in the fat globule size. We prepared yogurt mixtures by combining heat treatment at 95 and 130°C and homogenization pressure at 10 + 5 and 35 + 5 MPa and then fermented the mixtures in a common yogurt starter. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used for the structural observations. Fine particles were observed on the surface of the casein micelles of the yogurt treated at 95°C, and the coalescence density between micelles was high. The surface of the yogurt treated at 130°C had few fine particles, and the coalescence density between micelles was low. The yogurt treated at 130°C with 35 + 5 MPa homogenization had low coalescence density between casein micelles, but smaller-particle-size fat globules increased the network density. Approximately 30% of the fat globules were estimated to be incorporated into the yogurt networks compared to the volume of casein micelles. We speculate that 130°C heat treatment alters the structure of whey protein on the surface of casein micelles and interferes with network formation, but reducing the size of fat globules reinforces the network as a pseudoprotein.",

They were subjected to analysis of resistant starch, lactose, fat, total dry extract, defatted dry extract, moisture, ash, proteins, pH and titratable acidity; syneresis analysis, instrumental texture and instrumental color. All four formulations met the requirements of the identity and quality regulation for fermented milks regarding the physicochemical and microbiological parameters. In the instrumental color analysis, in all treatments with added BBV, darkening was observed after 21 days, with a reduction of a* coordinate and an increase of b* coordinate. In the instrumental texture analysis, the yogurt in the Control treatment had the highest firmness (0.430 N) at 21 days among these treatments. Among the treatments with added BBV, the yogurt with 5% added BBV showed the best results for increasing the viability of lactic bacteria. It was found that yogurt with added BBV is a promising alternative in the elaboration of functional dairy products, adding value to the banana production chain by reducing the green fruit waste.",

All of the tested yogurts maintained a remarkable number of viable colony counts (≥7.23 log CFU/mL) during the storage. Ultrasonication significantly (p < 0.05) changed the L, a*, and b* color values. The ultrasonic processing reduced whey syneresis and improved the water-holding capacity in fresh and stored yogurts. Further, it retained the fatty acid profile of fortified yogurts. However, ultrasonication negatively affected, i.e., reduced the total polyphenol content and antioxidant activity of yogurts as compared to the conventionally (thermal) treated counterparts. Overall, ultrasound technology can be a potential alternative to thermal treatment for the improved quality and safety of fortified yogurts.",

We conducted a three-arm pilot randomized controlled trial: (1) nutrition education for mothers; (2) nutrition education plus a daily yogurt supplement (50 g) for the index child; and (3) usual care (control). Dyads of children aged 4-6 months and at risk of stunting [length-for-age z-score (LAZ) ≤ -1 SD and >-2 SD] and their mothers with ≤10 years of education were eligible for the study. Participants were recruited from five slum areas in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Intention-to-treat (N = 162) and complete-case analyses (N = 127) showed no between-group statistically significant differences in LAZ or weight-for-age (WAZ). However, the yogurt group showed greater change in linear growth compared to the control (LAZ: mean difference 0.20, 95% CI: -0.06, 0.47, p-value 0.13), which was also slightly greater than the education-only group. Children in the yogurt plus group were five times (95% CI: 0.80, 31.80, p-value 0.09) more likely to meet the minimum dietary diversity (MDD) score compared to the control. A 3-month follow-up of this pilot study did not demonstrate that yogurt was beneficial to linear growth. However, there were encouraging trends that merit replication of the intervention with larger samples and longer follow-ups.",

      "abstract": "Yak yogurt, which is rich in microorganisms, is a naturally fermented dairy product prepared with ancient and modern techniques by Chinese herdsmen in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The objective of this research was to assess the impact of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus starter cultures on the quality and shelf life of yak yogurt, as well as the genetic stability across multiple generations, in comparison to commercially available plain yogurt and peach oat flavor yogurt. Following that, the samples were evenly divided into four treatment groups denoted as T1 (treatment 1), T2, T3, and T4, with each group employing a distinct source of yogurt formulation. T1 included L. bulgaricus, T2 comprised S. thermophilus, T3 consisted of plain yogurt, and T4 represented peach oat yogurt flavor. The findings indicate that T1 yogurt consistently presents a lower pH and higher acidity compared to the other three yogurt types throughout the entire generation process. Moreover, the fat content in all generations of the four yogurt types exceeds the national standard of 3.1 g/100 g, while the total solid content shows a tendency to stabilize across generations. The protein content varies significantly among each generation, with T1 and T4 yogurt indicating higher levels compared to the T2 and T3 yogurt groups. In terms of overall quality, T1 and T4 yogurt are superior to T2 and T3 yogurt, with T1 yogurt being the highest in quality among all groups. The findings revealed that the inclusion of L. bulgaricus led to enhanced flavor, texture, and genetic stability in yak yogurt. This study will serve as a valuable source of data, support, and methodology for the development and screening of compound starters to be utilized in milk fermentation in future research and applications.",

Probiotic supplementation has been shown to modulate gut microbiota composition and improve exercise performance. This study aimed to investigate the effect of probiotic yogurt supplementation on gut microbiota and its relationship with exercise-related psychological fatigue in female taekwondo athletes. METHODS: Twenty female taekwondo athletes were randomly assigned to either a dietary intervention group (DK) or a control group (CK). The athletes' exercise-related psychological fatigue was measured using the Athlete Burnout Questionnaire (ABQ) before and after an 8-week intervention. High-throughput sequencing was used to profile the gut microbiota, and functional prediction of the microbial community was performed. The effect of the dietary intervention on the athletes' exercise-related psychological fatigue clearance rate and its relationship with the gut microbiota were explored. RESULTS: (1) The probiotic supplementation of Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 for 8 weeks significantly increased the ABQ scores of the DK group compared to the CK group (p < 0.05). (2) The abundances of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae, family _Lactobacillaceae, and genus _Lactobacillus were significantly higher in the DK group than in the CK group after probiotic supplementation, while Escherichia coli was significantly lower in the DK group than in the CK group. (3) The ABQa scores were positively correlated with Proteus; ABQb scores were positively correlated with Streptococcus and Enterococcus; and ABQc scores were positively correlated with Klebsiella, Bacteroides, and Streptomyces. (4) The DK group had significantly higher levels of L-arginine biosynthesis I (via L-ornithine), fatty acid biosynthesis and oxidation, and L-isoleucine biosynthesis III pathways compared to the CK group. Tyrosine degradation I (via 2,3-dihydroxyphenylpropionate) was significantly lower in the DK group than in the CK group. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic yogurt supplementation of Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis can promote the clearance of exercise-related psychological fatigue in female taekwondo athletes by upregulating beneficial gut microbiota, inhibiting harmful gut microbiota, and regulating relevant metabolic pathways."

The addition of stabilizers improves the body, texture, appearance, and mouth feel of yogurt while also preventing technical defects such as syneresis. A study was conducted to optimize the concentration of taro starch in yogurt. The yogurt was fortified at different concentrations of taro starch. Taro starch levels were 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, and 3%, with different storage times (0, 14, and 28 days). The Tukey honesty test was used for mean comparison (p < .1). The results of the study showed that maximum moisture and protein content was taken by using 0.5% taro starch and stored for 0 days while maximum fat % was attained in 1.5% taro starch treatment and storage time was 0 days. The maximum water-holding capacity was increased by adding 1.5% taro starch under 14 days' storage time. Water-holding capacity started decreasing with the increasing taro concentration. The acidity of yogurt started increasing with the increasing taro starch and the maximum acidity was taken at 2.5% taro starch concentration. The viscosity of the yogurt was maximum at 2% taro starch. As far as it concerned, sensory evolution, aroma, and taste started changing with the increasing taro starch concentration and increasing storage time. The study's goals were to optimize the taro concentration for stabilizing the yogurt synthesis and to probe the impact of taro starch on the physiochemical attributes of yogurt."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome is recognized as one of the most common global health issues, which may cause numerous side effects. Studies have shown the favorable effects of probiotic supplements on glycemic indices, lipid profiles, and oxidative stress status. However, the number of studies investigating the effects of food products containing probiotics and prebiotics on metabolic diseases is limited. Limited evidence also shows that products containing Lactobacillus plantarum could affect metabolic alterations in chronic diseases. No previous study evaluated the impact of synbiotic yogurt containing Lactobacillus plantarum on people with metabolic syndrome. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the effect of the newly developed synbiotic yogurt containing Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus pentosus, and Chloromyces marcosianos yeast on the components of metabolic syndrome, oxidative stress status, and some other risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in adults with metabolic syndrome. METHODS: In this study, 44 patients with metabolic syndrome will be randomly assigned to intervention and control groups in a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. Participants in the intervention group will consume 300 g of synbiotic yogurt daily, while those in the control group will consume 300 g of regular yogurt daily for 12 weeks. Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, and biochemical parameters will be evaluated before and after the intervention. DISCUSSION: The management of the metabolic syndrome presents significant clinical challenges. While probiotic supplementation for these individuals has been considered, the consumption of probiotic-rich foods has received considerably less attention.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: We unravel the effect of anthocyanin-containing purple sweet potato synbiotic yogurt (PSPY) on 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and its fundamental molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Molecular docking simulation was performed to observe and identify the affinity and interaction between bioactive compounds and targeted proteins. MDI (isobutylmethylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin)-containing medium, a cocktail that stimulates adipogenesis, was used in this study. The toxic effect possibility of the yogurt product was evaluated using 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2.5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. A 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, and 5% (v/v) plain or purple sweet potato yogurt supernatant was given to 3T3-L1 preadipocyte culture medium from 24 h after seeding until day 11 of MDI-induced differentiation. The mRNA expression and lipid accumulation were analyzed using RT-qPCR and Oil red O staining, respectively, on day 11 after differentiation induction. RESULTS: In silico study suggested that anthocyanin-derived compounds have the potential to inhibit peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), a master regulator for white adipogenesis. Anthocyanin-containing PSPY significantly suppressed the expression of Pparg, Adipoq, Slc2a4, and Pgc1a. PSPY significantly suppressed Pparg with 1% and 5% concentrations, while with a concentration of 0.25%, PSPY significantly suppressed Adipoq expression as compared to control. Significant inhibition of Slc2a4 and Pgc1a was observed starting from a 0.25% concentration of PSPY. The suppression of adipogenic genes was also observed with the treatment of plain yogurt; however, the effects were relatively lower than the PSPY. The group treated with 1% and 5% of PSPY also showed inhibition effects on lipid accumulation. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated PSPY inhibition effect on white adipocyte differentiation through suppression of Pparg and its downstream genes, Adipoq and Slc2a4, indicating the potential of this yogurt as a functional food for obesity management and prevention."

      "abstract": "Plant-based yogurt has several advantages over traditional yogurt, such as being lactose and cholesterol-free, making it more suitable for individuals with cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases. The formation mechanism of the gel in plant-based yogurt needs more attention because it is associated with the gel properties of yogurt. Most plant proteins, except for soybean protein, have poor functional abilities, such as solubility and gelling properties, which limits their application in most food items. This often results in undesirable mechanical quality of plant-based products, particularly plant-based yogurt gels, including grainy texture, high syneresis, and poor consistency. In this review, we summarize the common formation mechanism of plant-based yogurt gel. The main ingredients, including protein and non-protein components, as well as their interactions involved in the gel are discussed to understand their effects on gel formation and properties. The main interventions and their effects on gel properties are highlighted, which have been shown to improve the properties of plant-based yogurt gels effectively. Each type of intervention method may exhibit desirable advantages in different processes. This review provides new opportunities and theoretical guidance for efficiently improving the gel properties of plant-based yogurt for future consumption.",

      "abstract": "Yogurt, produced by the lactic fermentation of milk base, is an important dairy product worldwide. One of the essential sensory properties of yogurt is the texture, and some textural defects such as weak gel firmness and syneresis likely occur in various types of yogurts, affecting consumer acceptance. In this regard, various strategies such as enrichment of milk-based with different additives and ingredients such as protein-based components (skimmed milk powder (SMP), whey protein-based powders (WP), casein-based powders (CP), and suitable stabilizers, as well as modification of processing conditions (homogenization, fermentation, and cooling), can be applied in order to reduce syneresis. The most effective proteins and stabilizers in syneresis reduction are CP and gelatin, respectively. Furthermore, yogurt's water holding capacity and syneresis can be affected by the type of starter cultures, the protolithic activity, production of extracellular polysaccharides, and inoculation rate. Moreover, optimizing the heat treatment process (85 °C/30 min and 95 °C/5 min), homogenization (single or dual-stage), incubation temperature (around 40 °C), and two-step cooling process can decrease yogurt syneresis. This review is aimed to investigate the effect of fortification of the milk base with various additives and optimization of process conditions on improving texture and preventing syneresis in yogurt."

This study provides a direct alternative treatment of YAW by leveraging the abilities of Mucor circinelloides and Mucor genevensis to raise the pH of YAW and to produce fungal biomass with a high lipid content. Aerobic cultivations of these species were conducted in YAW, both with and without the addition of lactase, at 30 °C, and 200 rpm agitation. The density, pH, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), biomass production, lipid content, fatty acid profile, and sugar and lactic acid concentrations were regularly measured throughout the 14-day cultivations. The data showed that M. genevensis was superior at deacidifying YAW to a pH above 6.0-the legal limit for disposing of cultured dairy waste. On the other hand, M. circinelloides generated more fungal biomass, containing up to 30% w/w of lipid with high proportions of oleic acid and γ-linolenic acid. Additionally, the treatments with lactase addition showed a significant decrease in the BOD. In conclusion, our results present a viable treatment to increase the pH of YAW and decrease its BOD, meanwhile generating fungal oils that can be further transformed into biodiesel or processed into functional foods or dietary supplements."

The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of adding two types of retrograded corn starch with different amylose content to a non-strained type of Greek-style yogurt. Retrograded starch from starch containing 27 % (RNS) or 70 % (RHS) amylose was added to yogurt at 0, 10, 12.5, or 15 g/100 g before storage at 4 °C for 14 d. The resistant starch (RS) content, pH, syneresis, flow behavior index, and consistency index, were measured every week. A sensory test was carried out in yogurt added with 12.5 g/100 g of retrograded starches to evaluate acceptance. Adding retrograded starch significantly reduced syneresis while increased the consistency, firmness, and resistant starch content of the yogurt. No significant differences in general acceptance were observed in samples added with RNS when compared to the control. Although a significant difference was observed after adding RHS, the acceptance of the product is still convenient. Adding a high concentration of retrograded starch could help to ensure doses enough for a prebiotic effect of RS with concentrations of 1.74 ± 0.37 to 2.32 ± 0.09 g/100 g and from 3.5 ± 0.08 to 4.21 ± 0.08 g/100 g when RNS or RHS is added respectively, while maintaining the quality characteristics of Greek-style yogurt during storage without compromising the acceptability.",

The fortification of β-carotene in yogurt using pumpkin flesh (PF) could be a very cost-effective public health intervention. The current study aimed to analyze the proximate, functional, microbial, textural, and sensory properties of yogurt fortified with PF to evaluate its suitability as a β-carotene enriched food. The research was conducted with three treatments, control set-type yogurt (CSY) with no PF, 15% PF-fortified set-type yogurt (15PFSY), and 20% PF-fortified set-type yogurts (20PFSY) followed by pumpkin pie spice and ground pumpkin seed to improve consumer acceptability. The fortified yogurt with 20PFSY and 15PFSY contained a higher amount of β-carotene, protein, fiber, and ash, and lower carbohydrate, fat, and energy in compression with CSY, which might attract health-conscious people. In addition, viable bacterial count, firmness, consistency, cohesiveness, and viscosity index were found better in fortified yogurt. Based on reports of sensory panellists, 15PFSY achieved a significantly (p < 0.01) highest overall acceptability than 20PFSY and CSY. These findings suggest that pumpkin-fortified yogurt could be used widely as a nutrient-enriched fermented food. In addition, as a β-carotene (vitamin-A) fortified yogurt, it could be a potential alternative to prevent or reduce blindness in children with minimal cost."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Gestational diabetes mellitus is one of the important complications of pregnancy and is related to many adverse events. There is evidence that probiotics can be considered a preventive and therapeutic option in gestational diabetes mellitus. In this meta-analysis, we have focused on the effect of probiotic yogurt as a natural product on gestational diabetes mellitus. METHODS: A systematic literature search was done through PUBMED/Medline, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and EBSCO up to December 2022. This meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for the evaluation of the effect of probiotic yogurt on gestational diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: Four manuscripts with a total of 533 participants were included in this meta-analysis. There was a statistically significant association between probiotic yogurt and reduced risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (Pooled OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.19-0.62; I2 = 0.0%). Furthermore, the mean reduction in the fasting plasma glucose was significantly higher in the probiotic yogurt groups (Hedges' g = -0.37; 95% CI -0.68 to -0.05; I2 = 0.0%). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that probiotic yogurt lowers the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus. Also, it is related to a significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose. These findings promise that probiotic yogurt could be regarded as a safe and low-cost therapy and preventive option for gestational diabetes mellitus. However, more randomized controlled trials with different doses and more probiotic strains with varying systems of delivery are warranted.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hempseeds (Cannabis sativa L.) are rich in easily digestible proteins, fats, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and insoluble fiber and are of high nutritional value. Probiotics have been found to relieve constipation, which solves a health problem that constantly troubles a lot of people. Therefore, the changes in the metabolites of fermented yogurt with or without 10% defatted hempseed meal (10% SHY or 0% SHY respectively) were studied and their laxative effects were examined through animal experiments. RESULTS: Amino acids and peptides, terpene glycosides, carbohydrates, lineolic acids, and fatty acids were found to be the major contributors to the discrimination of the metabolic profile between 0% SHY and 10% SHY. The differentially accumulated metabolites may lead to the discrepancy in the yogurt's functionality. Animal experiments showed that the 10% SHY treatment prevented constipation by increasing feces number, fecal water content, and small intestinal transit rate and reducing inflammatory injury in loperamide-induced constipated rats. Further analysis of the gut microbiota revealed that 10% SHY gavage increased the relative abundances of the Lactobacillus, Allobaculum, Turicibacter, Oscillibacter, Ruminococcus, and Phascolarctobacterium genera in the constipated rats, whereas Akkermansia, Clostridium_XIVa, Bacteroides, Staphylococcus, and Clostridium_IV were decreased. The combination of defatted hempseed meal and probiotics was found to be effective in relieving constipation, probably due to the enriched amino acids and peptides, such as Thr-Leu and lysinoalanine through correlation analysis. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that defatted hempseed meal in yogurt altered the metabolic profile and effectively alleviated constipation in rats, which is a promising therapeutic candidate for constipation. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Growing body of evidence hypothesized that probiotics intake may be useful for patients with T2DM. We investigated the effect of probiotic yogurt consumption on glycemic control and lipid profile in patients with T2DM. METHODS: In this 12-week randomized controlled clinical trial, seventy-two patients with T2DM were randomly assigned to the intervention group (IG) that received 200 g/d probiotic yogurt containing 4.65 × 106 CFU/g Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis) or placebo group (PG) that received 200 g/d conventional yogurt. RESULTS: We found no difference between two groups in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c) and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c) after intervention. After adjusting for baseline values of covariate, a significant reduction in HbA1c (mean change: -0.76 ± 1.3 vs. -0.15 ± 1.3; P = 0.01), TC (mean change: -10.61 ± 27.8 vs. -2.97 ± 35.0; P = 0.02) and LDL-c (mean change: -8.62 ± 21.7 vs. 0.02 ± 25.8; P = 0.004) was observed in the IG compared to the PG. In addition, a non-significant trend to reduction was observed in term of FPG (mean change: -19.61 ± 29.1 vs. -4.19 ± 24.2; P = 0.13). TG and HDL-c remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic yogurt consumption may be useful for patients with T2DM. More well-designed clinical trials with longer intervention duration are required.

      "abstract": "Maternal obesity is a key predictor of childhood obesity and a determining factor for a child's body composition. Thus, any form of maternal nutrition during the gestational period plays a vital role in influencing the growth of the fetus. Elateriospermum tapos (E. tapos) yogurt has been found to comprise many bioactive compounds such as tannins, saponins, α-linolenic acid, and 5'-methoxy-bilobate with apocynoside I that could cross the placenta and exhibit an anti-obesity effect. As such, this study aimed to investigate the role of maternal E. tapos yogurt supplementation on offspring body composition. In this study, 48 female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were induced with obesity using a high-fat diet (HFD) and were allowed to breed. Upon confirmation of pregnancy, treatment was initiated with E. tapos yogurt on the obese dams up to postnatal day 21. The weaning offspring were then designated into six groups according to their dam's group (n = 8) as follows; normal food and saline (NS), HFD and saline (HS), HFD and yogurt (HY), HFD and 5 mg/kg of E. tapos yogurt (HYT5), HFD and 50 mg/kg of E. tapos yogurt (HYT50), and HFD and 500 mg/kg of E. tapos yogurt (HYT500). The body weight of the offspring was accessed every 3 days up to PND 21. All the offspring were euthanized on PND 21 for tissue harvesting and blood sample collection. The results showed that both male and female offspring of obese dams treated with E. tapos yogurt showed growth patterns similar to NS and reduced levels of triglycerides (TG), cholesterol, LDL, non-HDL, and leptin. Liver enzymes such as ALT, ALP, AST, GGT, and globulin, and renal markers such as sodium, potassium, chloride, urea, and creatinine levels significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in the offspring of E. tapos yogurt-treated obese dams with the normal histological architecture of the liver, kidney, colon, RpWAT, and visceral tissue that is comparable to NS. In toto, E. tapos yogurt supplementation of obese dams exerted an anti-obesity effect by preventing intergenerational obesity by reversing HFD-induced damage in the fat tissue of the offspring.",

      "abstract": "Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are industrially important bacteria that are widely used in the fermented food industry, especially in the manufacture of yogurt. The fermentation characteristics of LAB are an important factor affecting the physicochemical properties of yogurts. Here, different ratios of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus IMAU20312 and S. thermophilus IMAU80809 were compared with a commercial starter JD (control) for their effects on viable cell counts, pH values, titratable acidity (TA), viscosity and water holding capacity (WHC) of milk during fermentation. Sensory evaluation and flavour profiles were also determined at the end of fermentation. All samples had a viable cell count above 5.59 × 107 CFU/mL at the end of fermentation, and a significant increase in TA and decrease in pH were observed. Viscosity, WHC and the sensory evaluation results of one treatment ratio (A3) were closer to the commercial starter control than the others. A total of 63 volatile flavour compounds and 10 odour-active (OAVs) compounds were detected in all treatment ratios and the control according to the results from solid-phase micro-extraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS). Principal components analysis (PCA) also indicated that the flavour characteristics of the A3 treatment ratio were closer to the control. These results help us understand how the fermentation characteristics of yogurts are affected by the ratio of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus to S. thermophilus in starter cultures; this is useful for the development of value-added fermented dairy products.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of bovine milk and yogurt on selected oral microorganisms and different oral biofilms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Milk was prepared from 0.5% fat (low-fat) and 16% fat (high fat) milk powder. For yogurt preparation, the strains Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgarcius and Streptococcus thermophilus were added to the milk. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimal microbiocidal concentrations (MMC) of the test compounds were measured against various microorganisms by the microbroth dilution technique. Cariogenic periodontal biofilms and one containing Candida were created on plastic surfaces coated with test substances. Further, preformed biofilms were exposed to the test substances at a concentration of 100% for 10 min and thereafter 10% for 50 min. Both colony forming units (cfu) and metabolic activity were quantified in the biofilms. RESULTS: Neither high-fat milk, low-fat milk nor casein inhibited the growth of any species. Yogurt and L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus at low MIC and MMC suppressed the growth of Porphyromonas gingivalis and other bacteria associated with periodontal disease. High-fat yogurt decreased cfu in the forming periodontal biofilm by 90%. Both low- and high-fat yogurts reduced metabolic activity in newly forming and preformed periodontal and Candida biofilms, but not in the cariogenic biofilm. CONCLUSIONS: Yogurt and L. delbru eckii ssp. bulgaricus, but not milk, were bactericidal against periodontopathogenic bacteria. Yoghurt reduced the metabolic activity of a Candida biofilm and a periodontal biofilm. Yogurt and L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus may have potential in prevention and therapy of periodontal diseases and Candida infections.",

OBJECTIVES: In this study we aimed to investigate the benefits of a novel dietary treatment (50% calorie restriction diet composed of yogurt, fruit, and vegetables [CR-YD]) in mice with MetS. METHODS: Forty 7-wk-old male C57BL/6 J mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups (n = 10/group) that were fed for 14 wk ad libitum with a normal diet (ND; 10%:70%:20% energy from fat: carbohydrate: protein) or for 12 wk with a high-fat diet (HFD; 60:20:20) or the HFD followed by 2 wk of feeding with a 50% calorie-restricted HFD (CR-HFD) or YD (CR-YD, 21.2%:65.4%:13.4% energy). Body weight, fat deposition, hepatic steatosis, serum concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers, and glucose homeostasis were assessed. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was used to validate the roles of gut microbiota in MetS. RESULTS: The HFD group had 50% greater body weight and 475% greater fat deposition than the ND group (P < 0.05). Compared with the HFD group, the CR-HFD and CR-YD groups had 22% and 31% lower body weight and 49% and 75% less fat deposition, respectively (P < 0.05). Compared with the CR-HFD group, the CR-YD group had 11% lower body weight, 96% less fat deposition, 500% less hepatic steatosis, 75% lower glucose, and 450% more hepatic Akkermansia bacteria (P < 0.05). The CR-YD group also had 50% lower histopathology scores and 1.35-fold higher levels of Claudin4 than the CR-HFD group (P < 0.05). The HFD + CR-YD fecal group had 10.6% lower body weight, 119% lower steatosis, and 17.9% lower glucose (P < 0.05) than the HFD + CR-HFD fecal group. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with CR alone, the CR-YD diet has a better therapeutic effect in mice with HFD-induced MetS.",

The effects of PEF treatment parameters, voltage (4-20 kV), pulse number (20-80 pulses), frequency (1-21 Hz), and pulse (5-8 µs) width on pH development, cell counts, and proteolytic activity, as well as on texture and degree of syneresis in yogurt were investigated by use of a two-level full factorial design. Pulse frequency and pulse width had a significant effect on the yogurt stiffness (p < 0.05) and the interaction of voltage and frequency had a significant effect on both stiffness and proteolytic activity (p < 0.05). Further experiments confirmed that pre-treatment of the dairy culture with specific PEF parameters immediately before addition to milk could accelerate fermentation of, increase stiffness of, and reduce syneresis in the final yogurt. This effect of the PEF-pre-treated culture was partially retained even after flash-freezing and 14 days of storage of the culture at -20 °C. The effects were attributed to responses to oxidative stress induced by the PEF pre-treatment."

RESULTS: Aspergillus niger NRC114 α-galactosidase was purified using protein precipitation, gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography steps, which resulted in a 123-fold purification. The purified enzyme was found to be 64 kDa using the SDS-PAGE approach. The optimum pH and temperature of the purified α-galactosidase were detected at pH 3.5 and 60 ºC, respectively. The pure enzyme exhibited potent acidic pH stability at pH 3.0 and pH 4.0 for 2 h, and it retained its full activity at 50 ºC and 60 ºC for 120 min and 90 min, respectively. The enzyme was activated using 2.5 mM of K+, Mg2+, Co2+, or Zn2+ by 14%, 23%, 28%, and 11%, respectively. The Km and Vmax values of the purified enzyme were calculated to be 0.401 µM and 14.65 μmol min-1, respectively. The soymilk yogurt showed an increase in its total phenolic content and total flavonoids after enzyme treatment, as well as several volatile compounds that were detected and identified using GC-MS analysis. HPLC analysis clarified the enzymatic action in the hydrolysis of raffinose family oligosaccharides. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate the importance of A. niger NRC114 α-galactosidase enzyme for future studies, especially its applications in a variety of biological fields.",

      "abstract": "A high-fat diet (HFD) easily contributes to the pathogenesis of obesity and insulin resistance. Obesity and insulin resistance have been clinical and public health challenges all over the world. Probiotic-fermented yogurt is one type of popular and functional beverage in people's daily lives. This study mainly explored the lipid- and glucose-lowering effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus NX2-6-fermented yogurt (LA-Y) in HFD-fed mice. The results showed that LA-Y administration improved the lipid profile in the serum and liver, reduced fasting blood glucose levels, and enhanced insulin sensitivity. Protein analysis showed that LA-Y treatment promoted fatty acid oxidation and suppressed de novo lipogenesis in the adipose tissue and liver. LA-Y effectively alleviated glucose metabolism disorders by activating the insulin signaling pathway, suppressing gluconeogenesis in the liver and muscle, reducing the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum, and promoting glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in the small intestine. LA-Y supplementation also promoted fat browning via the adiponectin/AMPKα/PGC-1α/UCP1 pathway and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis in the liver and muscle by activating the adiponectin/AdipoR1/APPL1/AMPKα/PGC-1α pathway, leading to increased energy expenditure. Therefore, LA-Y may be a functional dairy food for preventing and alleviating diet-induced metabolic disorders.",

Influenza and COVID-19 are typical infectious respiratory diseases, and they sometimes lead to various complications. In a situation in which no established drug or treatment exists, consumption of proper food might be beneficial in maintaining health against external infections. We studied the potential effects of mixtures of probiotic strains on various viral infections. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of yogurt containing probiotics to reduce the risk of respiratory viruses such as influenza H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, we performed in vitro tests using infected Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and Vero E6 cells, to evaluate the potential effects of yogurt containing high-dose probiotics against influenza H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The yogurt significantly reduced plaque formation in the virus-infected cells. We also performed in vivo tests using influenza H1N1-infected C57BL/6 mice and SARS-CoV-2-infected Syrian golden hamsters, to evaluate the potential effects of yogurt. Yogurt was administered orally once daily during the experimental period. Yogurt was also administered orally as pretreatment once daily for 3 wk before viral infection. Regarding influenza H1N1, it was found that yogurt caused an increase in the survival rate, body weight, and IFN-γ, IgG1, and IL-10 levels against viral infection and a decrease in the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. Although the SARS-CoV-2 copy number was not significantly reduced in the lungs of yogurt-treated SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, the body weights and histopathological findings of the lungs were improved in the yogurt-treated group. In conclusion, we suggest that consumption of yogurt containing probiotics can lead to beneficial effects to prevent respiratory viral infections.",

The results showed that Lpb. plantarum LPP703 significantly inhibited four fungal species, including Penicillium sp., Rhizopus delemar, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus niger. The metabolites produced after 20 h of Lpb. plantarum LPP703 fermentation showed the highest antifungal activity against Penicillium sp. Compared with the control group, the Lpb. plantarum LPP703 metabolites-treated Penicillium sp. spores were stained red by propidium iodide, indicating that the cell membrane of the fungal spores was damaged. Moreover, the antifungal effect of the Lpb. plantarum LPP703 metabolites on Penicillium sp. was not changed after heating or treatment with various proteases, but showed a sharp decrease when the pH value was regulated to 5.0 or above. The oleamide, trans-cinnamic acid, and citric acid were the three most abundant in the Lpb. plantarum LPP703 metabolites. Molecular docking predicated that the oleamide interacted with the active site of lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase (CYP51, a crucial enzyme for fungal membrane integrity) through hydrogen bonds and had the lowest docking score, representing the strongest binding affinity to CYP51. Taken together, the metabolites from a new strain of Lpb. plantarum, LPP703, had potent antifungal activity against Penicillium sp., which might be associated with the damage of the active ingredient to fungal membrane integrity. This study indicated that Lpb. plantarum LPP703 and its metabolites might act as biological control agents to prevent fungal growth in the food industry."

      "abstract": "Greek strained yogurt is produced in high quantities worldwide. This production leaves behind acid whey, a by-product that is an environmental challenge. Hence, efforts are made to minimize the acid whey generation. In this study, the combined effect of the different heat treatment levels of milk and the different time of straining on the composition of the produced strained yogurt, as well as on the quantity and composition of the expelled acid whey, was investigated. The initial yogurts were prepared with bovine milk heated at 85 °C/16 s or 100 °C/16 s or 90 °C/5 min, and the acid whey was removed by centrifugation (5500 rpm, 5 min, 25 °C) either immediately after incubation or after 24 h. The results showed that, regardless of the heat treatment of milk, straining after 24 h resulted in an 8% increase in the yield in strained yogurt and about an 11% decrease in the generated acid whey, compared to straining immediately after incubation. The heat treatment level of milk significantly influenced the fat, lactose, and total solids contents of the strained yogurts, as well as the residual whey proteins, protein, and total solids contents of acid whey. Yogurt's sensory properties were not affected significantly. It was concluded that the quantity of the acid whey expelled during the production of Greek strained yogurt could be decreased without affecting the general quality of the yogurt."

In this study, riboflavin-enriched yogurt-based fermented milk was prepared by mixing 1% (v/v) riboflavin-producing strain [1.2 × 108 CFU/mL of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum MTCC 25432 or L. plantarum MTCC 25433 or L. plantarum MTCC 25434] with 2% (v/v) traditional yogurt cultures [Streptococcus thermophilus NCDC 295 and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus NCDC 293; each of 1.3 × 107 CFU/mL]. The yogurt-based fermented milk prepared with traditional yogurt cultures (2%, v/v) was served as a control. The prepared yogurt-based fermented milk samples were analyzed and compared for riboflavin content, antimicrobial activity, physicochemical, and functional properties. As a result, the yogurt-based fermented milk prepared with L. plantarum MTCC 25432 produced a significantly higher amount of riboflavin (2.49 mg/L) as compared with MTCC 25433 (2.33 mg/L), MTCC 25434 (2.14 mg/L), and control (1.70 mg/L). The probiotic supplementation to yogurt cultures maintained the pH and titratable acidity in the range of 4.1-4.4 and 1.0-1.05% (lactic acid/100 mL), as recommended by Indian yogurt standards. The rheological, texture, and antimicrobial properties of yogurt-based fermented milk were enhanced with the addition of riboflavin-producing probiotic strains. Moreover, all yogurt-based fermented milk samples prepared in this study were acceptable as per the sensory evolution scores. In conclusion, the use of riboflavin-producing L. plantarum strains along with standard yogurt cultures could be the best approach to enhancing riboflavin content in yogurt-based fermented milk and fulfilling the daily riboflavin requirement in humans.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Calcium is an essential dietary mineral nutrient for humans. Digestive instability limits the bioavailability of calcium ions. Peptide-calcium chelate has been proven to excite higher calcium absorption than amino acid-calcium chelate, organic and inorganic calcium. Soy yogurt, which is produced via liquid-state fermentation using lactic acid bacteria, has a high amount of bioavailable calcium. In this study, a novel peptide with high calcium binding affinity was purified and identified from soy yogurt. The binding mechanism of peptide and calcium was then analyzed by bioinformatics and spectral analysis. Furthermore, the effect of the novel peptide on gastrointestinal stability by the Caco-2 cell model and calcium bioavailability in vivo were investigated by the zebrafish model. RESULTS: The results showed that a novel peptide was purified and identified as DEDEQIPSHPPR (CBP). Calcium ions probably coordinate with Glu-2 and Glu-4 carboxyl groups via salt bridges and interact with Asp-1, Asp-3, and Arg-12 in CBP via charge pairing. The calcium binding activity of the CBP was 36.64 ± 0.04 mg g-1 . Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra showed that calcium spontaneously bound to the amino group nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the carboxyl group. The binding mode is either bidentate or unidentate, depending on the circumstances. More importantly, the CBP peptide substantially increased the bone mass in a zebrafish osteoporosis model. CONCLUSION: The more glutamic acid and aspartic acid, the high was the calcium affinity with peptide. Soy yogurt-derived peptides can be used as carriers of calcium ions throughout the gastrointestinal tract, which may be clinically useful for osteoporosis therapy. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Antidiabetic drugs are common treatments for this metabolic disorder; however, they may have unpleasant side effects. This study hypothesized that probiotic fermented products could preserve nutritional value, maintain metabolic homeostasis, and attenuate the inflammatory response associated with diabetes while reducing side effects. Lactobacillus plantarum KU985438 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus KU985439 showed the lowest alfa-amylase enzyme (α-amylase) activity among 8 lactobacilli tested. These 2 strains were used to develop functional fermented milk products, and their antidiabetic efficacy was tested in induced diabetic Wistar rats. The treatment of diabetic rats with L. plantarum KU985438 or L. rhamnosus KU985439 fermented yogurt resulted in a considerable reduction in blood glucose concentrations (136.79% and 145.17%, respectively) and α-amylase concentrations (56.84% and 56.84%, respectively) compared with conventional treatments. Diabetes relief began after 4 days of yogurt consumption compared with drug-based treatment. Significant improvements in both liver and kidney enzyme concentrations were also observed, in addition to a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and improved lipid profiles. Inhibition in nuclear factor κB and an increase in Bcl-2 concentrations were also detected. Histopathological examination of both hepatic and pancreatic cells revealed the positive effects of the studied treatment compared with standard treatment. Therefore, the selected Lactobacilli, which has hypoglycemic potential, could be used to produce functional nutraceutical antidiabetic supplements.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Functional constipation is a gastrointestinal disorder that affects millions of people and is correlated with gut microbiome dysbiosis. The currently available treatments are ineffective; therefore, novel treatment schemes targeting the gut microbiome are desired. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of yogurt supplemented with seven probiotic strains and six types of dietary fibers on functional constipation. METHODS: In the mouse study, mice with induced constipation were administered the yogurt once a day for 1 wk, with fecal parameters and intestinal transit rate measured. In the clinical study, participants with constipation (N = 86) were given the yogurt once daily (200 g) for 4 wk. Fecal and blood samples along with Patient Assessment of Constipation-symptoms and Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life Scale questionnaires were collected to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the yogurt. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed to analyze fecal samples of both mice and humans. RESULTS: We found that constipated mice had different gut microbiomes compared with those in healthy controls; yogurt treatment significantly relieved constipation-related symptoms and resulted in shifts in the microbiome. Yogurt also relieved symptoms of antibiotic-induced constipation in mice and restored the gut microbiome to a certain extent. In the clinical trial with 86 patients, yogurt administration significantly improved constipation symptoms and showed no serious adverse effects (was generally considered safe). However, subsequent metagenomic profiling of the gut microbiome did not reveal significant changes in the microbial composition, in contrast to the results in mice. We hypothesize that the differences in dosage between mice and humans may attribute to such discrepancies, and microbiome changes may not be necessary for improvements of constipation symptoms in humans. CONCLUSION: Results from this study showed that yogurt can potentially be used for the treatment of constipation.",

This study aims to investigate the effect of milk calcium-enriched milk, yogurt, and yogurt-inulin combination on the gut-bone association. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 6-week intervention study is conducted in ovariectomized rats. Four pastes containing milk calcium-fortified milk (M-Ca), milk calcium-fortified yogurt (Y-Ca), inulin-fortified Y-Ca (Y-I-Ca), or an isoconcentration of calcium carbonate (Ca-N), and a calcium-deficient paste are provided. M-Ca does not influence bone mineral density and content (BMD and BMC), femur mechanical strength, or femoral microstructure compared to Ca-N, but Y-Ca increases spine BMD. The serum metabolome reveals that Y-Ca modulated glycine-related pathways with reduced glycine, serine, and threonine. No additive effects of yogurt and inulin are found on bone parameters. Correlation analysis shows that increased lactobacilli and reduced Clostridiaceae members in Y-Ca is associated with an increased spine BMD. Increases in Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Turicibacter, Blautia, and Allobaculum and gut short-chain fatty acids in Y-I-Ca are not reflected in bone parameters. CONCLUSION: Yogurt as calcium vehicle contributes to increased spine BMD concomitant with changes in the gut microbiome and glycine-related pathways, while adding inulin to yogurt does not affect bone mineralization in ovariectomized rats.",

      "abstract": "Water soluble coconut extract (WSCE) was reported as a suitable matrix for probiotic delivery as yogurt alternatives. The study aimed to evaluate the roles of brewers' spent grain (BSG) derivatives in enhancing the properties of WSCE-based yogurt alternatives. BSG flour (BSGF) and 3 different protein extracts (BSGPs) including protein control (BSGP-C), protamex treatment (BSGP-P), and protamex combined with flavourzyme treatment (BSGP-PF) were incorporated in WSCE-based yogurt alternatives. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that BSGPs prepared with protease treatment generated less dense fat distribution and more homogenous globules compared to that in WSCE control yogurt. It also resulted in a softer, denser and more homogenous matrix. The modification in microstructural properties was aligned with differences in several functional groups including ⍺-glycosidic bond and hydroxyl groups from polysaccharides, aliphatic ethers and acid functional groups as well as aromatic hydrocarbons of lignin, amide I, acetyl groups and amide III. BSGF and BSGPs increased the mechanical properties, viscosity and modified flow behaviour properties demonstrating its ability in maintaining textural and gel formation. After 14 days of storage, maintenance in flow behaviour, syneresis and mechanical properties was identified. Furthermore, BSG derivatives enhanced lactic acid production up to 3 folds. In conclusion, BSG derivatives maintained the microstructure and gel formation, improved the properties of WSCE-based yogurt alternatives and preserved its behaviour during 14 days of storage."

Materials and Methods: This randomized clinical trial evaluated 120 eligible dental students that were randomly divided into four groups (n=30) for use of (I) CPP-ACP chewing gum, (II) xylitol chewing gum, (III) probiotic yogurt, and (IV) chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash. The oral hygiene index-simplified (OHI-S), Silness and Loe gingival index (GI), and Silness and Loe modified plaque index (PI) were measured before and on days 15 and 30 after using the products. Paired t-test or its non-parametric equivalent was used to analyze the parameters after the intervention compared with baseline. The study groups were compared using one-way ANOVA or its non-parametric equivalent. Results: The OHI-S did not change over time, and most participants had a good OHI-S. The CHX group had the most favorable, and the probiotic yogurt group had the least favorable GI. Pairwise comparisons of the groups did not reveal a significant difference in GI between the CPP-ACP gum and CHX groups (P>0.05). CHX caused the greatest improvement in PI, with significant differences with other groups. Conclusion: CHX was the most effective for improvement of periodontal parameters followed by CPP-ACP, which showed better results compared with other groups."

The results indicated that coagulation time increased by 22.75% in yogurts prepared with Lactobacillus acidophilus and their bacteriocins compared to the control, and titratable acidity increased gradually in all treatments during storage. Hence control acidity (%) increased from 0.84 ± 0.02A at zero time to 1.23 ± 0.03A after 14 days of cold storage, while treatment (T4) was 0.72 ± 0.01C at zero time and reached 1.20 ± 0.5A after 39 days at the same conditions. The sensory properties showed the superiority of inulin, FOS, and Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteriocin groups. Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophiles, and Lactobacillus acidophilus count increased in the treatments compared to the control group, with an extended shelf life to 39 days of storage in the medicines containing lactobacillus acidophilus bacteriocin.

      "abstract": "Cholesterol is essential for normal human health, but elevations in its serum levels have led to the development of various complications, including hypercholesterolemia (HC). Cholesterol accumulation in blood circulation formsplaques on artery walls and worsens the individuals' health. To overcome this complication, different pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches are employed to reduce elevated blood cholesterol levels. Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are the most commonly used drugs, but their prolonged use leads to several acute side effects. In recent decades, the potential benefit of ingesting yogurt on lipid profile has attracted the interest of researchers and medical professionals worldwide. This review aims to give an overview of the current knowledge about HC and the different therapeutic approaches. It also discusses the health benefits of yogurt consumption and highlights the overlooked phyto-enrichment option to enhance the yogurt's quality. Finally, clinical studies using different phyto-enriched yogurts for HC management are also reviewed. Yogurt has a rich nutritional value, but its processing degrades the content of minerals, vitamins, and other vital constituents with beneficial health effects. The option of enriching yogurt with phytoconstituents has drawn a lot of attention. Different pre-clinical and clinical studies have provided new insights on their benefits on gut microbiota and human health. Thus, the yogurtphyto-enrichment with stanol and β-glucan have opened new paths in functional food industries and found healthy andeffective alternatives for HC all along with conventional treatment approaches.",

      "abstract": "The human blood sugar level is important and should be controlled to avoid any damage to nerves and blood vessels which could lead to heart disease and many other problems. Several market-available treatments for diabetes could be used, such as insulin therapy, synthetic drugs, herbal drugs, and transdermal patches, to help control blood sugar. In a double-blind human study, four kinds of honey from bees fed on acacia, sea buckthorn, chlorella alga, and green walnut extracts were used in fortifying yogurt for controlling human blood sugar. The impact of a previously fortified honey was investigated on blood levels and other parameters of healthy individuals in a human study with 60 participants. The participants received 150 mL of yogurt mixed with 30 g of honey every morning for 21 days. Before and after the study period, the basic blood parameters were tested, and the participants filled out standardized self-report questionnaires. Acacia honey was the traditional honey used as a control; the special honey products were produced by the patented technology. The consumption of green walnut honey had a significant effect on the morning blood sugar level, which decreased for every participant in the group (15 people). The average blood sugar level at the beginning in the walnut group was 4.81 mmol L-1, whereas the value after 21 days was 3.73 mmol L-1. The total decrease level of the individuals was about 22.45% (1.08 mmol L-1). Concerning the sea buckthorn and chlorella alga-based honey product groups, there was no significant change in the blood sugar level, which were recorded at 4.91 and 5.28 mmol L-1 before treatment and 5.28 and 5.07 mmol L-1 after, respectively. In the case of the acacia honey group, there was a slight significant decrease as well, it was 4.77 mmol L-1 at the beginning and 4.27 mmol L-1 at the end with a total decrease rate of 10.48%. It could thus be concluded that the active ingredients of green walnut can significantly decrease the blood sugar level in humans. This study, as a first report, is not only a new innovative process to add herbs or healthy active ingredients to honey but also shows how these beneficial ingredients aid the honey in controlling the human blood sugar level."

This study investigated the effects of enzymatic-induced hydrolysis on two types of guava purée by-products, particularly the prebiotic activity after its inclusion in yogurt-making. Commercial cellulase and xylanase were applied together or separately on refiner (the seed-rich fraction), and decanter (the pulp-rich fraction); labelled as 150 XY (xylanase); 150 CE (cellulase), 150 CX (combined cellulase-xylanase), and CT (control, untreated). The hydrolysis extents followed the order of 150 XY < 150 CE < 150CX. The ethanolic extracts (EEC) of the treated samples were analyzed on selected sugar content and the prebiotic activity score. Rhamnose and xylose were the main sugar constituents in both refiner and decanter. A two to four-fold increments of prebiotic activity score were observed on EEC of combined cellulase and xylanase treated decanter and refiner. Incorporating the combined enzymatically treated whole guava by-products into UHT fresh milk containing a yogurt starter culture significantly increased the log CFU/mL up to 77.6%, enhanced hardness, stickiness, and adhesiveness ranging from 22.2 to 86.4%, and decreased pH values. Combined cellulase-xylanase treatment can convert guava purée by-products into potential prebiotic sources for food applications.",

RESULTS: Appropriate ultrasound pretreatment significantly enhanced the growth of L. plantarum. The degradation percentages of pesticides increased by 19-38% under ultrasound treatment. Ultrasonic intensity, pulse duty cycle, and duration time were key factors affecting microbial growth and pesticide degradation. Under optimal ultrasonic pre-treatment conditions, the degradation rate constants of four pesticides were at least 3.4 times higher than those without sonication. In addition, such ultrasound pretreatment significantly shortened yogurt fermentation time, increased the water holding capacity, hardness and antioxidant activity of the yogurt, and improved the flavor quality of the yogurt. CONCLUSION: Ultrasonic pretreatment significantly accelerated the degradation of the four pesticides during yogurt fermentation. In addition, such ultrasound pretreatment increased the efficiency of yogurt making and improved the quality of yogurt in terms of water holding capacity, firmness, antioxidant activity, and flavor. These findings provide a basis for the application of ultrasound to the removal of pesticide residues and quality improvement of yogurt. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.",

METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted at department of Paediatrics, Children Hospital, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad over 1 year. A total of nine hundred and thirty (930) children between 1-5 years of age presenting with acute diarrhoea were enrolled and equally randomized to Group-A (yogurt) and Group-B (lactobacillus rhamnosus) with ORS. The primary outcome was mean frequency of diarrhoea in first 24 hours after initiation of treatment in both the groups. RESULTS: Gender distribution revealed that out of 930 patients, 643 (69.1%) were male and 287 (30.9%) were female while the mean age was 3.14±1.18 years. Mean duration of disease was 4.23±2.02 days. Mean no. of stools in first 24 hours after treatment in Group-A (yogurt) was 3.25±1.64 and 3.29±1.74 in Group-B (probiotics).

We aimed to determine the effect of brown yogurt (SSN) on the composition of the gut microbiota and to explore the effects of the major components. We performed a randomized study of 70 healthy adults to compare the effects of SSN and standard probiotic-containing yogurt (YJD) during a 28-day intervention and a 10-day follow-up period. The results showed that the SSN group showed significant increases in the butyrate-producer Akkermansia muciniphila, Ruminococcus, and Veillonella (p < 0.05), whereas the YJD group showed increases in the butyrate-producer Megasphaera, Anaerostipes, and Eubacterium. There were reductions in the potential pathogens Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Gemmiger formicilis in both groups (p < 0.05). The SSN group had more Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Prevotella copri, Bifidobacterium and B. longum than the YJD group (p < 0.001), but fewer Bacteroides, unspecified Clostridiales and Coprococcus eutactus (p < 0.01). These differences might be at least in part explained by the higher concentrations of monosaccharide, palmitoleic acid, and glutamine synthetase adenyltransferase in the SSN product (p < 0.05), which were positively associated with F. prausnitzii (p ≤ 0.001) and B. longum (p < 0.05), and negatively associated with C. eutactus (p < 0.01). The single strain of starter culture and lower content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the SSN product were also related to the different changes of gut microbia, and the taxa F. prausnitzii, Bifidobacterium and B. longum were negatively associated with starter culture and PUFA (p < 0.01). These findings suggested that SSN is rich in prebiotic components and might be beneficial for healthy adults. Furthermore, bacterial taxa with potential health benefits could be encouraged through improving the formulation and technology used to produce the dairy products.",

It sought to observe the physicochemical and sensory qualities during storage (4°C). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Goat milk was obtained from local farmers in Lubuk Minturun, Padang, West Sumatra, Indonesia. The yogurt was divided into two factors. Factor A was supplemented with red ginger in various concentrations: A (0% - as control), B (1%), C (2%), and D (3%). On the other hand, Factor B was subjected to variations in storage time: A (1 day), B (15 days), and C (30 days). Each treatment was conducted in triplicate. Physicochemical properties (pH, titratable acidity [TTA], and proximate analysis), sensory characteristics, and antioxidant activity (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging capacity) were measured using the standard tests. The data were analyzed through analyzing multivariate (analysis of variance) supported by Duncan's multiple range test. RESULTS: The addition of red ginger juice increased the antioxidant activity, TTA, and water holding capacity (WHC) (p<0.05), while syneresis was significantly decreased; however, it had no effect on the total lactic acid bacteria. At the end of this research (day 30), the yogurt was still suitable for consumption, with the following composition: Antioxidant activity 48.39%, pH 4.3, TTA 1.716, water content 80%, protein 3%, fat 3%, syneresis 28%, WHC 63%, and total lactic acid bacteria 89×108 colony-forming units/mL. Furthermore, yogurt supplemented with red ginger changed its color into red blush. CONCLUSION: Yogurt red ginger juice is recommended as a functional drink, as it contains probiotics P. acidilactici BK01 and antioxidants to support human health. The addition of up to 3% ginger juice and a storage period of 30 days are still favored by the panelists and meet the quality standard of yogurt. We have not conducted the study on active compounds so, further research could be conducted on the components of the active compounds found in red ginger yogurt."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To date, no study has investigated the effects of probiotic yogurt as a functional food in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the impact of probiotic yogurt versus ordinary yogurt on inflammatory, endothelial, lipid and renal indices in CHF patients. In this randomized, triple-blind clinical trial, 90 patients with CHF were randomly allocated into two groups to take either probiotic or ordinary yogurt for 10 weeks. Serum levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK), soluble cluster of differentiation 163 (sCD163), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) were measured by using ELISA kits, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was measured by calorimetry method at baseline and at the end of trial. The P-value <0.05 was defined as statistically significant. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients completed the study. At the end of the intervention, the levels of sTWEAK in both groups increased significantly, and this increase was greater in the probiotic yogurt group [691.84 (335.60, 866.95)] compared to control group [581.96 (444.99, 929.40)], and the difference between the groups was statistically significant after adjusting for confounders (P-value: 0.257, adjusted P-value: 0.038). However, no significant differences were found between the groups in the cases of other study indices. CONCLUSION: Probiotic yogurt may be useful for improving the inflammatory status in patients with CHF through increasing sTWEAK levels, however, further studies are needed in this area. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Consumers suffering from lactose intolerance and metabolic syndrome are looking for sugar-free products. The current study investigates the sugar replacements by using sweeteners (stevia, sucralose and sorbitol) on physicochemical, microbiological, microstructural and sensory characteristics of probiotic-frozen yogurt. Four different treatments of probiotic-frozen yogurts were studied (control probiotic-frozen yogurt with sucrose (F1), probiotic-frozen yogurt with stevia (F2), probiotic-frozen yogurt with sucralose (F3) and probiotic-frozen yogurt with sorbitol (F4)). The chemical properties were not significantly present p > 0.05) during storage in all treatments. In the F1 treatment, sucrose value was higher (14.87%) and not detected in the F2, F3 and F4 treatments. The highest values of overrun, hardness and viscosity (p < 0.05) were detected in the F2, F3 and F3 samples, but the lowest value was detected in the F1 treatment. Total Str. thermophilus and Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus counts were gradually decreased (p < 0.05) during storage periods. At 1 day, the Bifidobacteria counts ranged from 7.56 to 7.60 log10 CFU g−1 in all groups and gradually decreased during storage, but these bacterial counts remained viable (>6.00 log10 CFU g−1) during storage periods up to 60 d. During storage periods, the highest scores of total acceptability were detected in the F3, F4 and F2 treatments. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of all probiotic-frozen yogurt treatments illustrated that the microstructures showed a difference with a fine network, size pores and structure between the frozen yogurt with sweeteners (F2, F3 and F3) and control frozen yogurt (F1)."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Foods containing both prebiotics and probiotics (synbiotics) might enhance calcium bioavailability. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the acute effect in young adult women on calcium absorption of consuming (185 mL) a synbiotic yogurt (SYN) containing inulin (4 g) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (>1 × 107 CFU/mL) compared with a control yogurt (CON). METHODS: Adult normal-weight women (25.0 ± 3.5 y, n = 30) participated in a 3-wk crossover study testing daily consumption of SYN compared with CON. Habitual dietary intake, bone mineral density (BMD), calcium biomarkers, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D were measured at baseline. Calcium absorption was tested after each phase of the study using a 42Ca oral tracer. Cumulative tracer recovery was measured in 0-4-h,  0-24-h, and 0-36-h urine pools collected postdosing. The SYN/CON tracer ratio from the timed urine pools was the primary outcome. A beneficial response to SYN was defined as 0-36-h SYN/CON tracer ratio >1. RESULTS: Net 42Ca recovered increased over time in each of the SYN and CON urine pools postdosing (Friedman, P < 0.001), with a trend for higher 42Ca recovery in the 0-36-h urine pool postdosing in the SYN (1.14%) compared with the CON (0.90%) study (Wilcoxon, P = 0.07). For CON, the majority of total tracer was recovered in the 0-24-h pool (86%), whereas for SYN only 50% of total tracer was recovered in the 0-24-h pool (Friedman, P = 0.001). The SYN/CON tracer ratio in the 0-36-h pool (1.24) was >1 (Wilcoxon, P = 0.015). About two-thirds (n = 19) of women studied responded to the SYN treatment. Responders had higher vegetable intake (P = 0.03), tended to have higher potassium and calcium intakes (P ≤ 0.08), and had higher total body BMD (P = 0.09), than nonresponders. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term daily consumption of a synbiotic yogurt enhanced calcium absorption relative to a control yogurt in adult women. Given the observed time delays in tracer recovery, enhancement of calcium absorption likely occurred in the large intestine.The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (study registration ID: NCT03420716).",

Several clinical trials have shown that probiotics can prevent AAD. This study aimed at investigating the effects of Lacidophilin tablets (LB), yogurt (YG), and bifid triple viable capsules (BT) on the gut microbiota of mice with AAD. Mice with diarrhea were randomly allocated to treatment groups or the control group and were treated with either LB, YG, BT, or vehicle control. The body weight, diarrhea scores, cecum index, and cecal length were determined. Fecal samples of all mice were analyzed using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that LB, YG, and BT significantly decreased the diarrhea scores and inhibited increases in the cecum index and cecal length induced by AAD. In addition, they significantly changed the composition and richness of the gut microbiota. Specifically, they increased the abundance of the phylum Firmicutes and decreased the abundance of the phyla Bacteroidetes and the family Bacteroidaceae. Treatment with LB and YG also decreased the abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria and only LB could mediate the reduced levels of Lactobacillaceae in AAD mice. At the genus level, YG and BT treatment decreased the abundance of Bacteroides or Parasutterella. To our surprise, only LB treatment dramatically increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and decreased that of potential pathogens, such as Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Parasutterella, to almost normal values. Our findings indicate that LB, YG, and BT ameliorated diarrhea by regulating the composition and structure of the gut microbiota and that LB plays an important role in regulating the gut microbiota."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Given the increasing prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, it is necessary to find an easy and cost-effective method in its management and treatment. Probiotics are a group of living microorganisms that might affect NAFLD through the intestinal-liver axis. The present clinical trial aims to examine the effect of probiotic yogurt consumption on liver enzymes, steatosis and liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with NAFLD will be recruited in this study. After block matching for sex, BMI and age, patients will be randomly assigned to receive 300 g/d probiotic yogurt containing 106 cfu/g of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis strains or 300 g/d plain yogurt daily for 12 weeks and those in the control group would receive similar amounts of plain yogurts. Weight, height, and waist circumference will be measured at study baseline and after the intervention. Biochemical indicators including plasma glucose, serum insulin, lipid profile, liver markers (ALT, AST and GGT) will be examined at study baseline and at the end of the trial. Insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity will be determined using the HOMA-IR and QUICKI equation. The degree of steatosis and hepatic fibrosis will also be assessed at the beginning and end of the intervention by the same gastroenterologist using elastography with fibroscan. DISCUSSION: Probiotics have been suggested as a new strategy in the management of NAFLD. Their effects might be mediated through intestinal microbiota modification and production of short-chain fatty acids. Consumption of probiotic-enriched foods, rather than their supplements, might be a cost-effective method for long-term use in these patients. In case of finding the beneficial effects of probiotic yogurt consumption in the current clinical trial, its inclusion in the dietary plan of NAFLD patients can be recommended.

Vit D deficiency is also associated with increased systemic inflammation. The current study aimed to determine the efficacy of low-fat milk and yogurt fortified with 1500 IU nano-encapsulated vitamin D, on systemic inflammation in abdominal obese participants. METHOD: This multi-center study was conducted using a 2.5-month parallel total-blind randomized clinical trial design. Two hundred and eighty nine subjects were allocated to four groups: low-fat milk fortified by 1500 IU nano-encapsulated vitamin D3 (200 mL/day). Simple milk (200 mL/day), low-fat yogurt fortified by 1500 IU nano-encapsulated vitamin D3 (150 g/day), and simple yogurt (150 g/day). RESULTS: The results showed that serum levels of neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets and red blood cell distribution width (RDW) were significantly lower before and after the intervention in fortified dairy groups. The results showed that serum levels of neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets, and RDW before and after intervention in the fortified dairy groups were significantly lower (p < 0.05). The values of = neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelets to lymphocyte ratio, and RDW to platelets ratio (RPR) reduced significantly in the fortification group (p < 0.05).

      "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus and its biofilm have emerged as a significant threat to the safety of dairy products. In recent years, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) bacteriocins have been widely acknowledged as the potential natural antibacterial substance in food biopreservation due to their excellent antibacterial effects. However, few LAB bacteriocins with antibacterial and antibiofilm activity against S. aureus have been reported in dairy products. In the present study, a novel bacteriocin LSX01 of Lactobacillus paracasei LS-6 isolated from a traditional fermented yogurt produced in Yunnan, China, was purified and characterized extensively. The LSX01 possessed a molecular weight of 967.49 Da and an AA sequence of LDQAGISYT. The minimum inhibitory concentration of LSX01 against S. aureus_45 was 16.90 μg/mL, which was close to or lower than the previously reported bacteriocins. The LSX01 exhibited an extensive antimicrobial spectrum against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, LSX01 exhibited excellent tolerance to heat and acid-base treatments, and sensitivity to the proteolytic enzymes, such as pepsin and proteinase K. Furthermore, the treatment of S. aureus_45 planktonic cells with LSX01 significantly reduced their metabolic activity and disrupted the cell membrane integrity. Scan electron microscopy results demonstrated that LSX01 induced cytoplasmic content leakage and cell deformation. Additionally, biofilm formation of S. aureus_45 was also significantly inhibited by LSX01. Overall, the results suggested that the novel LAB bacteriocin LSX01 possessed antibacterial activity and antibiofilm activity against S. aureus and, hence, could have potential for improving safety of dairy products.",

We investigated the effects of homogenization conducted at higher pressure than the conventional conditions (10 MPa for the first stage and 5 MPa for the second stage) on the curd structure of set yogurt, with a focus on the fat globule size. Each yogurt mix was adjusted at the range of fat globule sizes from 0.45 μm to 1.1 μm by a homogenizer and then heated at 95°C for 5 min (conventional heat treatment), 120°C for 2 s, ESL processing, or 140°C for 2 s. The yogurt mixes were fermented by a common yogurt starter, and the curd texture of the obtained yogurts was evaluated. We observed that the curd hardness and curd firmness of the yogurt were each negatively correlated with the fat globule size regardless of the heat-treatment temperature. Compared with the curd obtained with conventional heat treatment, the ESL-processed curd was extremely fragile, but significantly smooth. With ESL processing, a curd hardness >40 g, which is a sufficient strength for commercial transport systems, was obtained by making the fat particle size <0.6 µm, using 2-stage homogenization pressure: 35 MPa for the first stage and 5 MPa for the second stage. A microscopy analysis indicated that the smaller fat globules reinforce the network structure. The yogurt made by ESL processing and that created with 35 + 5 MPa homogenization had significant sensory evaluation scores. Our results indicate that the combination of ESL processing and 35 + 5 MPa homogenization is a novel and useful method for manufacturing set yogurt.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of probiotic bacteria in yogurt on Streptococcus mutans (MS) count, plaque adherence and salivary pH compared to xylitol-containing chewing gum in geriatric patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total number of 96 high caries risk geriatric patients were randomized into two equal groups (n=48). Group 1 (intervention group) received probiotic yogurt (Activia, Danone) once per day, and group 2 (control group) received xylitol chewing gum (Trident original) three times per day. The primary outcome was salivary Streptococcus mutans count and secondary outcomes were interdental plaque Streptococcus mutans count, salivary pH and bacterial adherence. RESULTS: For Streptococcus mutans count in saliva and plaque, a statistically significant reduction in the level of MS over all the examined follow up periods of the study in probiotic yogurt group as well as xylitol gum group was found. An intergroup comparison for salivary MS count showed statistically significant difference between the two materials in a two week and a three month period of time and there was no statistically significant difference between both materials at one month time period. Salivary pH results showed statistically significant increase in pH in both groups along the follow-up periods. Bacterial adherence results showed statistically significant reduction in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic yogurt is an effective antibacterial agent against salivary and plaque bacteria in geriatric patients."

      "abstract": "Diabetes, one of the most serious and common chronic metabolic diseases affecting people worldwide in the 21st century, has become a major problem that needs to be addressed urgently. This study was designed to elucidate the anti-diabetic effect of yak yogurt-derived Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum SHY130 on C57BL/6J mice fed high-fat diet and streptozotocin (HFD/STZ), and the potential regulatory mechanisms involved. Mice were divided into 3 groups: normal control, diabetes, and diabetes treated with L. plantarum SHY130 (SHY130). Treatment with L. plantarum SHY130 had a regulatory effect on blood glucose and clearly ameliorated insulin resistance in T2DM mice. L. plantarum SHY130 inhibited the reduction in β-cell mass and α-cell proliferation in the pancreas and increased the expression of the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) receptors GPR43 and GPR41 in the colon of T2DM mice. Furthermore, L. plantarum SHY130 treatment readjusted intestinal flora structure, enhanced the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibaculum, Odoribacter, Alistipes, and increased the levels of SCFAs in diabetic mice. In summary, L. plantarum SHY130 ameliorated hyperglycemia in HFD/STZ-induced diabetic mice by regulating the enteroinsular axis.",

      "abstract": "Hunger-reducing effects and beneficial changes in gastrointestinal hormones have been reported, in overweight/obese individuals consuming dairy while yogurt takes pride of place due to its unique structure and composition. Although the contribution of yogurt to metabolic regulation has received growing attention, the research studies which examine its role on appetite are limited, especially regarding type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of non-fat, conventional yogurt consumption on appetite hormone responses of T2DM patients following a non-energy-restricted diet. Overweight subjects participated in a 12-week dietary intervention including 2 meals/day (2 × 200 g) of yogurt. At the beginning and the end of the intervention, a mixed meal tolerance test assessing the postprandial response of glucose, insulin, ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and peptide-YY (PYY) was performed. Subjective appetite ratings were also evaluated. Area under the curve for glucose, insulin, ghrelin, GLP-1, and PYY responses did not differ after the 12-week intervention with yogurt (p > .05) as well as for subjective appetite ratings (p > .05). No significant differences were indicated at specific time points in any of the examined parameters. Regular consumption of non-fat, conventional yogurt for 12-week duration does not affect appetite hormone responses in overweight patients with T2DM following a non-energy-restricted diet."
