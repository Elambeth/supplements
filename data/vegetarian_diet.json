      "abstract": "Metabolic Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD) is becoming a major global health concern due to its links with obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular risk. This randomized clinical trial assessed the effects of combining time-restricted feeding (TRF; 16/8) with a Lacto-Ovo-Vegetarian (LOV) diet on various factors in overweight and obese patients with MAFLD. Forty-six participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (TRF with LOV diet) or the control group, with 21 participants completing the 12-week study in each group. The intervention group showed significant reductions in weight (-8.07 ± 4.31 kg), BMI (-2.70 ± 1.32 kg/m2), waist circumference (-8.00 ± 4.06 cm), as well as ALT (-17.14 ± 14.33 U/L), GGT (-21.09 ± 24.06 U/L), Fatty Liver Index (-26.90 ± 15.81), insulin levels (-3.89 ± 4.69 mU/L), and TNF-α (-11.85 ± 12.52 pg/mL) compared to the control group (all P < 0.05). Lipid profiles also improved with a reduction in triglycerides (-46.85 ± 54.55 mg/dL) and an increase in HDL-C (3.91 ± 5.07 mg/dL) in the intervention group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). These findings imply that TRF combined with a LOV diet enhances metabolic markers, liver health, and weight loss, thus potentially offering a practical dietary approach for managing MAFLD. Further long-term studies are necessary to validate these results and investigate their clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lifestyle factors are being increasingly studied in bipolar disorder (BD) due to their possible effects on both course of disease and physical health. The aim of this study was to jointly describe and explore the interrelations between diet patterns, exercise, pharmacological treatment with course of disease and metabolic profile in BD. METHODS: The sample consisted of 66 euthymic or mild depressive individuals with BD. Clinical and metabolic outcomes were assessed, as well as pharmacological treatment or lifestyle habits (diet and exercise). Correlations were explored for different interrelations and a factor analysis of dietary patterns was performed. RESULTS: Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was low, seen in 37.9% of the patients and was positively associated with perceived quality of life. The amount of exercise was negatively associated with cholesterol levels, with 32.8% of participants rated as low active by International Physical Activity Questionnaire. There was a high prevalence of obesity (40.6%) and metabolic syndrome (29.7%). Users of lithium showed the best metabolic profile. Interestingly, three dietary patterns were identified: \"vegetarian,\" \"omnivore\" and \"Western.\" The key finding was the overall positive impact of the \"vegetarian\" pattern in BD, which was associated with reduced depression scores, better psychosocial functioning, and perceived quality of life, decreased body mass index, cholesterol, LDL and diastolic blood pressure. Nuts consumption was associated with a better metabolic profile. CONCLUSIONS: A vegetarian diet pattern was associated with both, better clinical and metabolic parameters, in patients with BD. Future studies should prioritize prospective and randomized designs to determine causal relationships, and potentially inform clinical recommendations.",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an adjunct role of oral potassium to reduce joint pain in RA. METHODS: 172 consenting eligible symptomatic patients (median duration 6.5 years) on standard care were randomised into an assessor blind, parallel efficacy, controlled, prospective, multiarm single-centre study (80% power, drug trial design) of 16 weeks duration-arm A (potassium-rich vegetarian diet), arm B (arm A plus novel potassium food supplement) and arm C (control, regular diet). Standard efficacy (American College of Rheumatology recommendation) and safety and diet intake (3-day recall) were assessed at monthly intervals (protocol). Standard soft-ware package (SPSS V.20) was used for statistical analysis; analysis of variance), Mann-Whitney statistic and χ2 test.; significant p<0.05, two sided). Study arms were found matched at baseline. Background RA medication remained stable. Preset target for increased potassium intake (India standards) were mostly achieved and participants remained normokalemic. RESULTS: 155 patients (90.1%) completed the study and several showed improvement (maximum improved measures in arm B). Potassium intervention was safe and well tolerated. Adverse events were mild; none caused patient withdrawal. On comparison, the mean change in pain visual analogue scale (-2.23, 95% CI -2.99 to -1.48) at week 16 (primary efficacy) from baseline was significantly superior in arm B (per protocol analysis). A high daily potassium intake (5-7.5 g, arm B) was significantly associated with low pain (study completion); OR 2.5 (univariate analysis), likelihood ratio 2.9 (logistic regression). Compliance (intervention), diet record and analysis, RA medication and absence of placebo were potential confounders. CONCLUSION: High oral potassium intake, based on a suitable vegetarian diet and food supplement, reduced joint pain and improved RA. It was a safe adjunct to standard care, Further validation studies are required. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CTRI/2022/03/040726; Clinical Trial Registry of India."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Osteosarcopenia adversely affects the quality of life and physical health of older adults. We sought to explore the association between dietary patterns and osteosarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study from Northeast China, in which, we included older community adults aged 60 and above. Through face-to-face interviews, we collected dietary information from participants using a food frequency questionnaire. Subsequently, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to obtain the dietary patterns of the participants. Through physical examination, we obtained the participants' information on osteosarcopenia, which was defined by the coexist of osteopenia and sarcopenia. We analysed the association between dietary patterns and dietary compositions with ostesarcopenia. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 9429 participants were included, and the prevalence of osteosarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults was 6.2%. PCA identified three main dietary patterns, and the lacto-ovo-vegetarian dietary pattern was inversely associated with osteosarcopenia. Compared to the lowest lacto-ovo-vegetarian quartile (Q1), the Q4 group (OR = 0.64, 95% CI:0.49-0.83) was inversely associated with osteosarcopenia. Through the weighted quantile sum regression model, we also found that the overall effect of the lacto-ovo-vegetarian dietary components was inversely associated with osteosarcopenia (OR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.37-0.92); the largest contributors were vegetables, fresh milk, eggs, and dairy products. CONCLUSION: Overall, we found that a lacto-ovo-vegetarian dietary pattern, particularly the consumption of vegetables, fresh milk, eggs, and dairy products, was inversely associated with osteosarcopenia in older adults. And this might provide new insights for the prevention and treatment of osteosarcopenia.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MASLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Given that there is no pharmacological treatment for MASLD, it is imperative to understand whether lifestyle modifications may improve biochemical and pathological outcomes. One commonly proposed dietary modification is the Mediterranean diet; however, vegetarianism may also be a promising intervention. Vegetarianism has been shown to be associated with reduced morbidity and mortality in metabolic syndrome outcomes in coronary artery disease and diabetes; however, the relationship between vegetarian diet and MASLD is less clear. In this scoping review, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the current body of evidence related to a vegetarian diet and MASLD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The aim of this scoping review is to describe and summarise the current body of evidence related to MASLD and a vegetarian diet. This review will be conducted using Arksey and O'Malley's framework. The literature review will be conducted using the following databases: SCOPUS, Web of Science, CINAHL-Plus, Cochrane Library and Medline. No restriction will be made on publication date. Included studies will encompass clinical trials and observational designs that examine effects or association of vegetarian diet in adults (≥16 years) and report on the incidence, prevalence or progression of MASLD. Grey literature, non-human studies and articles focusing on changes in a specific food or nutraceutical will be excluded. Articles must have an English-language abstract available to be considered for inclusion. Screening and data extraction will be conducted by two independent reviewers. The findings will be summarised with descriptive statistics. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval from a medical ethics committee is not required for this review. Once the review is complete, the findings will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.",

      "abstract": "Acne vulgaris is a common skin condition that affects millions of people worldwide. While the exact cause of acne is not fully understood, it is believed to be influenced by various factors such as the skin microbiome, host immunity, hormones, genetics, and possibly diet. There are several treatment options for acne, including antibiotics and vitamin A derivatives (retinoids). However, these treatments can have side effects, such as dryness, redness, and peeling of the skin. The relationship between diet and acne remains somewhat controversial. Studies have found that Western societies have a higher incidence of acne than non-Western societies, which is believed to be due to dietary differences. Several experiments were conducted to target the skin microbiome and treat acne with the hope of using probiotics orally or topically to regulate the immune response and reduce inflammation in acne. In addition, studies have shown that a plant-based diet can benefit individuals with acne. Avoiding dairy consumption is one of the most effective dietary changes for reducing acne. As part of our investigation, we conducted a review to determine the effect of probiotics and vegetarian diets on acne."

The present study describes a case of a 36-year-old female patient with SCD who demonstrated abnormal changes in the white matter of the brain. The laboratory test results showed a decrease in serum vitamin B12 levels and an increase in homocysteine levels. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed that, in addition to abnormal signals in the cervical and thoracic spine, speckled and short-striped abnormal signals were present, symmetrically distributed in the centrum semiovale. After 6 months of follow-up treatment, cranial MRI showed a significant attenuation of the symmetrical speckled and short-striped abnormal signals in the centrum semiovale. Homocysteine and serum vitamin B12 levels of the patient were within the expected range. Although, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of alterations in the brain of patients with SCD, if these patients report neurological symptoms, clinicians should consider that these symptoms may be accompanied by inflammatory demyelination of the brain."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Flexitarian, vegetarian and exclusively plant-based diets are increasingly popular, particularly amongst young adults. This is the first randomised dietary intervention to investigate the health, wellbeing, and behavioural implications of consuming a basal vegetarian diet that additionally includes low-to-moderate amounts of red meat (flexitarian) compared to one containing plant-based meat alternatives (PBMAs, vegetarian) in young adults (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04869163). The objective for the current analysis is to measure adherence to the intervention, nutrition behaviours, and participants' experience with their allocated dietary group. METHODS: Eighty healthy young adults participated in this 10-week dietary intervention as household pairs. Household pairs were randomised to receive either approximately three serves of red meat (average of 390 g cooked weight per individual, flexitarian group) or PBMAs (350-400 g per individual, vegetarian group) per week on top of a basal vegetarian diet. Participants were supported to adopt healthy eating behaviours, and this intervention was developed and implemented using a behaviour change framework. Adherence (eating allocated red meat or PBMA, abstaining from animal-based foods not provided by researchers) was continuously monitored, with total scores calculated at the end of the 10-week intervention period. Eating experiences were measured by the Positive Eating Scale and a purpose-designed exit survey, and a food frequency questionnaire measured dietary intake. Analyses used mixed effects modeling taking household clustering into account. RESULTS: The total average adherence score was 91.5 (SD = 9.0) out of a possible 100, with participants in the flexitarian group scoring higher (96.1, SD = 4.6, compared to 86.7, SD = 10.0; p < 0.001). Those receiving red meat were generally more satisfied with this allocation compared to those receiving the PBMAs, even though a leading motivation for participants joining the study was an opportunity to try plant-based eating (35% expressed that their interest in taking part was related to trying plant-based eating). Participants in both intervention groups had increased vegetable intake (p < 0.001), and reported more positive eating experiences (p = 0.020) and satisfaction with eating (p = 0.021) at the end of the 10-week intervention relative to baseline values. CONCLUSION: Methods to encourage engagement with the trial were successful, as participants demonstrated excellent adherence to the intervention. Observed differences in participants' adherence and experiences between flexitarian and vegetarian groups holds implications for the adoption of healthy, sustainable dietary patterns beyond this study alone."

METHODS: A search of the PubMed, EBSCO, Embase, CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases was conducted for comparative studies of pre- and post-vegetarian diet adoption combined with aerobic exercise interventions on glycemic control and body composition. Qualitative reviews and meta-analyses of fixed and random effects were conducted to pool available data. The results were validated by sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies were selected for meta-analysis. Combining the studies included in the meta-analysis showed a mean difference for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance of - 0.75 (- 1.08 to - 0.42), fasting plasma glucose of - 0.27(- 0.30 to - 0.23), waist circumference of - 1.10 (- 5.06 to 2.86) and body mass index of - 0.70 (- 1.38 to - 0.01).

Laboratory examination showed moderate macrocytic anemia, high levels of homocysteine, high level of propionylcarnitine/acetylcarnitine, urinary methylmalonic acid and methyl citrate. Gene mutation analysis showed c.609G > A and c.80A > G compound heterozygous mutations in the MMACHC gene, supported late-onset combined methylmalonic academia with homocysteinemia. Then treatment performed with add meat to the diet, vitamin B12, folic acid betaine and L-carnitine supplement.

After initial cancer treatment, they were referred to the Almazov center outpatient specialists for follow-up visits. Many of them were readmitted of the inpatient clinic due to relapse. We extracted a variety of parameters related to lifestyle, dietary habits, socioeconomic, and reproductive features from the inpatient and outpatient databases of Almazov center. The medical records of the women with enough data were included in the study. Prediction of Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed respectively. The AUC of ROC was calculated for PFS = 0.93 and for OS = 0.94.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The type of fat consumed in animal-based western diets, typically rich in the saturated fat palmitate, has been implicated in cardiometabolic disease risk. In contrast, the most abundant mono- and polyunsaturated fats, more typical in a vegetarian or plant-based diet, potentiate less deleterious effects. This study determined differences in plasma and urine metabolites when switching from omnivorous to vegetarian diet, including metabolites involved in fatty acid utilization. METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospective cohort of 38 European (EA) and African American (AA) omnivorous females were matched by age (25.7 ± 5.3y) and BMI (22.4 ± 1.9 kg/m2). Pre-intervention samples were collected while subjects consumed habitual animal-based diet. Changes in metabolites were assessed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (Metabolon, Inc.) upon completing four days of novel vegetarian diet provided by the Vanderbilt Metabolic Kitchen. Changes in several diet-derived metabolites were observed, including increases in compounds derived from soy food metabolism along with decreases in metabolites of xanthine and histidine. Significant changes occurred in metabolites of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids along with significant differences between EA and AA women in changes in plasma concentrations of acylcarnitines, which reflect the completeness of fatty acid oxidation (versus storage). CONCLUSION: These data suggest improvements in fatty acid metabolism (oxidation vs storage), a key factor in energy homeostasis, may be promoted rapidly by adoption of a vegetarian (plant-based) diet. Mechanistic differences in response to diet interventions must be understood to effectively provide protection against the widespread development of obesity and cardiometabolic disease in population subgroups, such as AA women.",

We sought to investigate effects of a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet (VD) on plasma lipidome in CAD patients and simultaneously assess associations of plasma lipids with the extent of coronary atherosclerotic burden. We analyzed 214 plasma lipids within glycerolipid, sphingolipid, and sterol lipid classes using lipidomics from a randomized controlled, crossover trial comprising 31 CAD patients on standard medical therapy. Subjects completed a four-week intervention with VD and isocaloric meat diet (MD), separated by a four-week washout period. The VD increased levels of 11 triacylglycerols and lowered 7 triacylglycerols, 21 glycerophospholipids, cholesteryl ester (18:0), and ceramide (d18:1/16:0) compared with MD. VD increased triacylglycerols with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acyls while decreased triacylglycerols with saturated fatty acyls, phosphatidylcholines, and sphingomyelins than MD. The Sullivan extent score (SES) exhibited on coronary angiograms were inversely associated with triacylglycerols with long-chain unsaturated fatty acyls. Phosphatidylcholines that were lower with VD were positively associated with SES and the total number of stenotic lesions. The VD favorably changed levels of several lipotoxic lipids that have previously been associated with increased risk of coronary events in CAD patients.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Functional constipation is a chronic disease that is common in children and adults around the world. The treatments for functional constipation include diet and lifestyle interventions, medications, and surgery. The diet pattern plays an important role in the occurrence of constipation. We found in clinical practice that simple application of drugs cannot achieve long-term relief of constipation, and a large number of patients are not satisfied with the existing treatment. We have concluded that Qingjiang Tiaochang Recipe (QJTCR) and light vegetarian diet (LVD) can effectively improve constipation. However, there is no enough evidence for the description of the effect. This protocol aims at exploratorily investigating effectiveness and safety of LVD and QJTCR following a rigorous clinical trial. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will recruit 90 patients to participate in this prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, and exploratory study at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, including traditional Chinese medicine group, placebo + diet group, traditional Chinese medicine + diet group. Patients in the diet intervention group must strictly abide by LVD, and the study will continue for 28 days. During the intervention period, we need to record a designed diary to assess diet quality and defecation. The primary outcomes for this clinical study were weekly complete spontaneous bowel movements. The secondary outcomes were constipation-related symptom rating scale, traditional Chinese medicine syndrome scale, and 48-hour gastrointestinal transit time, high-resolution anorectal manometry, Bristol stool score, constipation quality of life assessment scale, constipation symptoms self-assessment scale, short-chain fatty acids in feces. In addition, the study will determine the safety of the intervention.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve T2D subjects (Male to female ratio = 7:5), mean age 63 ± 8.5 years, were enrolled in a randomized, controlled, crossover study. Participants consumed an MED meal as well as an isocaloric meal rich in complex carbohydrate as well as an isocaloric MED meal in two different visits with a 1-week washout period between the two visits. Appetite ratings, glucose/insulin, and gastrointestinal hormone concentrations were measured at fasting and every 30' until 210' following meal consumption. RESULTS: GLP-1 and oxyntomodulin levels were significantly higher following MED meal compared with HFV meals (210' area under the curve, p < 0.022 and p < 0.023, respectively). Both MED and HFV meal resulted in a biphasic pattern of GLP-1 and oxyntomodulin, although MED meal was related to a delayed, significantly higher second GLP-1 peak at 150' compared with that of HFV meal (p < 0.05). MED meal was related to lower glucose profile compared with HFV meal (p < 0.039), whereas we did not observe significant changes in terms of self-reported VAS scores and insulin trend. CONCLUSIONS: In T2D overweight/obese subjects, an MED meal is more effective than a HFV meal in terms of post-prandial plasma glucose homoeostasis and GLP-1 and oxyntomodulin release. These changes were not confirmed by VAS appetite self-assessment over a 210' period.",

      "abstract": "Background A vegetarian diet (VD) may reduce future cardiovascular risk in patients with ischemic heart disease. Methods and Results A randomized crossover study was conducted in subjects with ischemic heart disease, assigned to 4-week intervention periods of isocaloric VD and meat diet (MD) with individually designed diet plans, separated by a 4-week washout period. The primary outcome was difference in oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) between diets. Secondary outcomes were differences in cardiometabolic risk factors, quality of life, gut microbiota, fecal short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids, and plasma metabolome. Of 150 eligible patients, 31 (21%) agreed to participate, and 27 (87%) participants completed the study. Mean oxidized LDL-C (-2.73 U/L), total cholesterol (-5.03 mg/dL), LDL-C (-3.87 mg/dL), and body weight (-0.67 kg) were significantly lower with the VD than with the MD. Differences between VD and MD were observed in the relative abundance of several microbe genera within the families Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Akkermansiaceae. Plasma metabolites, including l-carnitine, acylcarnitine metabolites, and phospholipids, differed in subjects consuming VD and MD. The effect on oxidized LDL-C in response to the VD was associated with a baseline gut microbiota composition dominated by several genera of Ruminococcaceae. Conclusions The VD in conjunction with optimal medical therapy reduced levels of oxidized LDL-C, improved cardiometabolic risk factors, and altered the relative abundance of gut microbes and plasma metabolites in patients with ischemic heart disease. Our results suggest that composition of the gut microbiota at baseline may be related to the reduction of oxidized LDL-C observed with the VD.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Functional constipation (FC) is one of the common gastrointestinal disorders that affects people of almost every age. Persistent FC significantly affects quality of life and well-being along with economic burden on patients as well as health care system. Therapeutic efficacy of currently used treatment strategies becomes limited shortly after their discontinuation as constipation occurs again as a result of inappropriate dietary habits. Previous studies have revealed that light vegetarian diet (LVD) can significantly improve both typical and atypical subtypes of major traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) FC syndrome such as gastrointestinal damp-heat syndrome. This protocol aims at exploratorily investigating effectiveness and safety of LVD following a rigorous clinical trial. METHODS AND DESIGN: Total 92 patients in each of the 2 subtypes will be recruited in China-Japan Friendship Hospital for participating in this prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized trial and exploratory study. The patients in each subtype will be randomly divided into 4 groups according to 1:1:1:1 ratio with allocation concealment, which are drug + diet group, drug group, placebo + diet group and placebo group. Patients in the group with diet intervention will be required to strictly follow the LVD. The study will continue for a period of 28 days, including a drug or placebo supervised intervention and a 14th-day telephone follow-up. During the intervention, patients will be required to record a designed diary for controlling the diet quality (DQ) and analyzing the defecation. The study will focus investigation of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBM) per week as its primary outcome and constipation-related symptom rating scale (CSS), TCM syndrome scale (TCMSS), 48-hour gastrointestinal transit time (48-hour GITT), high resolution anorectal manometry (HRAM) and fecal flora detection (FFD) will be included in secondary outcomes. Furthermore, the study will also determine safety, DQ and compliance indicators. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by China-Japan Friendship Hospital clinical research ethics committee (No. 2017-46-1). A SPIRIT checklist is available for this protocol.

METHODS: We performed next generation sequencing (NGS) of 16S rRNA and SCFA analysis on fecal samples of 23 overweight omnivores (16 F; 7 M) with low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk. They were randomly assigned to a VD or MD, each lasting 3 months, with a crossover study design. RESULTS: Dietary interventions did not produce significant diversity in the GM composition at higher ranks (family and above), neither between nor within MD and VD, but they did it at genus level. MD significantly changed the abundance of Enterorhabdus, Lachnoclostridium and Parabacteroides, while VD significantly affected the abundance of Anaerostipes, Streptococcus, Clostridium sensu stricto, and Odoribacter. Comparison of the mean variation of each SCFA between MD and VD showed an opposite and statistically significant trend for propionic acid (+ 10% vs - 28%, respectively, p = 0.034). In addition, variations of SCFA were negatively correlated with changes of some inflammatory cytokines such as VEGF, MCP-1, IL-17, IP-10 and IL-12, only after MD. Finally, correlation analyses showed a potential relationship-modulated by the two diets-between changes of genera and changes of clinical and biochemical parameters. CONCLUSIONS: A short-term dietary intervention with MD or VD does not induce major change in the GM, suggesting that a diet should last longer than 3 months for scratching the microbial resilience. Changes in SCFA production support their role in modulating the inflammatory response, thus mediating the anti-inflammatory and protective properties of MD.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that vegetarianism can result in a reduction of vitamin B12 circulating levels. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a 3-month dietary intervention with a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet (VD) on the levels of circulating vitamin B12 in a group of omnivores. We analysed fifty-four omnivorous subjects who followed a VD as a first dietary intervention within the CARDIVEG (Cardiovascular Prevention with Vegetarian Diet) study, a dietary intervention study. VD resulted in a significant reduction (P<0·001) of 51·2 % of vitamin B12 intake and in a significant reduction (P=0·005) of 6·2 % of the circulating levels of vitamin B12 (-24·5 pg/ml). Changes in vitamin B12 intake were significantly correlated with changes in circulating levels of vitamin B12 (R 0·61, P<0·001). Subgroup analyses showed that reduction in circulating vitamin B12 levels was more evident in participants who were younger, overweight, non-smokers and had hypercholesterolaemia. A logistic regression analysis showed that a reduction in vitamin B12 intake greater than the first quartile of the delta changes obtained in the study population (-28·5 %) conferred a significantly higher risk of experiencing a decrease in circulating vitamin B12 levels (OR 10·1; 95 % CI 1·3, 76·1). In conclusion, a 3-month VD period determined a significant reduction in circulating levels of vitamin B12, being significantly correlated with the reduction in vitamin B12 intake. Although a well-planned VD can provide adequate nutrition across all life stages, special care must be taken to ensure adequate vitamin B12 intake and to help prevent deficiency."

The lack of knowledge about this disease is one of the main causes that makes complex to make a diagnosis and an appropriate treatment. OBJECTIVE: the main objective of this study was to know the efficacy of a physiotherapy treatment combined with a lacto-vegetarian dietary-nutritional intervention, on low back pain and body composition in women with fibromyalgia. METHODS: twenty-one women were randomly divided into three groups: A (core stabilization exercises + lacto-vegetarian diet), B (placebo + lacto-vegetarian diet) and C (control). The intervention lasted 4 weeks. Pain assessments (EVA scale) and body composition (bioimpedance) were performed at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. RESULTS: group A showed significant changes in pain reduction and body composition at the end of the intervention, increasing muscle mass and decreasing fat mass. In addition, this group significantly improved outcomes compared to groups B and C. The correlations showed a relationship between muscle mass and pain reduction referred to at the end of the study in patients in group A. CONCLUSIONS: four-week intervention program combining core stabilization exercises plus lacto-vegetarian diet in patients with fibromyalgia who have low back pain contributes to pain reduction and improved body composition.",

      "abstract": "Balanced vegetarian diets are popular, although they are nearly absent in creatine and carnosine and contain considerably less carnitine than non-vegetarian diets. Few longitudinal intervention studies investigating the effect of a vegetarian diet on the availability of these compounds currently exist. We aimed to investigate the effect of transiently switching omnivores onto a vegetarian diet for 6 months on muscle and plasma creatine, carnitine and carnosine homeostasis. In a 6-month intervention, forty omnivorous women were ascribed to three groups: continued omnivorous diet (control, n 10), vegetarian diet without supplementation (Veg+Pla, n 15) and vegetarian diet combined with daily β-alanine (0·8-0·4 g/d) and creatine supplementation (1 g creatine monohydrate/d) (Veg+Suppl, n 15). Before (0 months; 0M), after 3 months (3M) and 6 months (6M), a fasted venous blood sample and 24-h urine was collected, and muscle carnosine content was determined by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Muscle biopsies were obtained at 0M and 3M. Plasma creatine and muscle total creatine content declined from 0M to 3M in Veg+Pla (P=0·013 and P=0·009, respectively), whereas plasma creatine increased from 0M in Veg+Suppl (P=0·004). None of the carnitine-related compounds in plasma or muscle showed a significant time×group interaction effect. 1H-MRS-determined muscle carnosine content was unchanged over 6M in control and Veg+Pla, but increased in Veg+Suppl in soleus (P<0·001) and gastrocnemius (P=0·001) muscle. To conclude, the body creatine pool declined over a 3-month vegetarian diet in omnivorous women, which was ameliorated when accompanied by low-dose dietary creatine supplementation. Carnitine and carnosine homeostasis was unaffected by a 3- or 6-month vegetarian diet, respectively.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Only a few randomized dietary intervention studies that investigated the effects of lacto-ovo vegetarian diet (Vd) in clinically healthy omnivorous subjects are available. METHODS: We randomly assigned to overweight omnivores with a low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk profile a low-calorie Vd compared with a low-calorie Mediterranean diet (MD), each lasting 3 months, with a crossover design. The primary outcome was the difference in body weight, body mass index, and fat mass changes between the 2 groups. Secondary outcomes were differences in circulating cardiovascular disease risk parameters changes between the 2 groups. RESULTS: One hundred eighteen subjects (mean age: 51.1 years, females: 78%) were enrolled. The total participation rate at the end of the study was 84.7%. No differences between the 2 diets in body weight were observed, as reported by similar and significant reductions obtained by both Vd (-1.88 kg) and MD (-1.77 kg). Similar results were observed for body mass index and fat mass. In contrast, significant differences between the 2 interventions were obtained for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and vitamin B12 levels. The difference between the Vd and MD groups, in terms of end-of-diet values, was recorded at 9.10 mg/dL for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=0.01), 12.70 mg/dL for triglycerides (P<0.01), and 32.32 pg/mL for vitamin B12 (P<0.01). Finally, no significant difference was found between Vd and MD interventions in oxidative stress markers and inflammatory cytokines, except for interleukin-17, which improved only in the MD group. Forty-six participants during the Vd period and 35 during the MD period reached the target values for ≥1 cardiovascular risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: Both Vd and MD were effective in reducing body weight, body mass index, and fat mass, with no significant differences between them. However, Vd was more effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, whereas MD led to a greater reduction in triglyceride levels.

This is a case report of a young vegetarian woman, accustomed to drink high amounts of tea, who, three weeks after her first natural childbirth, developed serious motor and cognitive disturbances. A timely brain magnetic resonance (MR) allowed us to identify Marchiafava Bignami disease and she healed few hours after the administration of parenteral steroids and vitamins. We advise to suspect Marchiafava Bignami Disease in all patients presenting with non-obvious acute generalized motor and cognitive disturbances, also if non alcoholics, and to collect the nutritional habits in all patients with suspected symptoms. In these cases a timely brain MRI is warranted, since brain imaging is typical and patients may recover after a prompt treatment.",

However, the optimal dietary strategy for cardiovascular disease prevention is still far from being defined. Mediterranean and vegetarian diets are those reporting the greatest grade of evidence in the literature, but no experimental studies comparing these two dietary patterns are available. METHODS/DESIGN: This is an open randomized crossover clinical trial including healthy subjects with a low-to-medium cardiovascular risk profile, characterized by being overweight and by the presence of at least an additional metabolic risk factor (abdominal obesity, high total cholesterol, high LDL cholesterol, high triglycerides, impaired glucose fasting levels) but free from medications. A total of 100 subjects will be included and randomly assigned to two groups: Mediterranean calorie-restricted diet (n = 50) and vegetarian calorie-restricted diet (n = 50). The intervention phases will last 3 months each, and at the end of intervention phase I the groups will be crossed over. The two diets will be isocaloric and of three different sizes (1400 - 1600 - 1800 kcal/day), according to specific energy requirements. Adherence to the dietary intervention will be established through questionnaires and 24-h dietary recall. Anthropometric measurements, body composition, blood samples and stool samples will be obtained from each participant at the beginning and at the end of each intervention phase. The primary outcome measure will be change in weight from baseline. The secondary outcome measures will be variations of anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance variables as well as traditional and innovative cardiovascular biomarkers. DISCUSSION: Despite all the data supporting the efficacy of Mediterranean and vegetarian diets on the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, no studies have directly compared these two dietary profiles. The trial will test whether there are statistically significant differences between these dietary profiles in reducing the cardiovascular risk burden for the general population.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: vegetarian diets have been associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease and a more favourable lipid profile in vegetarians who follow these diets for a long term period in observational studies, but the short-term effects of vegetarian diets are less known. OBJECTIVE: our objective was to analyze the short-term effects of a low-fat vegetarian diet on lipid profile and fasting glucose in previously non-vegetarian subjects from a Mediterranean population. METHODS: we carried out a nutritional intervention study in 159 volunteers (42 men and 117 women). A whole lacto-vegetarian diet low in fat (20%) was administered. A full daily menu was provided for 15 days under strict interned conditions. Fasting blood samples were obtained before and after dietary intervention and total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides and fasting glucose were determined. Multivariate models for repeated measures were used. RESULTS: after dietary intervention, we detected statistically significant reductions in total cholesterol (-17.54 ± 37.14 mg/dl), LDL-C (-9.33 ± 34.29 mg/dl), HDL-C (-5.32 ± 12.16 mg/dl), and triglycerides (-18.92 ± 50.50 mg/dl). These reductions remained statistically significant after adjustment for sex and age. Significant weight changes were also detected. The additional adjustment for changes in body mass index (BMI) attenued the significance of the decrease in triglycerides (P = 0.067). CONCLUSION: a lacto-vegetarian diet low in fat, produces favourable and significant decreases in total cholesterol, LDL-C (independent of weight loss) and triglycerides (mediated by weight loss). This intervention also produced an expected decrease in HDL-C due to its reduced fat content.",

We showed previously that vegetarian diet leads to greater increase in metabolic clearance rate of glucose (MCR) than conventional hypocaloric diet. The aim of this secondary analysis was to explore the role of changes in fatty acid composition of serum phospholipids in diet- and exercise-induced changes in MCR in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: Subjects with T2D (n=74) were randomly assigned into a vegetarian group (VG, n=37) following vegetarian diet or a control group (CG, n=37) following a conventional diet. Both diets were calorie restricted (-500 kcal day(-1)). Participants were examined at baseline, 12 weeks of diet intervention and 24 weeks (subsequent 12 weeks of diet were combined with aerobic exercise). The fatty acid composition of serum phospholipids was measured by gas liquid chromatography. MCR was measured by hyperinsulinemic isoglycemic clamp. Visceral fat (VF) was measured by magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Linoleic acid (LA; 18:2n6) increased in VG (P=0.04), whereas it decreased in CG (P=0.04) in response to dietary interventions. It did not change significantly after the addition of exercise in either group (group × time P<0.001). In VG, changes in 18:2n6 correlated positively with changes in MCR (r=+0.22; P=0.04) and negatively with changes in VF (r=-0.43; P=0.01). After adjustment for changes in body mass index, the association between 18:2n6 and MCR was no longer significant. The addition of exercise resulted in greater changes of phospholipid fatty acids composition in VG than in CG. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the insulin-sensitizing effect of a vegetarian diet might be related to the increased proportion of LA in serum phospholipids."

RESULTS: Participants were mainly women (86.9%) and white (70.5%); 75% completed the 18-mo study. A significant interaction between preference and dietary treatment was not observed for any of the outcome variables. However, participants in the Preference-No groups significantly decreased their triacylglycerols (P = 0.04). The only effect observed for diet was a borderline significant decrease in LDL:HDL cholesterol for the LOV-D group (P = 0.06). Within the LOV-D groups, those who were 100% adherent to the LOV-D had significant and marginally significant reductions in monounsaturated fat (P = 0.02) and total fat (P = 0.05) intakes at 18 mo. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that neither prescribing a vegetarian diet nor allowing persons to choose their preferred diet had a significant effect on outcome measures. However, all participants had a significant reduction in total energy and fat intakes and an increase in energy expenditure, which was reflected in reduced body weight. This clinical trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00330629.",

OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term weight-loss efficacy of 2 cal and fat-restricted diets, standard (omnivorous) versus lacto-ovo-vegetarian, and to determine the effect of a chosen diet versus an assigned diet. DESIGN, SUBJECTS: A randomized clinical trial was conducted with 176 adults who were sedentary and overweight (mean body mass index, 34.0 kg/m(2)). Participants were first randomly assigned to either receive their preferred diet or be assigned to a diet group and second, were given their diet of preference or randomly assigned to a standard weight-loss diet or a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet. Participants underwent a university-based weight-control program consisting of daily dietary and exercise goals plus 12 months of behavioral counseling followed by a 6-month maintenance phase. MEASUREMENTS: Percentage change in body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, low- and high-density lipoprotein, glucose, insulin and macronutrient intake. RESULTS: The program was completed by 132 (75%) of the participants. At 18 months, mean percentage weight loss was greater (P=0.01) in the two groups that were assigned a diet (standard, 8.0% (s.d., 7.8%); vegetarian, 7.9% (s.d., 8.1%)) than in those provided the diet of their choice (standard, 3.9% (s.d., 6.1%); vegetarian, 5.3% (s.d., 6.2%)). No difference was observed in weight loss between the two types of diet. Over the 18-month program, all groups showed significant weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: Participants assigned to their dietary preference did not have enhanced treatment outcomes. However, all groups lost weight with losses ranging from 4 to 8% at 18 months.",

However, the best approach in the wait for transplantation has not yet been defined. AIM: To evaluate our experience with a low-protein (0.6 g/kg/day) vegetarian diet supplemented with alpha-chetoanalogues in type 1 diabetic patients in the wait for pancreas-kidney transplantation. METHODS: Prospective study. Information on the progression of renal disease, compliance, metabolic control, reasons for choice and for drop-out were recorded prospectively; the data for the subset of patients who underwent the diet while awaiting a pancreas-kidney graft are analysed in this report. RESULTS: From November 1998 to April 2004, 9 type 1 diabetic patients, wait-listed or performing tests for wait-listing for pancreas-kidney transplantation, started the diet. All of them were followed by nephrologists and diabetologists, in the context of integrated care. There were 4 males and 5 females; median age 38 years (range 27.9-45.5); median diabetes duration 23.8 years (range 16.6-33.1), 8/9 with widespread organ damage; median creatinine at the start of the diet: 3.2 mg/dl (1.2-7.2); 4 patients followed the diet to transplantation, 2 are presently on the diet, 2 dropped out and started dialysis after a few months, 1 started dialysis (rescue treatment). The nutritional status remained stable, glycemia control improved in 4 patients in the short term and in 2 in the long term, no hyperkalemia, acidosis or other relevant side effect was recorded. Proteinuria decreased in 5 cases, in 3 from the nephrotic range. Albumin levels remained stable; the progression rate was a loss of 0.47 ml/min of creatinine clearance per month (ranging from an increase of 0.06 to a decrease of 2.4 ml/min) during the diet period (estimated by the Cockroft-Gault formula). CONCLUSIONS: Low-protein supplemented vegetarian diets may be a useful tool to slow CKD progression whilst awaiting pancreas-kidney transplantation."

According to the type of antiatherogenic diet, 67 patients were divided into 2 groups: 1) 42 patients were on an antiatherogenic vegetarian diet (a vegetarian group--VG) and 2) 25 patients received routine mixed diet No. 10c (a control group--CG). At the same time all the patients received similar antianginal drug therapy including the selective beta-AB atenolol in a dose of 50 mg/day. The vegetarian diet without special hypolipidemic therapy had a marked normalizing effect on the serum lipid spectrum in patients with CHD. Thus, in VG, by the end of treatment, the level of total cholesterol significantly decreased by 16% while in the controls it increased by 13%. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased in VG and decreased in CG, therefore the atherogenicity coefficient considerably rose. These were true for triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. These parameters significantly decreased in VG (by more than 30%) and increased in CG (by 16%). Among the clinical symptoms, a more pronounced decrease in blood pressure in the patients on vegetarian diet and a more significant increase in their exercise tolerance. Balanced antiatherogenic milk-and-vegetable diet in patients with coronary heart disease prevents the hyperlipidemic effect caused by the selective beta-AB atenolol and it is an agent for preventing its negative effect on lipid metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Based on what is known of the components of plant-based diets and their effects from cohort studies, there is reason to believe that vegetarian diets would have advantages in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. At present there are few data on vegetarian diets in diabetes that do not in addition have weight loss or exercise components. Nevertheless, the use of whole-grain or traditionally processed cereals and legumes has been associated with improved glycemic control in both diabetic and insulin-resistant individuals. Long-term cohort studies have indicated that whole-grain consumption reduces the risk of both type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In addition, nuts (eg, almonds), viscous fibers (eg, fibers from oats and barley), soy proteins, and plant sterols, which may be part of the vegetarian diet, reduce serum lipids. In combination, these plant food components may have a very significant impact on cardiovascular disease, one of the major complications of diabetes. Furthermore, substituting soy or other vegetable proteins for animal protein may also decrease renal hyperfiltration, proteinuria, and renal acid load and in the long term reduce the risk of developing renal disease in type 2 diabetes. The vegetarian diet, therefore, contains a portfolio of natural products and food forms of benefit for both the carbohydrate and lipid abnormalities in diabetes. It is anticipated that their combined use in vegetarian diets will produce very significant metabolic advantages for the prevention and treatment of diabetes and its complications.",

Values of glutaric and -hydroxyglutaric acids in urine are usually increased. Currently, the disease is considered untreatable since there are usually irreversible lesions in the central nervous system at diagnosis. However, treatment can be provided to pre-symptomatic children and usually to the siblings of patients with this diagnosis. We present the case of a 23-month-old boy, with macrocephaly and minimal neurologic manifestations at diagnosis, which were attributed to his semivegetarian diet. A dietary regimen and vitamin supplementation halted and even improved symptomatic progression of the disease.

An open-trial study was carried out in twenty patients with atopic dermatitis. An improvement of dermatitis was evaluated by SCORAD index and serological and immunological parameters were monitored. After a two-month treatment, the severity of dermatitis was strikingly inhibited, as assessed by SCORAD index and serological parameters including LDH5 activity and a number of peripheral eosinophils. A sharp reduction in eosinophils and neutrophils was observed prior to improvement in the skin inflammation. In addition, PGE2 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells was reduced by this treatment. In contrast, serum IgE levels did not change during the same period.

In this study we tested whether a mostly raw vegetarian diet would significantly improve fibromyalgia symptoms. METHODS: Thirty people participated in a dietary intervention using a mostly raw, pure vegetarian diet. The diet consisted of raw fruits, salads, carrot juice, tubers, grain products, nuts, seeds, and a dehydrated barley grass juice product. Outcomes measured were dietary intake, the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ), SF-36 health survey, a quality of life survey (QOLS), and physical performance measurements. RESULTS: Twenty-six subjects returned dietary surveys at 2 months; 20 subjects returned surveys at the beginning, end, and at either 2 or 4 months of intervention; 3 subjects were lost to follow-up. The mean FIQ score (n = 20) was reduced 46% from 51 to 28. Seven of the 8 SF-36 subscales, bodily pain being the exception, showed significant improvement (n = 20, all P for trend < 0.01). The QOLS, scaled from 0 to 7, rose from 3.9 initially to 4.9 at 7 months (n = 20, P for trend 0.000001). Significant improvements (n = 18, P < 0.03, paired t-test) were seen in shoulder pain at rest and after motion, abduction range of motion of shoulder, flexibility, chair test, and 6-minute walk. 19 of 30 subjects were classified as responders, with significant improvement on all measured outcomes, compared to no improvement among non-responders. At 7 months responders' SF-36 scores for all scales except bodily pain were no longer statistically different from norms for women ages 45-54. CONCLUSION: This dietary intervention shows that many fibromyalgia subjects can be helped by a mostly raw vegetarian diet.",

This study was undertaken to assess whether any reduction of such proteins by exclusion of animal protein from the diet reduced pain and morbidity in fibromyalgia patients. It was an open, randomized controlled trial. 37 subjects with fibromyalgia were enrolled in the vegetarian diet and 41 in the amitriptyline groups. The outcome was assessed with the help of frequencies of fatigue, insomnia & non-restorative sleep, pain score on a 10-point VAS and tender point count. Fatigue, insomnia and non-restorative sleep were present in 41, 26 and 32 subjects before and in 3, 0 and 0 subjects respectively at six weeks of treatment in the amitriptyline group. The pain score and tender point count were 6.2 +/- 1.9 & 16.1 +/- 2.3 before and 2.3 +/- 1.3 & 6.4 +/- 3.0 after treatment. All these differences were significant (P < 0.001). In the vegetarian diet group, fatigue, insomnia and non-restorative sleep were present in 36, 24 and 27 subjects before and in 34, 29 and 29 subjects at six weeks of treatment. The pain score and tender point count were 5.7 +/- 1.8 and 15.7 +/- 2.4 before and 5.0 +/- 1.8 & 14.7 +/- 3.6 after treatment. All these differences were insignificant except that in the pain score. The decrease in the pain score, though significant, was much smaller than that in the amitriptyline group. So, it may be concluded that vegetarian diet is a poor option in the treatment of fibromyalgia.",

We reviewed the available scientific evidence, because patients frequently ask for dietary advice, and exclusive pharmacological treatment of RA is often not satisfying. Fasting studies in RA were searched in MEDLINE and by checking references in relevant reports. The results of the controlled studies which reported follow-up data for at least three months after fasting were quantitatively pooled. Thirty-one reports of fasting studies in patients with RA were found. Only four controlled studies investigated the effects of fasting and subsequent diets for at least three months. The pooling of these studies showed a statistically and clinically significant beneficial long-term effect. Thus, available evidence suggests that fasting followed by vegetarian diets might be useful in the treatment of RA. More randomised long-term studies are needed to confirm this view by methodologically convincing data.",

None has examined the cholesterol-lowering effect of a low-fat vegetarian diet, which, in other population groups, leads to marked reductions in serum cholesterol concentrations and, in combination with other life-style changes, a regression of atherosclerosis. We tested the hypothesis that a low-fat, vegetarian diet significantly reduces serum total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations in premenopausal women. In a crossover design, 35 women, aged 22 to 48, followed a low-fat vegetarian diet deriving approximately 10% of energy from fat for 2 menstrual cycles. For 2 additional cycles, they followed their customary diet while also taking a \"supplement\" (placebo) pill. Serum lipid concentrations were assessed at baseline and during each intervention phase. Mean serum LDL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and total cholesterol concentrations decreased 16. 9%, 16.5%, and 13.2%, respectively, from baseline to the intervention diet phase (p<0.001), whereas mean serum triacylglycerol concentration increased 18.7% (p<0.01). LDL/HDL ratio remained unchanged. Thus, in healthy premenopausal women, a low-fat vegetarian diet led to rapid and sizable reductions in serum total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol concentrations.",

In one study (Study 1, n = 4) two isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diets were consumed for a period of 10 d each. One diet (diet A) was animal protein rich (74%), the other one (diet V) contained 67% of vegetable protein. Albumin synthesis rate was measured from L-[(2)H(5)]phenylalanine incorporation (43 mg/kg) at the end of each dietary period. Both albumin fractional synthesis rate (FSR) (5.7 +/- 0.6 vs. 6.7 +/- 0. 8%/d, P = 0.04) and absolute synthesis rate (ASR) (123 +/- 6 vs. 143 +/- 8 mg. kg(-1). d(-1), P = 0.05) were reduced after diet V. In a second study (Study 2, n = 8) a third dietary treatment was added (Diet VS). This was similar to diet V but supplemented with soy protein (18g/d). The results of study 2 confirmed that albumin synthesis was reduced after diet V (FSR: 5.9 +/- 0.3 vs. 6.7 +/- 0. 5%/d, P = 0.015; ASR: 126 +/- 7 vs. 146 +/- 9 mg. kg(-1). d(-1), P = 0.007), but it also showed that the drop could be prevented by adding supplemental protein to the predominantly vegetarian diet (Diet VS) (FSR: 6.4 +/- 0.3%/d, P = 0.08; ASR: 140 +/- 7 mg. kg(-1). d(-1), P = 0.03). Albumin synthesis appears to be modulated by changes in the proportion of animal vs. vegetable protein occurring in the diet. The mechanism might be related to differences in digestibility and consequently in net amino acid availability between diets.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether glycemic and lipid control in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) can be significantly improved using a low-fat, vegetarian (vegan) diet in the absence of recommendations regarding exercise or other lifestyle changes. METHODS: Eleven subjects with NIDDM recruited from the Georgetown University Medical Center or the local community were randomly assigned to a low-fat vegan diet (seven subjects) or a conventional low-fat diet (four subjects). Two additional subjects assigned to the control group failed to complete the study. The diets were not designed to be isocaloric. Fasting serum glucose, body weight, medication use, and blood pressure were assessed at baseline and biweekly thereafter for 12 weeks. Serum lipids, glycosylated hemoglobin, urinary albumin, and dietary macronutrients were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks. RESULTS: Although the sample was intentionally small in accordance with the pilot study design, the 28% mean reduction in fasting serum glucose of the experimental group, from 10.7 to 7.75 mmol/L (195 to 141 mg/dl), was significantly greater than the 12% decrease, from 9.86 to 8.64 mmol/L (179 to 157 mg/dl), for the control group (P < 0.05). The mean weight loss was 7.2 kg in the experimental group, compared to 3. 8 kg for the control group (P < 0.005). Of six experimental group subjects on oral hypoglycemic agents, medication use was discontinued in one and reduced in three. Insulin was reduced in both experimental group patients on insulin. No patient in the control group reduced medication use. Differences between the diet groups in the reductions of serum cholesterol and 24-h microalbuminuria did not reach statistical significance; however, high-density lipoprotein concentration fell more sharply (0.20 mmol/L) in the experimental group than in the control group (0.02 mmol/L) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The use of a low-fat, vegetarian diet in patients with NIDDM was associated with significant reductions in fasting serum glucose concentration and body weight in the absence of recommendations for exercise. A larger study is needed for confirmation.",

Elevated plasma fibrinogen levels and decreased fibrinolytic activity have been identified as major independent cardiovascular risk factors. In this study, we compared the blood pressure, plasma fibrinogen concentration, and fibrinolytic activity of 40 nonvegetarians (NON-VEGs) with 36 vegetarians (8 VEGs and 28 SEMI-VEGs). The latter group consisted of students and lecturers of the Adventist Seminary Institute of West Africa, Ilishan Remo. All subjects had blood pressures below 140/90 mmHg, no underlying haemostatic disorders and were not on any medical treatment. The NON-VEGs had significantly decreased fibrinolytic activity (p<0.001) and increased plasma fibrinogen levels (p<0.001) compared with the SEMI-VEGs and VEGs. There were no significant differences between the blood pressure levels of the three groups, although the NON-VEGs had lower diastolic blood pressures. It is concluded that black African Seventh-Day Adventists who follow a vegetarian diet may be protected against premature cardiovascular disease because of beneficial dietary effects on plasma fibrinogen levels and fibrinolytic activity.",

Urine samples were collected from 22 patients who were referred to a health farm for various reasons. The dietary regimen recommended by the health farm consisted of fasting for 7 to 10 days followed by a vegan diet. The growth of both bacteria in urine samples collected after 8 days was significantly slower than in samples collected at baseline.

METHODS: Sera were collected from 53 RA patients who took part in a controlled clinical trial of fasting and a one year vegetarian diet. P mirabilis and E coli antibody levels were measured by an indirect immunofluorescence technique and an enzyme immunoassay, respectively. RESULTS: The patients on the vegetarian diet had a significant reduction in the mean anti-proteus titres at all time points during the study, compared with baseline values (all p < 0.05). No significant change in titre was observed in patients who followed an omnivorous diet. The decrease in anti-proteus titre was greater in the patients who responded well to the vegetarian diet compared with diet non-responders and omnivores. The total IgG concentration and levels of antibody against E coli, however, were almost unchanged in all patient groups during the trial. The decrease from baseline in proteus antibody levels correlated significantly (p < 0.001) with the decrease in a modified Stoke disease activity index. CONCLUSION: The decrease in P mirabilis antibody levels in the diet responders and the correlation between the decrease in proteus antibody level and decrease in disease activity supports the suggestion of an aetiopathogenetic role for P mirabilis in RA.",

The present study was carried out to examine to what extent biochemical and immunological variables changed during the clinical trial of fasting and vegetarian diet. For the patients who were randomised to the vegetarian diet there was a significant decrease in platelet count, leukocyte count, calprotectin, total IgG, IgM rheumatoid factor (RF), C3-activation products, and the complement components C3 and C4 after one month of treatment. None of the measured parameters changed significantly during this period in the group of omnivores. The course of 14 of 15 measured variables favored the vegetarians compared with the omnivores, but the difference was only significant for leukocyte count, IgM RF, and the complement components C3 and C4. Most of the laboratory variables declined considerably in the vegetarians who improved according to clinical variables, indicating a substantial reduction in inflammatory activity. The leukocyte count, however, decreased in the vegetarians irrespective of the clinical results. Thus, the decline in leukocyte count may be attributed to vegetarian diet per se and not to the reduction in disease activity. The results of the present study are in accordance with the findings from the clinical trial, namely that dietary treatment can reduce the disease activity in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",

      "abstract": "In a controlled, single blind clinical trial we have demonstrated recently a beneficial effect of fasting and vegetarian diet in RA. In the present study we compared 53 patients who participated in this clinical trial with 71 other RA patients with regard to some psychological parameters. The patients who participated in the clinical trial differed significantly from other RA patients. Firstly, they had a higher internal score and a lower chance score on the Multi-dimensional Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLCS). Secondly, their belief in the effect of ordinary medical treatment, evaluated by a 10-cm visual analogue scale, was lower, and their belief in the effect of 'alternative', unconventional forms of treatment was higher. Of the patients who were randomized to a vegetarian diet, there was no significant difference between diet responders and diet non-responders with regard to the MHLCS scores. But, diet responders had a significantly lower belief in the effect of ordinary medical treatment compared with diet non-responders. The psychological distress imposed on the patients by changing from an omnivorous diet to a vegetarian diet was monitored during the clinical trial by means of the General Health Questionnaire. Throughout the clinical trial, this variable favoured the vegetarians compared with the omnivorous and the diet responders vs the diet non-responders. We conclude, firstly, that patients with certain psychological characteristics were selected to the clinical trial; secondly, that the MHLCS scores could not explain the clinical improvement, but it may have been influenced by the patients' beliefs in ordinary and 'alternative' forms of treatment; and thirdly, that dietary treatment decreased psychological distress.",

      "abstract": "The literature indicates that copper (Cu) is less bioavailable from a vegetarian as compared to mixed diet. Further, several groups, including ours, find rather marginal average Cu intake in the typical American diet. For example, our data indicate that Wilson's disease patients on a typical American diet ingest only about 25% more Cu than is required. This suggests that a vegetarian diet, if it reduced bioavailability by about 25% or more, would be an adequate maintenance therapy for Wilson's disease. Observations in two of our patients, who were on lactovegetarian diets by choice, and who were almost totally noncompliant with anti-Cu therapy, support this view. These observations suggest that vegetarian diets may be a management tool for Wilson's disease. They also further emphasize the marginal Cu intake in American diets, and suggest that some seemingly healthy people, particularly vegetarians, may be at risk for mild Cu deficiency.",

The effect of fasting followed by one year of a vegetarian diet was assessed in a randomised, single-blind controlled trial. 27 patients were allocated to a four-week stay at a health farm. After an initial 7-10 day subtotal fast, they were put on an individually adjusted gluten-free vegan diet for 3.5 months. The food was then gradually changed to a lactovegetarian diet for the remainder of the study. A control group of 26 patients stayed for four weeks at a convalescent home, but ate an ordinary diet throughout the whole study period. After four weeks at the health farm the diet group showed a significant improvement in number of tender joints, Ritchie's articular index, number of swollen joints, pain score, duration of morning stiffness, grip strength, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, and a health assessment questionnaire score. In the control group, only pain score improved score. In the control group, only pain score improved significantly. The benefits in the diet group were still present after one year, and evaluation of the whole course showed significant advantages for the diet group in all measured indices. This dietary regimen seems to be a useful supplement to conventional medical treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.",

Earlier studies of vegetarians focused on religious groups and on vegans, making it difficult to know whether their lower blood pressures were due to diet per se or to other aspects of lifestyle. Seventh-day Adventist vegetarians showed significantly less hypertension and lower blood pressures compared with Mormon omnivores, effects which were independent of differences in obesity and not due to altered sodium intake. Subsequently, controlled dietary intervention studies in healthy normotensive omnivores provided more direct evidence for a blood pressure-lowering effect of a lactoovovegetarian diet with reversible changes of 5-6 mm Hg systolic and 2-3 mm Hg diastolic occurring over 6-wk periods. Similar dietary effects in mild hypertensive subjects provides impetus for identifying the responsible nutrients.",

Most weekday meals were obtained from a single source and dietary records were completed to assess the changes in nutrient intakes. Blood was collected in the 6th wk of each dietary period. Because of strong correlations between many of the changes in nutrient intakes, principal component (factor) analysis was used followed by stepwise multiple regression analysis to identify associations between changes in diet and changes in lipid, lipoprotein or apoprotein levels. Three principal components accounted for 92.0% of the variation in lipid levels: factor 1 represented an increase in saturated fat, total fat, monounsaturated fat, cholesterol, and energy intake: factor 2 represented an increase in fiber and polyunsaturated fat, and decrease in protein intake; factor 3 an increase in total carbohydrate, complex carbohydrate, and energy intake. Where a change in a variable was significantly associated with change in diet, one factor appeared primarily responsible for the change; total cholesterol (factor 2, p = 0.034); triglyceride (factor 3, p = 0.005); apo-HDL (factor 1, p = 0.014); HDL2-C (factor 2, p = 0.023), HDL3-C (factor 3, p = 0.015).

Ninety-eight Seventh-day Adventist \"vegetarians\" were similar to 113 Mormon omnivores for strength of religious affiliation, consumption of alcohol, tea and coffee and use of tobacco, but were significantly less obese and had significantly lower blood pressures adjusted for age, height and weight. A random sample of forty-seven Adventist vegetarians had significantly lower home blood pressures, serum cholesterol levels and blood pressure responses to a cold-pressor test than Mormon omnivores carefully matched for age, sex and Quetelet's index. In a controlled dietary intervention study mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures and serum cholesterol fell significantly during feeding with a vegetarian diet--an effect unrelated to changes in other lifestyle factors. Dietary analysis indicated that a vegetarian diet provided more polyunsaturated fat, fibre, vitamin C, vitamin E, magnesium, calcium and potassium and significantly less total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol than an omnivore diet. There was no evidence for a difference between vegetarians and omnivores in levels of catecholamines, plasma renin activity, angiotensin II, cortisol or serum and urinary prostanoids.",

Twenty six subjects belonged to a lacto-vegetarian community, while the remaining 280 were healthy volunteers, factory workmen sampled during a regular check-up, and either outpatients or inpatients being evaluated for minor illnesses or minor surgery. None of the subjects had arteriosclerosis or a metabolic disease and, with the exception of the lacto-vegetarians, they were all consuming a normal diet. HDL-C concentrations varied very little among the different age groups. Females had HDL-C values slightly superior to those of males. No significant differences were found between smokers and non-smokers, alcohol drinkers and non-drinkers, and regularly exercising and sedentary people. HDL-C concentrations were independent of total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Females under oral contraceptive treatment had lower HDL-C levels than control females, but the differences were not statistically significant. Compared with age and sex-matched controls, the lactovegetarians showed similar HDL-C concentrations.",
