      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: Gastric cancer (GC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of tumorigenesis. This study investigated the role of the miR-192/215-early growth response protein 1 (EGR1) axis in GC and explored its therapeutic implications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Combinatorial molecular approaches including dual-luciferase reporter assays and western blot analyses were employed to authenticate EGR1 as a direct target of miR-192/215. Multi-modal data analysis incorporating The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets and our institutional cohort (n=56) was conducted to delineate EGR1 expression profiles across clinicopathological GC stages. Pharmacological modulation studies were implemented to characterize the dose- and time-dependent effects of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on the miR-192/215-EGR1 axis. RESULTS: EGR1 is a direct target of miR-192/215, with its expression negatively regulated by these miRNAs. Clinical analysis revealed significantly reduced EGR1 expression in tumors of early-stage GC (stage I) and cases with superficial invasion depth (T1) (p<0.05), suggesting a tumor-promoting role in the early stages of the disease. Higher EGR1 levels were associated with poorer overall survival, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (p<0.05). Furthermore, treatment of cells with EGCG transiently up-regulated miR-192/215 and down-regulated EGR1, highlighting its therapeutic potential. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the miR-192/215-EGR1 axis as a critical regulator of GC progression and a promising therapeutic target. EGCG may serve as an adjunct therapy for GC. Future studies should focus on the regulatory mechanisms of EGR1, its interaction with the tumor microenvironment, and clinical validation of EGCG and other agents targeting this axis.",

      "abstract": "Embryo implantation failure is a significant challenge in infertility treatment, accounting for a substantial number of treatment failures. Increasing endometrial receptivity can potentially overcome this issue. This study aims to introduce a novel approach for enhancing endometrial receptivity by preparing epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)-loaded menstrual blood-derived exosomes. Menstrual blood was used to isolate exosomes, which were then characterized for their size, zeta potential, morphology, and surface markers. EGCG was loaded into the isolated exosomes using sonication. The effects of EGCG-loaded exosomes on the adhesion ability of endometrial cells and the expression of endometrial receptivity-related genes were evaluated using in vitro implantation assays and real-time PCR, respectively. As results, exosomes with an average size of 86.2 nm, a surface charge of -11.8 mV, spherical morphology, and positive for CD9 and CD81 surface markers were successfully isolated. EGCG was loaded into exosomes with an encapsulation efficiency of 65.18%. The in vitro implantation assay confirmed that EGCG-loaded exosomes had a greater potential to enhance the adhesion ability of endometrial cells compared to free EGCG. Furthermore, EGCG-loaded exosomes upregulated the expression of Leukemia inhibitory factor, homeobox A10, and integrin beta 3 genes more potently compared to free EGCG. These findings suggest that EGCG-loaded exosomes could be a therapeutic option for low endometrial receptivity. Moreover, menstrual blood-derived exosomes appear to be a promising drug delivery system for endometrial cells, offering a potential solution to the therapeutic limitations of the payload."

      "abstract": "Head and neck cancer, as one of the most common cancers, causes the death of many people worldwide every year. The current approaches to treat this cancer have not been successful, and recurrence, drug-resistance development, side effects, and high treatment costs are important problems necessitating the need for more effective drugs and treatment approaches. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the most plentiful and biological-active catechin in green tea with proved anticancer effect. However, the stability, low bioavailability, and short half-life, limits its clinical use. Nanocarrier development may overcome these deficiencies by improving pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the nano-emulsion containing EGCG for their anticancer activity. First, EGCG nano-emulsion was prepared, which was then characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The toxicity of the nano-emulsion on the TSCC-1 cancer cell line was assessed by MTT and LDH assays. Cell migration rate, colony-formation ability, the apoptosis rate, and the expression level of BAX, BCL2, and VEGF genes after treatment of cancer cells were assessed. Moreover, the effect of EGCG nano-emulsion on the spheroid growth of TSCC-1 cells in three-dimensional (3D) culture was investigated. The FTIR results demonstrated the presence of EGCG in the nano-emulsion. The size and zeta potential of the nano-emulsion with and without EGCG were 17.53 ± 1.62 nm and - 0.166 ± 0.169 mV, and 14.0 ± 2.3 nm and - 0.266 ± 0.169 mV, respectively. The sustained drug release was observed. Moreover, the MTT assay exhibited that the cytotoxicity of the nano-emulsion was significant at a concentration of 80 µg/mL on TSCC-1 cells. The colony-formation assay revealed no colonies in the groups treated with nano-emulsion containing EGCG compared to the control group. The scratch test also showed the ability of nano-emulsion to inhibit cell migration. Furthermore, the induction of delayed apoptosis by 88.3 ± 3.18% was observed in the group treated with EGCG nano-emulsion at a concentration of 80 µg/mL. The expression of BCL2 and VEGF genes significantly decreased, while that of BAX gene increased. Moreover, the 3D culture showed a decrease in the size and growth of spheroids in the EGCG nano-emulsion-treated group compared to the control group. The results showed that the nano-emulsion containing EGCG has significant anticancer activity (TSCC-1) and may be a suitable treatment option for the management of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck."

The researchers assessed inactivation and injury rates, cell morphology, and antioxidant indicators of E. coli when subjected to different concentrations of EGCG. The results showed that varying EGCG concentrations produced damaged bacteria, with the extent of damage depending on EGCG dosage and treatment duration. The disinfection process involving EGCG resulted in oxidative damage in E. coli, evoking alterations in the antioxidant system of the affected bacteria. During disinfection-induced bacterial injury, E. coli showed the active regulation of metabolism and redox activities in response to EGCG-induced environmental stimuli. Transcriptomic analysis was conducted to investigate the damage mechanism at the gene level. The damaged E. coli countered oxidative stress by adjusting gene expression related to peroxidase and glutathione metabolism processes. In this way, E. coli adjusts its gene expression to alleviate the detrimental effects of EGCG-induced oxidative stress and maintain cellular homeostasis. These findings contribute to our understanding of tea polyphenols' disinfection effects and provide insights into EGCG's mechanisms of damaging bacteria such as E. coli.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cuproptosis is a form of copper-dependent non-apoptotic cell death. Cancer cells that prefer to use aerobic glycolysis for energy generation are commonly insensitive to cuproptosis, which hinders its application for cancer treatment. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) possesses diverse pharmacological activities. However, the association between EGCG and cuproptosis has not been studied. METHODS: The cell viability, proliferation, and cuproptosis-related protein levels were detected to investigate whether EGCG enhances the sensitivity of HCC cells to cuproptosis. The intracellular copper level, related copper metabolism proteins, and gene expression were detected to explore the mechanisms. In addition, a nude mouse xenograft model was established to determine the effects of EGCG on cuproptosis in tumor tissues. RESULTS: The combination of EGCG and copper ionophores significantly enhanced the mortality of HCC cells and heightened the sensitivity of HCC cells to cuproptosis. There was a notable reduction in the expression of copper export protein copper-transporting P-type ATPase (ATP7B). EGCG effectively suppressed metal regulatory transcription factor (MTF1) expression and subsequently hindered the transcriptional regulation of ATP7B. EGCG also facilitated the intratumoral accumulation of copper and augmented susceptibility to cuproptosis in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: EGCG can increase the sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells to cuproptosis by promoting intracellular copper accumulation through the MTF1/ATP7B axis.",

      "abstract": "Previous epidemiological studies have suggested that green tea catechins, including Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant polyphenol in green tea, may be associated with reduced serum folate levels. This is of particular interest as women of childbearing age may be consuming EGCG from tea, dietary supplements, or involved in active clinical trials studying EGCG or green tea extract. EGCG was reported to shrink uterine fibroids in preclinical and clinical studies. This observation led to the development of a multicenter NICHD-funded clinical trial to evaluate the safety of EGCG for treating women with fibroids and unexplained infertility (NCT04177693). To answer the question of whether green tea extract standardized to EGCG led to a reduction in folate, 39 women aged ≥ 18 to ≤ 40 years, with/without uterine fibroids, were evaluated. These women were randomized to receive either EGCG, EGCG + clomiphene, or EGCG + letrozole for 30 days. A daily dose of 720 mg of highly characterized green tea extract containing EGCG was used. Participants were genotyped for polymorphisms at positions 677 and 1298 in MTHFR and for the -19 bp deletion polymorphism of DHFR. During the intervention with EGCG, folate levels remained in the normal range in all subjects. Our data suggest that in reproductive-age women, a 30-day course of EGCG 720 mg daily taken alone or in combination with clomiphene citrate or letrozole (for 5 days) is well-tolerated and is not associated with folate deficiency even in the presence of MTHFR and/or DHFR polymorphisms known to negatively impact folate synthesis.

The resulting hydrogel CL has good antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli, as well as appropriate water content (>40 %), anti-swelling, light transmittance (>90 %), and mechanical qualities. The resulting hydrogel CL was biocompatible, had strong antioxidant qualities, good ROS scavenging ability and did not negatively impact normal cells due to the presence of EGCG. Additionally, studies on animals revealed that the hydrogel CL produced reduced the duration of BK therapy without causing any harm to the eye's tissue and was more effective than the antibiotic levofloxacin, offering a more successful plan for the clinical management of BK."

      "abstract": "Glaucoma is a serious cause of permanent blindness worldwide, mainly caused by inflammation and degeneration of the optic nerve. However, current treatments using systemically administered drugs have limited effectiveness due to various biological barriers that prevent their biodistribution in the eye. To overcome these challenges, we developed a new therapy that utilizes intranasal delivery to retinal lesions. In this therapy, we used platelet extracellular vesicles (pEVs) as carriers for epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which is known for its neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. We hypothesized that this therapy could overcome ocular barriers, increase drug bioavailability, and mitigate glaucoma progression. We conducted extensive characterization of the biochemical and biophysical properties of the EGCG-pEVs, and the results were promising. In vivo tests using an animal model of dexamethasone-induced glaucoma showed that intranasal administration of EGCG-pEVs was safe and had superior drug delivery and therapeutic efficacy, including anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and intraocular pressure-reducing effects, compared to an intraperitoneal injection or ophthalmic drug administration routes.

However, the function role of EGCG in PD and the underlying mechanism remains to be investigated. In the current study, we used the rotenone injection to build the PD rat model, followed by the EGCG treatment and determined by the behavior tests, measurements of malondialdehyde, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase levels, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We revealed that, in PD rats, EGCG upregulates protein kinase D1 (PKD1) and inhibits Parthanatos to ameliorate the impaired motor function, reduce the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, suppress the oxidative stress, and suppress the inflammation in substantia nigra. These combined results suggest that EGCG can suppress oxidative stress and inflammation to prevent DA neuron degeneration to prevent rotenone-induced motor impairments, laying the foundation for EGCG to be a novel candidate for the treatment of PD."

The mortality in our facility was approximately 50% and occurred in the later phase of the initial infection. In the nursing home setting, there were no approved treatment regimes. Specific treatment was left to the treating physician in concert with the administrative medical officials; immunizations were approved in December 2020. Concurrent publications indicated that epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and humic/fulvic acid with vitamin C possess the ability to interfere with the SARS-CoV-2 virus; both can inhibit viral attachment and reproduction, along with providing significant anti-inflammatory activity. They also exhibit good safety profiles and were previously utilized in our facility. With the high mortality and significant published data on inhibitory aspects of EGCG, humic/fulvic acid, and vitamin C, our facility utilized these supplements to treat COVID-19-positive patients. METHODS: This retrospective chart review analyzes the effectiveness of an integrative treatment consisting of EGCG and humic/fulvic acid with vitamin C provided to COVID-19 patients in a long-term care facility between October and December 2020. Nursing home patients with COVID-19 infections were either provided integrative treatment utilizing EGCG, humic/fulvic acid, and vitamin C or provided care without integrative support. All EGCG patients were informed, and, when needed, the first line of authority, power of attorney (POA) was contacted and informed that the integrative approach was not standard treatment (but was reviewed and approved by Pulaski Health and Rehabilitation Medical Facility directors and the patient's physician). Patients were informed of the safety literature and compounds' utilization in viral infections prior to accepting treatment. RESULTS: A review of 60 records indicates that among 22 patients receiving treatment with the integrative combination, there were no mortalities. Among 38 patients treated without this integrative support, there were 21 deaths.  Conclusions: In a retrospective review of the treatment data, treatment of COVID-19 in the nursing home setting with EGCG, humic/fulvic acid, and vitamin C resulted in a significant reduction in overall mortality."

For treating KCS associated keratopathy, the GEH NPs showed superior outcomes and consistently ranked among the strongest treatment options in most aspects evaluated, including reduced corneal irregularity, improved tear film stability, and lower fluorescein scores, indicating better corneal integrity. Additionally, the GEH group displayed the least inflammatory cell infiltration and maintained a healthier epithelial structure, further underscoring its protective effects. GEH was administered twice daily while other treatment groups were administrated 3 times daily, highlighting its efficacy even with a lower dosing frequency. The artificial tears demonstrated variable benefits on KCS led keratopathy across different evaluations. GEH NPs exhibited excellent protective effects and therapeutic potential on dry eye associated keratopathy based on this study.",

      "abstract": "Aurora Kinase B (AURKB) is crucial for chromosome alignment, segregation, and cytokinesis, phosphorylating essential proteins for accurate cell division. Mutations and overexpression of AURKB are common in various cancers. Inhibiting AURKB reduces therapy resistance, making it a promising therapeutic target. Synthetic inhibitors like AZD1152 and ZM447439 show selectivity for AURKB but often lack specificity due to high homology within the aurora kinase family. Conversely, natural molecules such as flavonoids offer selectivity, lower toxicity, and potential synergy with existing chemotherapies. Investigating natural AURKB inhibitors could lead to safer and more effective cancer treatments. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a catechin ester in green tea, inhibits glioma cell line proliferation by inducing spontaneous apoptosis and reduces cancer cell invasiveness by decreasing metalloproteinase, cytokine, and chemokine activities. Additionally, EGCG inhibits several kinases, including PI3K, mTOR, EGFR, and AKT, acting as an effective ATP-competitive inhibitor. Thus, EGCG may enhance the efficacy of anti-cancer therapies as an AURKB inhibitor. This study used in silico tools to predict EGCG's pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, and employed AutoDock for molecular docking with AURKB. The ligand-protein complex and Apo form of AURKB were simulated for 100 ns with GROMACS using the CHARM36 force field. Free energy surface analysis and MMPBSA methods confirmed the stability and spontaneity of EGCG binding to AURKB. The conformational dynamics of the DFG (Asp-Phe-Gly) motif in AURKB upon EGCG binding revealed significant changes crucial for ATP binding and kinase activity. The distance between the phenylalanine residue of the DFG motif and the αC helix in holo AURKB increased from 14.80 Å to 23.62 Å in the lowest free energy structure, indicating a shift from the DFG-in to the DFG-out state, affecting ATP binding. The study also noted transitions in the overall protein secondary structures, such as turn to coil, coil to sheet, and coil to helix, contributing to a stable structure upon EGCG binding. These findings highlight the complex interplay between EGCG and AURKB, providing insights into the conformational dynamics and structural alterations induced by this interaction, which has implications for reducing glioma cell chemosensitivity to therapeutic drugs.",

      "abstract": "Aging significantly affects intercellular communication between vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and hematopoietic cells, leading to vascular inflammation and age-associated diseases. This study determined how senescent ECs communicate with monocytes, whether extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from senescent ECs affect monocyte functions, and investigated the potential for epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a flavonoid in green tea, to reverse these effects. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with Etoposide (10 µM, 24 h) to induce senescence, followed by EGCG (100 µM, 24 h) treatment to evaluate its potential as a senotherapeutic agent. The interaction between ECs and monocytes was analyzed using a co-culture system and direct treatment of monocytes with EC-derived EVs. EGCG reduced senescence-associated phenotypes in ECs, as evidenced by decreased senescence-associated (SA)-β-Gal activity and reversal of Etoposide-induced senescence markers. Monocytes co-cultured with EGCG-treated senescent ECs showed decreased pro-inflammatory responses compared to those co-cultured with untreated senescent ECs. Additionally, senescent ECs produced more EVs than non-senescent ECs. EVs from senescent ECs enhanced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pro-inflammatory activation of monocytes, whereas EVs from EGCG-treated senescent ECs mitigated this activation, maintaining monocyte activation at normal levels. Our findings reveal that EGCG confers anti-senescent effects via modulation of the senescent EC secretome (including EVs) with the capacity to modify monocyte activation. These findings suggest that EGCG could act as a senotherapeutic agent to reduce vascular inflammation related to aging."

The connection between depression and gut microbiota is an emerging field of study in psychiatry and neuroscience. Understanding the gut-brain axis is pivotal for understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of depression. Gut microbes influence depression-like behaviors by impacting the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), monoamine neurotransmitters, immune responses, cell signaling, and metabolic pathways. Tea, widely used in clinical practice to improve neuropsychiatric disorders, contains Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a major ingredient of green tea, which effectively regulates intestinal flora. This review examined the risks and causes of depression, the complications associated with intestinal flora, their role in the development and treatment of depression, and how EGCG may alleviate depression through interactions with gut microbiota and other mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Tea is a significant source of flavonoids in the diet. Due to different production processes, the amount of bioactive compounds in unfermented (green) and (semi-)fermented tea differs. Importantly, green tea has a similar composition of phenolic compounds to fresh, unprocessed tea leaves. It consists primarily of monomeric flavan-3-ols, known as catechins, of which epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the most abundant. Thanks to its antioxidant, antiproliferative, and antiangiogenic properties, EGCG has attracted the scientific community's attention to its potential use in preventing and/or combating cancer. In this review article, we summarize the literature reports found in the Google Scholar and PubMed databases on the anticancer effect of EGCG on selected malignant neoplasms in women, i.e., breast, cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancers, which have been published over the last two decades. It needs to be emphasized that EGCG concentrations reported as effective against cancer cells are typically higher than those found in plasma after polyphenol administration. Moreover, the low bioavailability and absorption of EGCG appear to be the main reasons for the differences in the effects between in vitro and in vivo studies. In this context, we also decided to look at possible solutions to these problems, consisting of combining the polyphenol with other bioactive components or using nanotechnology. Despite the promising results of the studies conducted so far, mainly in vitro and on animal models, there is no doubt that further, broad-based activities are necessary to unequivocally assess the potential use of EGCG in oncological treatment to combat cancer in women.",

      "abstract": "The integration of nanotechnology into antiretroviral drug delivery systems presents a promising avenue to address challenges posed by long-term antiretroviral therapies (ARTs), including poor bioavailability, drug-induced toxicity, and resistance. These limitations impact the therapeutic effectiveness and quality of life for individuals living with HIV. Nanodrug delivery systems, particularly nanoemulsions, have demonstrated potential in improving drug solubility, enhancing bioavailability, and minimizing systemic toxicity. Moreover, nanodrug platforms can target viral reservoirs, potentially reducing the emergence of drug-resistant strains-a significant challenge in anti-HIV treatment. This study evaluates the biological efficacy of a rosemary oil-based nanoemulsion loaded with Nelfinavir (NFV) and Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG), which demonstrated HIV-1 suppression at sub-CC₅₀ concentrations across two distinct cellular systems. The synergistic interaction between NFV and EGCG was confirmed through cellular assays, enzymatic studies, and molecular interaction analysis. In vitro experiments revealed that the NE-NFV-EGCG nanoemulsion exhibited enhanced HIV-1 inhibitory activity compared to pure NFV, highlighting a promising therapeutic synergy. The findings suggest that EGCG could be a valuable adjunct in NFV-based regimens for HIV management. Molecular interaction studies further confirmed the nanoemulsion's inhibitory potential against the HIV-1 protease enzyme. This study marks a significant advancement in HIV-1 treatment by documenting, for the first time, the synergistic inhibitory activity of NFV and EGCG. The novel nanoformulation offers improved oral bioavailability, minimal side effects, and enhanced therapeutic outcomes. Future studies are needed to optimize the formulation for clinical applications, including sustained drug release and drug transport mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In this study, the potential effects are evaluated of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on the prognosis of diabetes and insulin resistance. METHODS: In an experiment, 35 male Wistar albino rats were used and in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats, the effects were examined of different doses (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg) of EGCG on metabolic parameters associated with diabetes and insulin resistance. RESULTS: The findings show favorable effects of EGCG on fasting blood glucose levels, insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and beta cell function. In this study, it was observed that EGCG was able to significantly lower fasting blood glucose levels, especially at high doses (200 mg/kg), providing the most significant improvement. Furthermore, EGCG has been found to reduce insulin resistance and improve insulin sensitivity by increasing insulin secretion. When the biochemical parameters of increased insulin secretion are evaluated, it is also observed that it creates clinically significant changes. At doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, EGCG has the potential to help control diabetes by most effectively improving insulin resistance and beta cell function. The study results suggest that EGCG, especially at high doses, is an effective component in the treatment of diabetes and the management of insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of EGCG as a natural flavonoid in medical nutrition therapy may contribute to glycemic control and improve insulin sensitivity in individuals with diabetes. These findings suggest that EGCG may be used as an alternative option in the treatment of diabetes and future studies may further clarify the potential benefits in this area.",

      "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, especially Escherichia coli, are a major contributor to healthcare-associated infections globally, posing significant treatment challenges. This study explores the efficacy of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a natural constituent of green tea, in combination with ampicillin (AMP) to restore the effectiveness of AMP against 40 isolated MDR E. coli strains. Antimicrobial activity assays were conducted to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of EGCG using the standard microdilution technique. Checkerboard assays were employed to assess the potential synergistic effects of EGCG combined with AMP. The pharmacodynamic effects of the combination were evaluated through time-kill assays. Outer membrane disruption was analyzed by measuring DNA and protein leakage and with assessments using N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (NPN) and rhodamine 123 (Rh123) fluorescence dyes. Biofilm eradication studies involved biofilm formation assays and preformed biofilm biomass and viability assays. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine changes in cellular morphology. The results indicated that EGCG demonstrated activity against all isolates, with MICs ranging from 0.5 to 2 mg/mL, while AMP exhibited MIC values between 1.25 and 50 mg/mL. Importantly, the EGCG-AMP combination showed enhanced efficacy compared to either treatment alone, as indicated by a fractional inhibitory concentration index between 0.009 and 0.018. The most pronounced synergy was observed in 13 drug-resistant strains, where the MIC for EGCG dropped to 8 µg/mL (from 1 mg/mL alone) and that for AMP to 50 µg/mL (from 50 mg/mL alone), achieving a 125-fold and 1000-fold reduction, respectively. Time-kill assays revealed that the bactericidal effect of the EGCG-AMP combination occurred within 2 h. The mechanism of EGCG action includes the disruption of membrane permeability and biofilm eradication in a dose-dependent manner. SEM confirmed that the combination treatment consistently outperformed the individual treatments. This study underscores the potential of restoring AMP efficacy in combination with EGCG as a promising strategy for treating MDR E. coli infections."

      "abstract": "Cisplatin (CIS) is a broad-spectrum anticancer drug widely used in the clinic; however, one of its side effects is that it can cause intestinal damage such as loss of appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea in patients. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is one of the main active substances in green tea, which has the effects of antitumor multiple drug resistance, antioxidation, and antiinflammatory properties. The aim of this study was to explore the protective effect of EGCG on CIS-induced intestinal injury in rats. First, physiological indices and HE staining indicated that compared with the control group, the physiological state of rats in the CIS group was worse, and the intestinal tissue was damaged, especially the ileum. In contrast, pretreatment with EGCG (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg) effectively alleviated the intestinal damage induced by CIS, with the 40 mg/kg dose demonstrating the most substantial protective effect. Additionally, 40 mg/kg EGCG pretreatment mitigated CIS-induced morphological and ultrastructural damage to intestinal tissues, reduced bacterial translocation, and preserved the integrity of the intestinal barrier. This treatment also altered the abundance of 19 bacterial species, including Lactobacillus and Shigella, and influenced amino acid metabolism and 15 metabolic pathways, including vitamin B6 metabolism by 16S RNA and metabolome sequencing. Furthermore, the expression of proteins associated with autophagy and the NRF2/Keap1 signaling pathway was inhibited. Lastly, ML385 (NRF2 signaling pathway inhibitor) reversed the protective effects of EGCG. Taken together, our findings indicate that EGCG ameliorates CIS induced hepatoenteric toxicity in rats by regulating the intestinal flora and targeting the Nrf2/Keap1 signal axis.",

At 46 h, the biofilm of the EGCG-treatment group failed to form the bacterial-EPS superstructures which is characteristic of the biofilm in the negative control group.

      "abstract": "Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), an important active component extracted from green tea, has attracted much attention due to its multiple biological activities such as antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor effects. Meanwhile, metformin (Met), a classic drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, exhibits additional benefits such as hypoglycemic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor effects. However, metformin often causes gastrointestinal reactions when used alone, affecting patients' quality of life. In view of this, we proposed an innovative technique for the fabrication of a carrier-free, dual-loaded nanodrug, Met-EGCG nanoparticles (Met-EGCG NPs), via self-assembly. The method for preparing Met-EGCG NPs is simple, rapid and cost-effective. In addition, the carrier-free Met-EGCG NPs nanodrug inherits the strong antioxidant capacity, good biocompatibility and excellent aggregation-induced fluorescence effect of EGCG, and even offer significant advantages in enhancing drug solubility, stability, and bioavailability, while effectively reducing the occurrence of side effects. Moreover, this Met-EGCG NPs nanodrug exhibits a synergistic therapeutic effect of EGCG and metformin, thereby significantly enhancing overall therapeutic efficacy, and demonstrates excellent potential in anti-cancer applications. This study not only successfully prepared Met-EGCG NPs but also experimentally verified their superior performance, opening a new path for the application of EGCG in drug therapy. This carrier-free, dual-loaded drug delivery nanosystem based on Met-EGCG NPs offers potential for drug combination therapy, promising to play a more critical role in the biomedical field and providing new insights and guidance for the development of future multidrug delivery systems.",

Current interventions continue to lack the ability to successfully enhance these conditions, therefore, it is crucial to consider alternative effective strategies. Currently, we investigated the effects of fibrin scaffold encapsulated with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) microspheres in the recovery of SCI in rats. A total of sixty mature male Sprague-Dawley rats were separated into four groups of the same size: TSCI, fibrin, EGCG, and Fibrin+EGCG. Samples of tissue were gathered at the location of the injury for additional examination. The treatment groups showed significantly higher levels of neurons, antioxidative biomarkers (T-AOC: total antioxidant capacity, GSH: glutathione, and SOD: superoxide dismutase), neurofilament light polypeptide (NEFL) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) genes, and neurological function scores compared to the TSCI group, with the Fibrin+EGCG group displaying the most noticeable improvements. Throughout the treatment process, there was a notable reduction in the amounts of apoptotic and glial cells, as well as levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and proinflammatory genes (TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL-1β: interleukin-1 beta), especially in the Fibrin+EGCG group compared to the TSCI group. Our findings suggest that EGCG enclosed in microspheres could enhance the prevention of injury spreading and the enhancement of pathological and behavioral symptoms when delivered to the location of spinal cord injury using a fibrin scaffold.",

Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity changes are commonly used to evaluate melanosis in aquatic products. In this study, we examined the interactions between epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and PPO. Further, we investigated whether treatment with EGCG in combination with ice glazing could restrict melanosis in E. sinensis during frozen storage and maintain its quality. The results demonstrated that EGCG inhibited PPO activity in a dose-dependent manner and firmly binds to the active pocket of PPO, thereby altering its tertiary structure. The melanosis and oxidation of E. sinensis in frozen storage were significantly reduced by adding 0.1 g/L EGCG combined with ice-glazing treatment (EGCG + IG). EGCG + IG improved the melanosis score of E. sinensis after six-week storage by 77.17%, and reduced protein and lipid oxidation by 10.80% and 62.46%, respectively, compared with untreated specimens. Moreover, the umami and sweet amino acids were better retained. Among the combined treatments, ice glazing effectively inhibited oxidation, whereas EGCG significantly inhibited melanosis. In summary, EGCG combine with ice glazing, is an effective way to maintain the quality of frozen E. sinensis and could also be studied to store other aquatic products.",

However, traditional medications for repairing skin photoaging cause side effects. Natural bioactive compounds have been shown to prevent and treat skin photoaging with fewer side effects. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the main substance in tea polyphenols, is a natural bioactive compound with a range of properties. This review summarizes the beneficial effects and mechanisms of EGCG, as well as the application forms of EGCG in repairing photoaged skin. Results indicated that EGCG has repair effects, including improving elasticity, enhancing moisturization, inhibiting damage, and reducing pigmentation of photoaged skin. It has also been demonstrated that EGCG delivery systems, modified EGCG, and combinations with other bioactive substances could be used for repairing photoaged skin due to its poor stability and low bioavailability. EGCG effectively repairs various types of skin damage caused by UV radiation while maintaining normal skin structure and function. It is, therefore, an effective candidate for repairing photoaged skin. These results could provide references for the development and application of EGCG products for the treatment of photoaged skin.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of obesity has increased progressively worldwide. Obesity is characterized by excessive accumulation of fat in adipose tissues, leading to metabolic impairment. The anti-obese effects of chitooligosaccharide (COS) and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) have been extensively clarified. This study aimed to investigate the effects and potential mechanisms of the COS-EGCG conjugate (CE) on anti-obesity, specifically by alleviating lipid accumulation and promoting the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) in obese rats. Obesity as a consequence of a high-fat diet (HFD) was induced in male Wistar rats. The HFD was given for 16 weeks and the rats were then randomly subdivided into five groups namely: vehicle (control group), HFD plus CE at 150 mg/kg/day, HFD plus CE at 600 mg/kg/day, HFD plus COS at 600 mg/kg/day, and HFD plus atorvastatin at 10 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. CE could reduce body weight, improve serum lipid profiles, and promote lipid metabolism via activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in WAT and enhance the processes of WAT browning by activating sirtuin 1 (Sirt 1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC1-α), and uncoupling the protein 1 (UCP1) signaling pathway. CE reduced obesity and promoted WAT browning in HFD-fed rats. Therefore, CE might be a new therapy for metabolic syndrome and obesity.",

This metabolic shift wherein the tumor cells employ aerobic glycolysis regardless of oxygen availability via reprogramming of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is known as the Warburg effect. Previous literatures have linked this metabolic reprograming to tumor progression and glioblastoma cell proliferation making it a key target for targeted drug therapy. Based on this lacuna, the current study aimed to explore the therapeutic efficacy of the triple-drug combination of temozolomide, metformin and epigallocatechin gallate in attenuating Warburg effect and glucose uptake in glioblastoma both in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that the triple-drug combination had significantly reduced glucose uptake and reversed the Warburg effect in glioblastoma cells and in the glioma-induced xenograft rat model. Thus, the triple-drug combination would serve as an effective therapeutic regime to hamper glioblastoma progression via altering glucose metabolism and improving the overall prognosis in patient setting.",

Kuntze, the most popular and frequently consumed product using a natural beverage worldwide. Some kinds of tea products, such as green tea, black tea, and oolong tea, have assorted flavors depending on the manufacturing techniques. Green tea has been studied for many years for its important beneficial effects, including anticancer, anti-obesity, anti-diabetes, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and cardiovascular effects. These effects are primarily associated with tea polyphenols, and regular consumption has been re-ported to decrease the incidence of some chronic diseases. Current studies support that green tea catechins play an important role in healing and improving the pathology of many diseases. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the most a highly found polyphenol in the leaves and is of great interest for its protective role in the prevention of diseases. Therefore, this review presents the efficacy and possible mechanisms of EGCG against sexually transmitted viruses. Moreover, EGCG and its derivatives are recognized as safe bioactive phytochemicals for external and internal use in preventing and treating viral STIs and other concurrent infections. Multidisciplinary studies are essential to discover cheaper, safer, and more effective treat-ments using EGCG and its derivatives to improve the toxicity and formulations of viral STI medications."

      "abstract": "The utilization of nanoformulations derived from natural products for the treatment of many human diseases, including cancer, is a rapidly developing field. Conventional therapies used for cancer treatment have limited efficacy and a greater number of adverse effects. Hence, it is imperative to develop innovative anticancer drugs with superior effectiveness. Among the diverse array of natural anticancer compounds, resveratrol, curcumin, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) have gained considerable attention in recent years. Despite their strong anticancer properties, medicinally significant phytochemicals such as resveratrol, curcumin, and EGCG have certain disadvantages, such as limited solubility in water, stability, and bioavailability problems. Encapsulating these phytochemicals in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), a polymer that is nontoxic, biodegradable, and biocompatible, is an effective method for delivering medication to the tumor location. In addition, PLGA nanoparticles can be modified with targeting molecules to specifically target cancer cells, thereby improving the effectiveness of phytochemicals in fighting tumors. Combining plant-based medicine (phytotherapy) with nanotechnology in a clinical environment has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of drugs and improve the overall health outcomes of patients. Therefore, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the different aspects and recent advancements in using PLGA-based nanocarriers for delivering anticancer phytochemicals. This review addresses the most recent advancements in PLGA-based delivery systems for resveratrol, EGCG, and curcumin, emphasizing the possibility of resolving issues related to the therapeutic efficacy and bioavailability of these compounds.",

Flavonoids, a diverse group of naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds abundant in fruits, vegetables, and other plant sources, have received considerable attention for their potential anticancer properties. This review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the current scientific literature on five specific natural flavonoids, namely quercetin, Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG), kaempferol, apigenin, and curcumin that have been widely reported in numerous carcinomas and evaluate their effectiveness and mechanisms in fighting different types of cancer. Known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, quercetin has shown promise in inhibiting cancer cells and modulating key signaling pathways. EGCG, a prominent catechin found in green tea, has been extensively studied for its ability to induce apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis, highlighting its potential as an anticancer agent. Kaempferol has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and has shown anticancer potential by modulating cellular processes involved in tumor development. Apigenin, abundant in parsley and chamomile, has been shown to exert anticancer properties by interrupting the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Curcumin has shown several anticancer effects, including inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and modulating inflammatory pathways. Despite these promising findings, it is essential to recognize the complexity of cancer biology and the need for further research to clarify the precise mechanisms of action of these natural flavonoids and optimize their therapeutic applications. Furthermore, understanding flavonoids' potential synergy and interactions with traditional cancer therapies is paramount for developing effective combinatorial strategies. This review thus aimed to summarize the current knowledge on these natural flavonoids and provide insight into their potential role as an adjunctive or stand-alone therapy in the fight against breast, prostate, colon, lung, skin, ovarian, liver, and pancreatic cancer."

The challenge lies in NFV's low intrinsic dissolution rate, significant p-gp efflux, and high hepatic metabolism, necessitating frequent and high-dose administration. Our objective was to develop a nanoemulsion loaded with NFV and EGCG to enhance oral delivery, expediting antiretroviral effects for NeuroAIDS treatment. After meticulous excipient screening, we selected Tween 40 as the surfactant and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) as the co-surfactant. Employing a Quality by Design (QbD) approach with statistical multivariate methods, we optimized the nanoemulsion that exhibited a droplet size of 83.21 nm, polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.289, transmittance of 95.20 %, zeta potential of 1.495 mV, pH of 6.95, refractive index of 1.40, viscosity of 24.00 ± 0.42 mPas, and conductivity of 0.162 μS/cm. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated superior in vivo absorption of the optimized nanoemulsion compared to NFV and EGCG suspension. The optimized nanoemulsion showcased higher Cmax of NFV (9.75 ± 1.23 μg/mL) and EGCG (27.7 ± 1.22 μg/mL) in the brain, along with NFV (26.44 ± 1.44 μg/mL) and EGCG (313.20 ± 5.53 μg/mL) in the plasma. This study advocates for the potential of NFV and EGCG-loaded nanoemulsion in combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for effective NeuroAIDS management."

In a double-blind, randomized controlled trial, obese subjects (n = 30) were randomly allocated to receive 150 mg EGCG (n = 15) or placebo (n = 15) twice a day without dietary restrictions. After 8-week EGCG treatment, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) significantly decreased, while the low-frequency (LF) to high-frequency power (HF) ratio (LF/HF ratio) significantly increased (P < 0.05 all), indicating a shift toward sympathetic dominance, either directly or indirectly after BP lowering. SBP had positive correlations with obesity parameters, leptin, insulin, and insulin resistance but had a negative correlation with insulin sensitivity. DBP was positively correlated with age and HF in normalized unit, but negatively correlated with height and LF in ms2. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was negatively correlated with SBP, DBP, and MAP reflecting its protective effect against elevated BP. In conclusion, the 8-week EGCG treatment decreased BP and increased the LF/HF ratio, reflecting increased sympathetic activity, either a direct EGCG effect or an indirect compensatory response following BP reduction.",

      "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) treats nonmelanoma skin cancer. PDT kills cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated by interaction among cellular O2, photosensitizer and specific light. Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) is a photosensitizer produced from methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) by heme group synthesis (HGS) pathway. In PDT-resistant cells, PDT efficacy has been improved by addition of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Therefore, the aim of this work is to evaluate the effect of EGCG properties over MAL-TFD and PpIX production on A-431 cell line. EGCG's role over cell proliferation (flow cytometry and wound healing assay) and clonogenic capability (clonogenic assay) was evaluated in A-431 cell line, while the effect of EGCG over MAL-PDT was determined by cell viability assay (MTT), PpIX and ROS detection (flow cytometry), intracellular iron quantification and gene expression of HGS enzymes (RT-qPCR). Low concentrations of EGCG (<50 µM) did not have an antiproliferative effect over A-431 cells; however, EGCG inhibited clonogenic cell capability. Furthermore, EGCG (<50 µM) improved MAL-PDT cytotoxicity, increasing PpIX and ROS levels, exerting a positive influence on PpIX synthesis, decreasing intracellular iron concentration and modifying HGS enzyme gene expression such as PGB (upregulated) and FECH (downregulated). EGCG inhibits clonogenic capability and modulates PpIX synthesis, enhancing PDT efficacy in resistant cells.",

Treatment with EGCG effectively attenuated lipid deposition by downregulating lipid synthesis-related genes. Moreover, EGCG mitigated oxidative stress, inflammation, DNA damage, and apoptosis induced by OA, thereby preserving hepatocyte viability.

      "abstract": "Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)-based nanosystems have garnered significant attention for their ability to alleviate inflammation due to their excellent anti-inflammatory properties and enhanced drug delivery capabilities. However, the degradation of EGCG in strongly acidic environments poses a challenge for potential administration, particularly in oral formulations, where gastric resistance is essential. In this study, we develop a \"disintegration and reorganization\" strategy to create acid-resistant antioxidant nanoparticles (EGA NPs) based on EGCG and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) for mitigating inflammation in colitis and acute kidney injury. At acidic pH, the ester bond in EGCG breaks down, producing two building blocks. These, together with 5-ASA and formaldehyde, form oligomers through a combination of phenol-aldehyde condensation and the Mannich reaction. The resulting oligomers self-assemble into EGA NPs, which exhibit significant stability under both acidic and neutral pH conditions. This stability makes them suitable for oral administration, allowing them to withstand harsh gastric conditions, as well as for intravenous injection. Importantly, these oligomers retain the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of EGCG, effectively scavenging reactive oxygen species and reducing intracellular oxidative stress. Additionally, EGA shows potential as a drug carrier, efficiently loading the anti-inflammatory agent curcumin (Cur) to form Cur@EGA NPs. In vivo studies demonstrate the efficacy of Cur@EGA and EGA in alleviating acute colitis and kidney injury following oral and intravenous administration, respectively. These nanoparticulate formulations exhibit superior inflammation reduction compared to free Cur in vivo. Overall, our findings introduce a novel acid-resistant nanoplatform based on EGCG for the treatment of acute inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy that has prompted investigations into new potential therapeutic avenues. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major component of green tea, confers antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor properties. Previous studies have shown that EGCG inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of multiple myeloma cells, however its underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we accordingly sought to examine the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of EGCG on MM. Initially, using CCK8 (Cell Counting Kit-8) assays and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, we demonstrated that EGCG dose-dependently reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in the MM cell lines MM.1S and RPMI 8226. Subsequently, mRNA sequencing of EGCG-treated MM.1S cells revealed a significant upregulation of genes associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), including P-eIF2α (phosphorylation-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha), ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4), CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein, DDIT3), and PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis, BBC3), which were confirmed at the protein level by western blotting. Furthermore, treatment with the eIF2α inhibitor ISRIB reduced the rates of EGCG-induced apoptosis and promoted increases in the protein expression of all four ER stress-related molecules in MM cells. Additionally, mRNA-seq data revealed a downregulation of α-Tubulin 1b (TUBA1B) expression in EGCG-treated MM cells, which was confirmed by western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses. Moreover, we utilized a mouse model to show that EGCG inhibited myeloma tumor growth, which was inhibited by ISRIB. In summary, the findings of this novel study indicated that EGCG promotes apoptosis of MM cells, both via activation of the ER stress pathway and disruption of cytoskeletal integrity. These findings highlight the multi-faceted anti-tumor effects of EGCG and its potential clinical application in MM treatment.",

      "abstract": "To explore the therapeutic effects along with the molecular mechanisms of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) treatment using network pharmacology as well as animal experiments. Firstly, the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Systems Pharmacology Database was searched to identify the potential targets of EGCG. The DisGeNET Database was used to screen the potential targets of NAFLD. The GeneCards Database was searched to identify related genes involved in pyroptosis. Subsequently, the intersecting genes of EGCG targeting pyroptosis to regulate NAFLD were obtained using a Venn diagram. Simultaneously, the aforementioned intersecting genes were used to construct a drug-disease target protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The DAVID database was adopted for Gene Ontology (GO) as well as Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. The main pathway-target network was determined. Next, the potential mechanism of EGCG targeting pyroptosis to regulate NAFLD was investigated and validated through in vivo experiments. 626 potential targets of EGCG, 447 target genes of NAFLD, and 568 potential targets of pyroptosis were identified. The number of common targets between EGCG, NAFLD, and pyroptosis was 266. GO biological process items and 92 KEGG pathways were determined based on the analysis results. Animal experiments demonstrated that EGCG could ameliorate body weight, glucolipid metabolism, steatosis, and liver injury, enhance insulin sensitivity, and improve glucose tolerance in NAFLD mice through the classical pathway of pyroptosis. EGCG could effectively treat NAFLD through multiple targets and pathways. It was concluded that EGCG ameliorates hepatocyte steatosis, pyroptosis, dyslipidemia, and inflammation in NAFLD mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD), and the protective mechanism could be associated with the NLRP3-Caspase-1-GSDMD classical pyroptosis pathway.",

Plant-active ingredients may play a key role in glycemic control. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a characteristic catechin derived from tea that possesses anti-diabetic properties. Nonetheless, its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Herein, the protective role of EGCG on high glucose (33 mM)-induced pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and its possible molecular mechanisms were investigated. Briefly, MIN6 cells were treated with glucose and EGCG (10 µM, 20 µM, and 40 µM) for 48 h. Our results revealed that EGCG dose-dependently restored mitochondrial membrane potential and concomitantly alleviated cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, the expression level of apoptotic protein BAX and Dynamic related protein 1 (DRP1) was significantly downregulated following EGCG treatment, whereas that of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 was significantly upregulated. Taken together, EGCG alleviated high glucose-induced pancreatic beta cell dysfunction by targeting the DRP1-related mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and thus can serve as a nutritional intervention for the preservation of beta cell dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Human epidemiological studies have shown that diets rich in plant polyphenols have beneficial effects on various diseases including cancer. Epigallocatechin Gallate, a flavonoid polyphenol molecule, has been shown to be both chemotherapeutic and chemo-preventive in the treatment of several forms of cancer, including lung cancer. 80% of cancers of the lungs are non-small cell lung cancers. OBJECTIVE: The study was carried out to see the effects of Epigallocatechin Gallate in non-small cell lung cancer cells (A549) using in-vitro studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell Viability Assay was performed using MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. Wound Healing assay was also performed at different concentrations of the compound. Dexamethasone and Doxorubicin, the drugs with anti-cancer properties served as control. A549 cell lines were used. RESULTS: In the current study, it was demonstrated using Cell viability assay and Wound Healing assay that Epigallocatechin gallate exhibits anti-proliferative activity on A549 lung cancer cells and inhibits cancer cell proliferation in a concentration and time-dependent manner. It was observed that Epigallocatechin gallate (P = 0.0016, P = 0.0018) could significantly inhibit the growth of lung cancer cells with IC50 values 60.55 ± 1.0 μM. The result of wound Healing assay suggests that Epigallocatechin gallate can inhibit the proliferation and migration of A549 cells with concentrations near or higher to 50 μM. CONCLUSION: Epigallocatechin gallate's protective effect has been shown in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells in a time and dose-dependent manner. This suggests the implication of Epigallocatechin gallate for the prevention and therapy for lung cancer."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The emergence of drug resistance to oxaliplatin (OXA) is one of the critical obstacles in the therapy of advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). As an ethyl derivative of the natural compound epigallocatechin gallate (epigallocatechin-3-gallate, EGCG), Y6 was found to be able to enhance the sensitivity of HCC cells to doxorubicin. This study aimed to investigate the effect of Y6 on oxaliplatin resistance in HCC. METHODS: MTT was used to determine the reversal effect of Y6 on OXA resistance. To further explore the reversal mechanism, we treated OXA alone or in combination with Y6 or EGCG in drugresistant cells and observed the morphological changes of the cells. At the same time, transwell assay was used to detect the invasion and migration ability of cells. Moreover, Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were performed to determine the expression levels of the miR-338-3p gene, HIF-1α/Twist proteins, and EMT-related proteins. RESULTS: We found that Y6 could inhibit the proliferation of HCC cells and effectively reverse the drug resistance of oxaliplatin-resistant human liver cancer cells (SMMC-7721/OXA) to OXA, and the reversal effect was more significant than that of its lead drug EGCG. Most of the cells in the control group and OXA group showed typical mesenchymal-like cell morphology, while most of the cells in co-administration groups showed typical epithelioid cell morphology, and the ability of the cells to invade and migrate decreased dramatically, particularly in Y6 plus OXA group. At the same time, Y6 could up-regulate the EMT epithelial marker protein E-cadherin and down-regulate the interstitial marker protein Vimentin. In addition, in co-administration groups, the expression of miR-338-3p was up-regulated, while the expression of HIF-1α and Twist was down-regulated. CONCLUSION: Y6 significantly enhanced the susceptibility of drug-resistant cells to OXA, and the process may be related to the regulation of miR-338-3p/HIF-1α / TWIST pathway to inhibit EMT. Therefore, Y6 could be considered an effective medication resistance reversal agent, which could improve the therapeutic effect for hepatocellular cancer patients."

      "abstract": "Enhancing the hydrophilicity and UV protective property of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabric are two significant ways to upgrade its quality and enlarge the applicable area. Biobased finishes are greatly welcomed for the fabrication of sustainable textiles; however, their application on PET fabric is still challenging compared with the case of natural fabric. This study presents a strategy that immobilizes epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) onto PET fabric using citric acid (CA) for durably hydrophilic and UV-proof properties with negligible color change. A controllable surface-activating method integrating alkaline and deep eutectic solvent (DES) is customized for the PET fabric to promote the reactions among PET, CA, and EGCG. The hydrophilic, antistatic, and UV protective properties of functionalized PET fabric were explored. Results show that the hydrophilicity of the PET fabric after direct EGCG treatment increases but drops sharply after first-round washing due to weak interactions. The combined alkaline/DES pretreatment increases the number of hydrophilic groups and the roughness of PET fibers. After EGCG modification, the moisture regain (MR) of PET fabric increases from 0.41 to 0.64%. The contact angle and electrostatic charge half-life (T1/2) decreases from >120 to 23°, and from >60 to 0.13 s, respectively. The MR and T1/2 are well retained after a 10-cycle washing. In addition, the UV protective factor of the PET fabric increases from 18 to 36. A very slight yellowing phenomenon occurs on the PET fabric after the treatment. In all, this research attempts to integrate a biobased finishing agent and an eco-friendly cross-linker on synthetic fiber for durable functions, which is transferrable to the sustainable fabrication of other polymeric materials such as fibers or films.",

      "abstract": "The protein Bcl-2, well-known for its anti-apoptotic properties, has been implicated in cancer pathogenesis. Identifying the primary gene responsible for promoting improved cell survival and development has provided compelling evidence for preventing cellular death in the progression of malignancies. Numerous research studies have provided evidence that the abundance of Bcl-2 is higher in malignant cells, suggesting that suppressing Bcl-2 expression could be a viable therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. In this study, we acquired a compound collection using a database that includes constituents from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Initially, we established a pharmacophore model and utilized it to search the TCM database for potential compounds. Compounds with a fitness score exceeding 0.75 were selected for further analysis. The Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) analysis identified six compounds with favorable therapeutic characteristics. The compounds that successfully passed the initial screening process based on the pharmacodynamic model were subjected to further evaluation. Extra-precision (XP) docking was employed to identify the compounds with the most favorable XP docking scores. Further analysis using the Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) method to calculate the overall free binding energy. The binding energy between the prospective ligand molecule and the target protein Bcl-2 was assessed by a 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation for curcumin and Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). The findings of this investigation demonstrate the identification of a molecular structure that effectively inhibits the functionality of the Bcl-2 when bound to the ligand EGCG. Consequently, this finding presents a novel avenue for the development of pharmaceuticals capable of effectively addressing both inflammatory and tumorous conditions.",

However, pure HA hydrogels alone do not provide sufficient protection against potential inflammatory risks following vitrectomy. In this study, HA was crosslinked with 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE) to form HA hydrogels (HB). Subsequently, the anti-inflammatory agent epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was added to the hydrogel (HBE) for ophthalmic applications as a vitreous substitute. The characterization results indicated the successful preparation of HB with transparency, refractive index, and osmolality similar to those of native vitreous humor, and with good injectability. The anti-inflammatory ability of HBE was also confirmed by the reduced expression of inflammatory genes in retinal pigment epithelial cells treated with HBE compared with those treated with HB. In a New Zealand white rabbit model undergoing vitreous substitution treatment, HBE 50 (EGCG 50 μM addition) exhibited positive results at 28 days post-surgery. These outcomes included restored intraocular pressure, improved electroretinogram responses, minimal increase in corneal thickness, and no inflammation during histological examination. This study demonstrated the potential of an injectable HA-BDDE cross-linked hydrogel containing EGCG as a vitreous substitute for vitrectomy applications, offering prolonged degradation time and anti-inflammatory effects postoperatively.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as the most prevalent glocal cause of chronic hepatic disease, with incidence rates that continue to rise steadily. Treatment options for affected patients are currently limited to dietary changes and exercise interventions, with no drugs having been licensed for the treatment of this disease. There is thus a pressing need for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Work from our group suggests that the primary bioactive ingredient in green tea, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), may help reduce liver fat content and protect against hepatic injury through the inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) expression and activity. The study investigated the potential pathways by which EGCG may improve NAFLD, identified the sites of interaction between EGCG and DPP4, and proposed novel clinical treatment strategies. METHODS: A clinical randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate the potential efficacy of EGCG in NAFLD patients. The study compared relevant indices before and after EGCG administration. Animal models of NAFLD were constructed using male C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet to observe the ameliorative effects of EGCG on the livers of the model mice and to investigate the potential pathways by which EGCG alleviates NAFLD. The interaction mechanism between EGCG and DPP4 was investigated using oleic acid and palmitic acid-treated HepG2 cell lines. Plasmids in which different sites had been disrupted were used to identify the effective interaction sites. RESULTS: ECGC was found to suppress the accumulation of lipids, inhibit inflammation, remediate dysregulated lipid metabolism, and improve the pathogenesis of NAFLD via the inhibition of the expression and activity of DPP4. CONCLUSIONS: The study results indicate that EGCG has a positive impact on improving NAFLD. These results highlight promising new opportunities to safely and effectively treat NAFLD in the clinic.

      "abstract": "Walnut isolate protein (WPI)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) conjugates can be employed to creat food-grade delivery systems for preserving bioactive compounds. In this study, WPI-EGCG nanoparticles (WENPs) were developed for encapsulating lycopene (LYC) using the ultrasound-assisted method. The results indicated successful loading of LYC into these WENPs, forming the WENPs/LYC (cylinder with 200-300 nm in length and 14.81-30.05 nm in diameter). Encapsulating LYC in WENPs led to a notable decrease in release rate and improved stability in terms of thermal, ultraviolet (UV), and storage conditions compared to free LYC. Simultaneously, WENPs/LYC exhibited a synergistic and significantly higher antioxidant activity with an EC50 value of 23.98 μg/mL in HepG2 cells compared to free LYC's 31.54 μg/mL. Treatment with WENPs/LYC led to a dose-dependent restoration of intracellular antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px) and inhibition of intracellular malondialdehyde (MDA) formation. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis indicated that enrichment in glutathione metabolism and peroxisome processes following WENPs/LYC addition. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) verified the expression levels of related genes involved in the antioxidant resistance pathway of WENPs/LYC on AAPH-induced oxidative stress. This study offers novel perspectives into the antioxidant resistance pathway of WENPs/LYC, holding significant potential in food industry.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can lead to alcoholic fatty liver, posing substantial health risks. l-Theanine (LTA) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in tea exert antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects. However, the combined effects of LTA and EGCG on rats with alcoholic fatty liver, and the underlying mechanisms of such effects, remain unclear. In this study, Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were fed with alcohol for 6 weeks to induce alcoholic fatty liver. Subsequently, for another 6 weeks, the rats were administered LTA (200 mg kg-1 day-1), EGCG (200 mg kg-1 day-1), or a combination of LTA with EGCG (40 mg kg-1 day-1 l-Thea +160 mg kg-1 day-1 EGCG), respectively. RESULTS: The combined use of LTA and EGCG for alcoholic fatty liver disease had more significant effects than their individual administration. This combination reduced the activity of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as well as the levels of hepatic triglyceride (TG), malondialdehyde (MDA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the rats. The combined intervention also increased hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase activity. Reductions in hepatic fat accumulation and inflammatory responses were observed. The mechanism underlying these effects primarily involved the inhibition of fatty acid synthesis and the alleviation of lipid peroxidation through the downregulation of the mRNA and protein expression of TNF-α, SREBP1c, and CYP2E1 and the upregulation of the mRNA and protein expression of ADH1, ALDH2, Lipin-1, PPARαPPARα, AMPK, and PGC-1α, thereby promoting the oxidative decomposition of fatty acids and reducing the synthesis of cholesterol and glucose. CONCLUSION: l-Theanine and EGCG appear to be able to alleviate alcoholic fatty liver by modulating lipid metabolism and ameliorating oxidative stress, indicating their potential as natural active ingredients in anti-alcoholic fatty liver food products. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent regulated cell death mechanism, holds significant promise as a therapeutic strategy in oncology. In the current study, we explored the regulatory effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a prominent polyphenol in green tea, on ferroptosis and its potential therapeutic implications for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Treatment of NSCLC cell lines with varying concentrations of EGCG resulted in a notable suppression of cell proliferation, as evidenced by a reduction in Ki67 immunofluorescence staining. Western blot analyses demonstrated that EGCG treatment led to a decrease in the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) while increasing the levels of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4). These molecular changes were accompanied by an increase in intracellular iron, malondialdehyde (MDA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS), alongside ultrastructural alterations characteristic of ferroptosis. Through small RNA sequencing and RT-qPCR, transfer RNA-derived small RNA 13502 (tsRNA-13502) was identified as a significant target of EGCG action, with its expression being upregulated in NSCLC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumorous tissues. EGCG was found to modulate the ferroptosis pathway by downregulating tsRNA-13502 and altering the expression of key ferroptosis regulators (GPX4/SLC7A11 and ACSL4), thereby promoting the accumulation of iron, MDA, and ROS, and ultimately inducing ferroptosis in NSCLC cells. This study elucidates EGCG's multifaceted mechanisms of action, underscoring the modulation of ferroptosis as a viable therapeutic approach for enhancing NSCLC treatment outcomes."

We explore the effect and potential regulatory mechanisms of EGCG in preeclampsia (PE)-like rats. METHODS AND MATERIALS: PE was mimicked in pregnant rats. EGCG was orally administered at a dosage of 25(Low, L) or 50 mg/kg (High, H) from gestational day (GD) 6-17. The blood pressure signatures, heart rates were monitored. The 24-h proteinuria and serum were analyzed. On GD 18, rats were sacrificed, and pups and placentas were weighed. Kidneys and placentas were analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and hematoxylin-eosin staining (H&E). Placentas were examined using western blot for sFlt1, eNOS, Nrf2, HO-1, SLC7A11. MDA, GSH, GPx and Fe2+ were measured. RESULTS: EGCG inhibits systolic blood pressure, BUN, CREA, ALT, AST, UA and proteinuria levels in PE-like rats. EGCG enhances the pup weight and crown-rump length and reduces the rate of fetus growth restriction in PE group. Endothelial dysfunction and infiltration of inflammatory cells were found in kidney cortex and placenta tissues in PE group and were inhibited by EGCG treatment. sFlt1 was activated in placentas in PE group and inhibited by EGCG while eNOS/Nrf2/HO-1 were inhibited in PE group and restored by EGCG. MDA and Fe concentrations were elevated in PE group and reduced by EGCG while the GSH level, SLC7A11 and the GPx activity were inhibited in PE group and restored by EGCG. CONCLUSION: EGCG alleviates inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and placental ferroptosis, improves pregnancy outcomes in PE-like rats via eNOS/Nrf2/HO-1.",

However, the specific mechanism by which EGCG protects osteoblasts from cadmium-induced damage remains incompletely understood. Here, the action of EGCG was investigated by exposing MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts to EGCG and CdCl2 and examining their growth, apoptosis, and differentiation. It was found that EGCG promoted the viability of cadmium-exposed MC3T3-E1 cells, mitigated apoptosis, and promoted both maturation and mineralization. Additionally, CdCl2 has been reported to inhibit both the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1(Nrf2/HO-1) signaling pathways. EGCG treatment attenuated cadmium-induced apoptosis in osteoblasts and restored their function by upregulating both signaling pathways. The findings provide compelling evidence for EGCG's role in attenuating cadmium-induced osteoblast apoptosis and dysfunction through activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways. This suggests the potential of using EGCG for treating cadmium-induced osteoblast dysfunction.",

This study investigated the effect of partial gelatinization (PG) synergizing with polyphenol (epicatechin, EC; epigallocatechin gallate, EGCG) on the multi-scale structure and short/long-term retrogradation of corn starch (CS). The PG synergizing with EC/EGCG substantially suppressed the short/long-term retrogradation properties of CS. These could be confirmed by the decreased storage modulus and viscosity, the relative crystallinity (1.54%, 3.56%), and the retrogradation degree (9.99%, 20.18%) of CS during storage for 1, 14 days after PG synergizing with EGCG and EC, respectively. This is because PG treatment promoted the hydrogen bond interaction between disordered starch molecules and EC/EGCG. These were proven by the larger aggregation, more and brighter fluorescents, and the reduced long/short-range order structures in CS after PG synergizing with EC/EGCG. This study is helpful for the development of foods with enhanced nutrition and low-retrogradation.",

This work aimed to enhance oral bioavailability by forming gastric pH-stable shellac nanoparticles containing curcumin and epigallocatechin gallate using locust bean gum by anti-solvent precipitation (CESL-NP). The nanoparticles were characterized by their particle size, morphology, zeta potential, gastric pH stability, release profile, drug loading, and entrapment efficiency. The findings showed that a network of hydrolyzed shellac, locust bean gum, curcumin, and epigallocatechin gallate successfully entrapped individual particles inside a complex system. The morphological investigation of the CESL-NP formulation using FESEM, TEM, and AFM revealed the presence of spherical particles. FTIR, DSC, and XRD analysis revealed that curcumin and epigallocatechin gallate were amorphous due to their bond interactions with the matrix. Streptozotocin-treated mice, upon treatment with CESL-NP, showed kidney and pancreatic improvements with normalized kidney hypertrophy index and histopathology, maintained biochemical parameters, increased beta cell count, and a 38.68-fold higher blood glucose level inhibition were observed when compared to free-(CUR + EGCG). This research affirms that the shellac-locust bean gum complex shows potential for the sustained oral delivery of curcumin and epigallocatechin gallate, specifically for treating diabetic nephropathy.",

However, the effects of EGCG on the virulence of S. mutans biofilm development have yet to be fully investigated using validated cariogenic biofilm models. OBJECTIVE: Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of EGCG on S. mutans biofilm virulence using a validated cariogenic model and clinically relevant treatment regimens, twice a day for 1.5 min. METHODS: Effects of EGCG on bacterial viability, polyssacharide synthesis and biofilm acidogenesis were evaluated. The morphology and 3D structure of the biofilms were evaluated by scanning electron (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy, respectively. RESULTS: No significant change in S. mutans viability or culture medium pH were observed when comparing EGCG-treated and NaCl-treated biofilms. EGCG significantly reduced the accumulation of soluble and insoluble polysaccharides, resulting in the formation of a biofilm with interspaced exopolysaccharide-microcolony complexes unevenly distributed on enamel. The SEM images of the biofilm treated with EGCG depict multilayers of cells arranged in short chains of microorganisms adhered to an unstructured matrix, which is not continuous and does not enmesh or protect the microorganisms entirely. Importantly, confocal images demonstrated that treatment with EGCG affected the 3D structure and organization of S. mutans biofilm, which presented a biofilm matrix more confined to the location of the microcolonies. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, EGCG lowered the virulence of S. mutans matrix-rich biofilm by reducing the synthesis of biofilm matrix components, altering the biofilm matrix structure, organization, and distribution.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: Epidemiological evidence indicates that there is a substantial association between body mass index (BMI) and at least ten forms of cancer, including melanoma, and BMI imbalance contributes to the poor survival rate of cancer patients before and after therapy. Nevertheless, few pharmacological studies on models of obesity and cancer have been reported. In this study, we administered epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) to B16BL6 tumor-bearing mice that received a high-fat diet (HFD) to examine its impact. METHODS: B16BL6 tumor-bearing mice were fed a HFD. Body weight and food intake were documented every week. We conducted a Western blot analysis to examine the protein levels in the tumor, gastrocnemius (GAS), and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles, as well as the inguinal and epididymal white adipose tissues (iWAT and eWAT). KEY FINDINGS: EGCG has been shown to have anti-cancer effects equivalent to those of cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug. Furthermore, EGCG protected against the loss of epidydimal white adipose tissue by regulating protein levels of lipolysis factors of adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase as well as WAT browning factors of uncoupling protein 1, as opposed to cisplatin. EGCG was shown to reduce the protein levels of muscular atrophy factors of muscle RING-finger protein-1, whereas cisplatin did not contribute to rescuing the atrophy of TA and GAS muscles. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings indicate that EGCG has a preventive effect against cachexia symptoms and has anti-cancer effects similar to those of cisplatin in tumor-bearing mice fed a high-fat diet.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mitotic clonal expansion (MCE) is a prerequisite for preadipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) has been shown to inhibit preadipocyte differentiation. However, the exact molecular mechanisms are still elusive. PURPOSE: This study investigated whether EGCG could inhibit adipogenesis and lipid accumulation by regulating the cell cycle in the MCE phase of adipogenesis and its underlying molecular mechanisms. METHOD: 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate by a differentiation cocktail (DMI) and were treated with EGCG (25-100 μM) for 9, 18, and 24 h to examine the effect on MCE, or eight days to examine the effect on terminal differentiation. C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for three months to induce obesity and were given EGCG (50 or 100 mg/kg) daily by gavage. RESULTS: We showed that EGCG significantly inhibited terminal adipogenesis and lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells and decreased expressions of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and FASN. Notably, at the MCE phase, EGCG regulated the cell cycle in sequential order, induced G0/G1 arrest at 18 h, and inhibited the G2/M phase at 24 h upon DMI treatment. Meanwhile, EGCG regulated the expressions of cell cycle regulators (cyclin D1, cyclin E1, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin B1, cyclin B2, p16, and p27), and decreased C/EBPβ, PPARγ, and C/EBPα expressions at MCE. Mechanistic studies using STAT3 agonist Colivelin and antagonist C188-9 revealed that EGCG-induced cell cycle arrest in the MCE phase and terminal adipocyte differentiation was mediated by the inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling cascades and STAT3 (Tyr705) nuclear translocation. Furthermore, EGCG significantly protected mice from HFD-induced obesity, reduced body weight and lipid accumulations in adipose tissues, reduced hyperlipidemia and leptin levels, and improved glucose intolerance and insulin sensitivity. Moreover, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis showed that the cell cycle changes in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) were significantly enriched upon EGCG treatment. We further verified that EGCG treatment significantly reduced expressions of adipogenic factors, cell cycle regulators, and p-STAT3 in eWAT. CONCLUSION: EGCG inhibits MCE, resulting in the inhibition of early and terminal adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation, which were mediated by inhibiting p-STAT3 nucleus translocation and activation.",

      "abstract": "Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a polyphenolic component of green tea that has anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects in neurons. Ischemic stroke is a major neurological disease that causes irreversible brain disorders. It increases the intracellular calcium concentration and induces apoptosis. The regulation of intracellular calcium concentration is important to maintain the function of the nervous system. Hippocalcin is a neuronal calcium sensor protein that controls intracellular calcium concentration. We investigated whether EGCG treatment regulates the expression of hippocalcin in stroke animal model and glutamate-induced neuronal damage. We performed middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to induce cerebral ischemia. EGCG (50 mg/kg) or phosphate buffered saline was injected into the abdominal cavity just before MCAO surgery. The neurobehavioral tests were performed 24 h after MCAO surgery and cerebral cortex tissue was collected. MCAO damage induced severe neurobehavioral disorders, increased infarct volume, and decreased the expression of hippocalcin in the cerebral cortex. However, EGCG treatment improved these deficits and alleviated the decrease in hippocalcin expression in cerebral cortex. In addition, EGCG dose-dependently alleviated neuronal cell death and intracellular calcium overload in glutamate-exposed neurons. Glutamate exposure reduced hippocalcin expression, decreased Bcl-2 expression, and increased Bax expression. However, EGCG treatment mitigated these changes caused by glutamate toxicity. EGCG also attenuated the increase in caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 expressions caused by glutamate exposure. The effect of EGCG was more pronounced in non-transfected cells than in hippocalcin siRNA-transfected cells. These findings demonstrate that EGCG protects neurons against glutamate toxicity through the regulation of Bcl-2 family proteins and caspase-3. It is known that hippocalcin exerts anti-apoptotic effect through the modulation of apoptotic pathway. Thus, we can suggest evidence that EGCG has a neuroprotective effect by regulating hippocalcin expression in ischemic brain damage and glutamate-exposed cells.",

      "abstract": "Cancer, a disease that modern medicine has not fully understood and conquered, with its high incidence and mortality, deprives countless patients of health and even life. According to global cancer statistics, there were an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases and nearly 10 million cancer deaths in 2020, with the age-standardized incidence and mortality rates of 201.0 and 100.7 per 100,000, respectively. Although remarkable advancements have been made in therapeutic strategies recently, the overall prognosis of cancer patients remains not optimistic. Consequently, there are still many severe challenges to be faced and difficult problems to be solved in cancer therapy today. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a natural polyphenol extracted from tea leaves, has received much attention for its antitumor effects. Accumulating investigations have confirmed that EGCG can inhibit tumorigenesis and progression by triggering apoptosis, suppressing proliferation, invasion, and migration, altering tumor epigenetic modification, and overcoming chemotherapy resistance. Nevertheless, its regulatory roles and biomolecular mechanisms in the immune microenvironment, metabolic microenvironment, and immunotherapy remain obscure. In this article, we summarized the most recent updates about the effects of EGCG on tumor microenvironment (TME), metabolic reprogramming, and anti-cancer immunotherapy. The results demonstrated EGCG can promote the anti-cancer immune response of cytotoxic lymphocytes and dendritic cells (DCs), attenuate the immunosuppression of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), and inhibit the tumor-promoting functions of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), and various stromal cells including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells (ECs), stellate cells, and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). Additionally, EGCG can suppress multiple metabolic reprogramming pathways, including glucose uptake, aerobic glycolysis, glutamine metabolism, fatty acid anabolism, and nucleotide synthesis. Finally, EGCG, as an immunomodulator and immune checkpoint blockade, can enhance immunotherapeutic efficacy and may be a promising candidate for antitumor immunotherapy. In conclusion, EGCG plays versatile regulatory roles in TME and metabolic reprogramming, which provides novel insights and combined therapeutic strategies for cancer immunotherapy.",

Therefore, there are urgent needs to develop alternative antibacterial strategies without inducing significant resistance. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a promising alternative approach but usually faces limitations such as the need for stable and environmental-friendly PTT agents and ensuring biocompatibility with living tissues, necessitating ongoing research for its clinical advancement. Herein, in this study, with the aim to develop a green synthesized PTT agent for photothermal enhanced antibacterial and wound healing, we proposed a facile one-pot method to prepare epigallocatechin gallate-ferric (EGCG-Fe) complex nanoparticles. The obtained nanoparticles showed improved good size distribution and stability with high reproducibility. More importantly, EGCG-Fe complex nanoparticles have additional photothermal conversion ability which can give photothermal enhanced antibacterial effect on various pathogens, including Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains. EGCG-Fe complex nanoparticles also showed powerful biofilm prevention and destruction effects with promoted antibacterial and wound healing on mice model. In conclusion, EGCG-Fe complex nanoparticles can be a robust green material with effective and novel light controllable antibacterial properties for photothermal enhanced antibacterial and wound healing applications.",

      "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia carrying FMS-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 (FLT3) mutations is a fatal blood cancer with a poor prognosis. Although the FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib has recently been approved, it still suffers from limited efficacy and relatively high nonresponse rates. In this study, we report the potentiation of gilteritinib efficacy using nanocomplexation with a hyaluronic acid-epigallocatechin gallate conjugate. The self-assembly, colloidal stability, and gilteritinib loading capacity of the nanocomplex were characterized by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and dynamic light scattering technique. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the nanocomplex efficiently internalized into FLT3-mutated leukemic cells via specific interactions between the surface-exposed hyaluronic acid and CD44 receptor overexpressed on the cells. Moreover, this nanocomplex was found to induce an eradication of the leukemic cells in a synergistic manner by elevating the levels of reactive oxygen species and caspase-3/7 activities more effectively than free gilteritinib. This study may provide a useful strategy to design nanomedicines capable of augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors for effective leukemia therapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Periodontal disease (PD) is a prevalent oral affliction in canines, with limited therapeutic options available. The potential transmission of oral bacteria from canines to humans through inter-species contact poses a risk of zoonotic infection. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the principal catechin in green tea polyphenols, exhibits antibacterial properties effective against human PD. Given the clinical parallels between canine and human PD, this study explores the feasibility of employing EGCG as a therapeutic agent for canine PD. METHODS AND RESULTS: Initially, a survey and statistical analysis of bacterial infection data related to canine PD in China were conducted. Subsequently, the primary pathogenic bacteria of canine PD were isolated and cultivated, and the in vitro antibacterial efficacy of EGCG was assessed. Furthermore, verify the therapeutic effect of EGCG on a mouse PD model in vivo. The high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Treponema, Moraxella, and Capnocytophaga as the genera that distinguishing PD from healthy canines' gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples in China. The anaerobic culture and drug susceptibility testing isolated a total of 92 clinical strains, representing 22 species, from 72 canine GCF samples, including Porphyromonas gulae, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas macacae, etc. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging of EGCG was from 0.019 to 1.25 mg/mL. Following a 7 days oral mucosal administration of medium-dose EGCG (0.625 mg/mL), the abundance of periodontal microorganisms in PD mice significantly decreased. This intervention ameliorated alveolar bone loss, reducing the average cementoenamel junction to the alveolar bone crest (CEJ-ABC) distance from 0.306 mm ± 0.050 mm to 0.161 mm ± 0.026 mm. Additionally, EGCG (0.3125 mg/mL) markedly down-regulated the expression of inflammatory factor IL-6 in the serum of PD mice. CONCLUSION: Our research demonstrates the significant antibacterial effects of EGCG against the prevalent bacterium P. gulae in canine PD. Moreover, EGCG exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and proves effective in addressing bone loss in a PD mouse model. These findings collectively suggest the therapeutic potential of EGCG in the treatment of canine PD. The outcomes of this study contribute valuable data, laying the foundation for further exploration and screening of alternative antibiotic drugs to advance the management of canine PD."

      "abstract": "The dreadful scenario of cancer prevails due to the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which contribute to tumor growth, metastasis, invasion, resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy, and recurrence. CSCs are a small subpopulation of cells within the tumor that are characterized by self-renewal capability and have the potential to manifest heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells that constitute the tumor. The major bioactive green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) has been fruitful in downgrading cancer stemness signaling and CSC biomarkers in cancer progression. EGCG has been evidenced to maneuver extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in order to decrease the viability of CSCs. Cancer stemness is intricately related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastasis and therapy resistance, and EGCG has been evidenced to regress all these CSC-related effects. By inhibiting CSC characteristics EGCG has also been evidenced to sensitize the tumor cells to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, the use of EGCG in in vitro and in vivo cancer models raises concern about its bioavailability, stability and efficacy against spheroids raised from parental cells. Therefore, novel nano formulations of EGCG and adjuvant therapy of EGCG with other phytochemicals or drugs or small molecules may have a better prospect in targeting CSCs. However, extensive clinical research is still awaited to elucidate a full proof impact of EGCG in cancer therapy.",

This study was designed to investigate the curative potential of Epigallotatechin gallate (EGCG) in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders as a possible consequence of antiretroviral toxicity. Twenty-four adult male Wistar rats, weighing 80~100g, were divided into four groups and treated as follows: control A (distilled water), B (HAART), C (EGCG 2.5mg/kg), D (EGCG 2.5mg/kg) + HAART) Brain histology, immunohistochemistry, and oxidative stress markers such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH),catalase (CAT)  and malondialdehyde (MDA) were examined. The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) showed extensive architectural deformation with pyknotic neuronal cells and obliterated neurons in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Expression of inflammasome cells was also evident in this group. MDA levels increased significantly with a significant reduction in the levels of GSH, as well as antioxidant enzyme (SOD and CAT) activities compared to other treatment groups. Treatment with EGCG resulted in partial neuronal restoration of histopathological alterations, and modulation of NLRP3 inflammasome in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. EGCG also showed significant improvements in terms of increased antioxidant levels of SOD, GSH, CAT and a reduced MDA level and well-preserved brain architecture. Epigallocatechin gallate improves brain morphology and function with a reversal of HAART-induced alterations.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Uterine fibroids affect 30%-77% of reproductive-age women and are a significant cause of infertility. Surgical myomectomies can restore fertility, but they often have limited and temporary benefits, with postoperative complications such as adhesions negatively impacting fertility. Existing medical therapies, such as oral contraceptives, gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues and GnRH antagonists, can manage fibroid symptoms but are not fertility friendly. This study addresses the pressing need for non-hormonal, non-surgical treatment options for women with fibroids desiring pregnancy. Previous preclinical and clinical studies have shown that epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) effectively reduces uterine fibroid size. We hypothesise that EGCG from green tea extract will shrink fibroids, enhance endometrial quality and increase pregnancy likelihood. To investigate this hypothesis, we initiated a National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Confirm-funded trial to assess EGCG's efficacy in treating women with fibroids and unexplained infertility. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This multicentre, prospective, interventional, randomised, double-blinded clinical trial aims to enrol 200 participants with fibroids and unexplained infertility undergoing intrauterine insemination (IUI). Participants will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to two groups: green tea extract (1650 mg daily) or a matched placebo, combined with clomiphene citrate-induced ovarian stimulation and timed IUI for up to four cycles. EGCG constitutes approximately 45% of the green tea extract. The primary outcome is the cumulative live birth rate, with secondary outcomes including conception rate, time to conception, miscarriage rate, change in fibroid volume and symptom severity scores and health-related quality of life questionnaire scores. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The FRIEND trial received approval from the Food and Drug adminstration (FDA) (investigational new drug number 150951), the central Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Johns Hopkins University and FRIEND-collaborative site local IRBs. The data will be disseminated at major conferences, published in peer-reviewed journals and support a large-scale clinical trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05364008.",

The synthesized materials were characterized to determine their properties, including morphology, hydrodynamic size, charge, particle stability, and drug release profile. The therapeutic effect of AFP-siRNA and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was revealed to have remarkable cytotoxicity towards HepG2 when in soluble formulation. Notably, the killing effect was enhanced by the co-treatment of AFP-siRNA-loaded PLGA and EGCG. Cell viability significantly dropped to 59.73 ± 6.95% after treatment with 12.50 μg/mL of EGCG and AFP-siRNA-PLGA. Meanwhile, 80% of viable cells were observed after treatment with monotherapy. The reduction in the survival of cells is a clear indication of the complementary action of both active EGCG and AFP-siRNA-loaded PLGA. The corresponding cell death was involved in apoptosis, as evidenced by the increased caspase-3/7 activity. The combined treatment exhibited a 2.5-fold increase in caspase-3/7 activity. Moreover, the nanoparticles were internalized by HepG2 in a time-dependent manner, indicating the appropriate use of PLGA as a carrier. Accordingly, a combined system is an effective therapeutic strategy."

METHODS: Non-pregnant or lactating women aged between 30 and 40 years were scheduled for laparoscopic myomectomy to treat symptoms or looking to conceive. After enrollment, patients were assigned to either (1) intervention group, assuming a total of 300 mg EGCG, 50 μg vitamin D, and 50 mg DCI divided in 2 pills per day for 3 months, or (2) control group, including untreated women scheduled to undergo laparoscopic myomectomy after 3 months. RESULTS: 91 patients completed the study. The comparison of the surgical outcomes between the intervention (n = 44) and the control (n = 47) groups revealed that the treatment significantly reduces the duration of surgery (41.93 ± 7.56 min vs 56.32 ± 10.63 min, p < 0.001). Moreover, the treatment also reduced blood loss during surgery (149.09 ± 25.40 mL vs 168.41 ± 21.34 mL, p < 0.001), resulting in treated patients having higher Hb levels at discharge 11.27 ± 0.82 mL vs 10.56 ± 0.82 mL, p < 0.01). The surgery induced an increase in AST and in total bilirubin regardless of the assigned group, and the treatment induced no change in liver function. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that EGCG plus vitamin D, and DCI could represent a safe option for women with UF scheduled for laparoscopic myomectomy, improving surgical outcomes without affecting liver functionality.",

Further, we hypothesized the binding characteristics of these two compounds. The results were as follows: The quenching mechanism between WP and EGCG was characterized as static quenching. As the temperature increased, the binding constant and the binding force between EGCG and WP both increased. The number of binding sites (denoted as n) between WP and EGCG was approximately 1. Hence, WP provided a single site to bind to EGCG to form a complex. The main binding modes between WP and EGCG were hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, and they were spontaneously combined into complexes (ΔG < 0). This study provided a basis for the interaction between WP and EGCG under different heating conditions and their combination mode."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological disease that causes memory loss over time. Current therapies are limited and frequently inadequate. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antifibrosis, anti-remodeling and tissue-protective qualities that may be effective in treatment of different diseases, including AD. Because of nanoparticles' high surface area, they can enhance solubility, stability, pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, and diminish toxicities. Besides, lipid nanoparticles have a high binding affinity that can enhance the rate of drug transport across BBB. So, EGCG nanoparticles represent a promising treatment for AD. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review sought to assess the efficacy of EGCG nanoparticles against AD in rat/mouse models. METHODS: Study was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, and the protocol was registered in PROSPERO. Electronic databases were searched to discover relevant studies published up to October 2022. RESULTS: Two studies met the inclusion criteria out of 1338 and were included in this systematic review. Collectively, the results indicate that EGCG has a significant potential for reducing AD pathology and improving cognitive deficits in rat/mouse models. The formulated particles were in the nanometer range, as indicated by TEM, with good particle size control and stability. EGCG nanoparticles showed superior pharmacokinetic characteristics and improved blood-brain barrier permeability, and increased brain bioavailability compared to free EGCG. Additionally, nanoEGCG were more effective in modulating oxidative stress than free formulation and decreased AChE in the cortex and hippocampus of AlCl3-treated rats. CONCLUSION: This systematic analysis of the two studies included showed that EGCG nanoparticles are efficacious as a potential therapeutic intervention for AD in rat/mouse models. However, limited number of studies found indicates insufficient data in this research point that requires further investigation by experimental studies.",

Herein, we tested whether EGCG participates in modulating cardiac ischemia reperfusion-induced injury and elucidate its potential mechanisms. METHODS: To induce MI in mice, we employed coronary artery ligation, while cell models utilized oxygen glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R)-treated HL-1 cells. TTC, HE and Massion staining evaluated the pathological changes of heart tissues. Besides, RNA-pull down and RIP assays analyzed the interactions of MEG3/TAF15 and AIM2 mRNA/TAF15. FISH associated with immunofiuorescence (IF) double staining was conducted to measure the co-localization of MEG3 and TAF15. RESULTS: In vitro and in vivo evidence supported that EGCG treatment improved cardiomyocytes viability while inhibiting the expressions of AIM2, C-caspase-1, ASC, GSDMD-N, IL-18 and IL-1β. Knockdown of MEG3 intensified EGCG's therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo. LncRNA MEG3 and AIM2 mRNA interacted with TAF15, and MEG3, in turn, promoted the stability of AIM2 mRNA through regulating TAF15. Overexpression of TAF15 reversed the promoting effect of EGCG and MEG3 knockdown on cell viability, and the inhibiting effect on cell pyroptosis. CONCLUSION: EGCG protected cardiomyocytes from pyroptosis by the MEG3/TAF15/AIM2 axis, indicating EGCG as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for managing MI."

Our study was designed to evaluate the anti-cancer effects of EGCG on ovarian cancer and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. To evaluate the in vitro inhibitory effects of EGCG against ovarian cancer, MTT assay, colony formation assay, apoptosis assay, and wound healing assay, were performed. Besides, the inhibitory effects of EGCG on tumor growth in the xenograft animal model were evaluated by measuring tumor volume and tumor weight. Moreover, Western blotting and qPCR were used to evaluate the levels of target genes and proteins. Treatment with EGCG inhibited cell migration and cell survival, and promoted cell apoptosis in A2780 and SKOV3 cells. Interestingly, treatment with EGCG inhibited the tumor growth in the xenograft animal model. The mechanistic study revealed that treatment with EGCG induced the activation of FOXO3A and suppressed the expression of c-Myc both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that EGCG suppress ovarian cancer cell growth, which may be due to its regulation on FOXO3A and c-Myc.",

Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the most potent antioxidant in green tea. Our results demonstrated that EGCG could effectively reduce apoptosis of LECs and retard lens clouding in aged mice. By comparing transcriptome sequencing results of three groups of mice (young control, untreated aged, and EGCG-treated) and screening using GO and KEGG analyses, we selected RASSF2 as the effector gene of EGCG for mechanistic exploration. We verified that the differential expression of RASSF2 was associated with the occurrence of ARC in clinical samples and mouse tissues by immunohistochemistry and western blotting, respectively. We showed that high RASSF2 expression plays a crucial role in the oxidative induction of apoptosis in LECs, as revealed by overexpression and interference experiments. Further studies showed that RASSF2 mediates the inhibitory effect of EGCG on apoptosis and ARCogenesis in LECs by regulating AKT (Ser473) phosphorylation. In this study, we found for the first time the retarding effect of EGCG on lens clouding in mice and revealed the mechanism of action of RASSF2/AKT in it, which provides a theoretical basis for the targeted treatment of EGCG.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis, one of the serious public health problems worldwide, can lead to degeneration of the bone structure and increased risk of fractures. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a natural product with potential efficacy in inhibiting bone loss. However, the specific mechanism remains unclear. This study first investigated the role of EGCG in preventing dexamethasone (DEX)-induced osteoporosis by regulating intestinal microbiota and serum metabolites. We detected the bone density, bone microstructure, and changes in intestinal microorganisms and serum metabolites. According to our results, EGCG inhibited the decline of bone density, protected the bone microstructure, increased microbial diversity, promoted the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Prevotellaceae and Ruminococcus, and inhibited the abundance of pathogenic bacteria such as Peptostreptococcaceae. There were also significant changes in serum metabolites among different treatments. Differential metabolites were mainly involved in sphingolipid metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism pathways, especially ceramide (d18:0/16:0(2OH)), phosphatidylserine (P-20:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)), phosphatidylserine (18:2(9Z,12Z)/12:0), and phosphatidylethanolamine (O-16:0/0:00), which were increased after EGCG treatment. Notably, most of the above metabolites were positively correlated with bone mineral density, BV/TV and Tb·Th, and negatively correlated with Tb·Sp. In summary, EGCG can prevent bone damage, promote the production of beneficial bacteria and metabolites, and enhance immune function. This study provides a basis and reference for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, as well as the application of EGCG in maintaining body health.",

The present research studied the effects of EGCG on the laying performance, egg quality, immune status, antioxidant capacity, and hepatic metabolome of Linwu laying ducks reared under high temperature. A total of 180 42-w-old healthy Linwu laying ducks were allocated into control or EGCG-treated groups. Each treatment had 6 replicates with 15 ducks in each replicate. Diets for the two groups were basal diets supplemented with 0 or 300 mg/kg EGCG, respectively. All ducks were raised in the high temperature condition (35 ± 2 °C for 6 h from 10:00 to 16:00, and 28 ± 2 °C for the other 18 h from 16:00 to 10:00 the next day) for 21 days. Results showed that EGCG increased the egg production rate (p = 0.014) and enhanced the immunocompetence by improving serum levels of immunoglobulin A (p = 0.008) and immunoglobulin G (p = 0.006). EGCG also fortified the antioxidant capacity by activating superoxide dismutase (p = 0.012), catalase (p = 0.009), and glutathione peroxidase (p = 0.021), and increasing the level of heat-shock protein 70 (p = 0.003) in laying ducks' liver. At the same time, hepatic metabolomics result suggested that EGCG increased the concentration of several key metabolites, such as spermidine (p = 0.031), tetramethylenediamine (p = 0.009), hyoscyamine (p = 0.026), β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (p = 0.038), and pantothenic acid (p = 0.010), which were involved in the metabolic pathways of glutathione metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, β-alanine metabolism, and tropane, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis. In conclusion, 300 mg/kg dietary EGCG showed protection effects on the laying ducks reared in high temperature by improving the immune and antioxidant capacities, which contributed to the increase of laying performance of ducks. The potential mechanism could be that EGCG modulate the synthesis of key metabolites and associated metabolic pathways.",

Infected mice treated intranasally (HSV-1) or intravaginally (HSV-2) with EGCG-AgNPs showed lower virus titers in comparison to treatment with EGCG alone. After EGCG-AgNPs treatment, mucosal tissues showed a significant infiltration in dendritic cells and monocytes in comparison to NaCl-treated group, followed by significantly better infiltration of CD8+ T cells, NK cells and increased expression of IFN-α, IFN-γ, CXCL9 and CXCL10.

Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and coconut oil have been shown to be effective against dyslipidemia. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between lipid profiles, fat consumption, and functional disability in patients with MS after administering EGCG and coconut oil. METHODS: A four-month pilot study was conducted on 45 MS patients, divided into an intervention group (IG) and a control group (CG). The IG received 800 mg of EGCG and 60 mL of coconut oil. Lipid profiles were measured before and after the intervention, along with other data such as dietary habits, inflammatory markers, and functional capacity. RESULTS: Dyslipidemia did not correlate with the patients' fat consumption. After the intervention, triglycerides (TG) levels were lower in IG compared to CG. This decrease was positively correlated with an improvement in functional disability (determined by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)) and negatively with high-density cholesterol (HDL) and apolipoprotein A1. Significant and positive correlations were observed between EDSS and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the IG. These changes in the IG could be related to body fat decrease, whose percentage shows a positive correlation with CRP and TG levels, and a negative correlation with HDL levels. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MS present a certain type of dyslipemia not associated with their nutritional habits. The administration of EGCG and coconut oil seems to decrease blood TG levels, which could explain the functional improvements."

Oral microecological imbalances have been identified as a potential risk factor for numerous oral and systemic diseases. As a representative component of tea, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) has demonstrated inhibitory effects on most pathogens in single-microbial models. In this study, the regulatory effect of EGCG on more complex oral microbial systems was further explored through a mouse model of acetic acid-induced oral inflammation. Acetic acid induces histological damage in the cheek pouch, tongue, and throat, such as broken mucosa, submucosal edema, and muscular disorders. These detrimental effects were ameliorated significantly following EGCG treatment. Additionally, EGCG reduced the levels of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α to alleviate the inflammation of the tongue, cheek pouch, and throat. According to the 16S rDNA gene sequencing data, EGCG treatment contributed to increased diversity of the oral microbiota and the reversal of oral microecological disorder. This study demonstrates the regulatory effect of EGCG on dysregulated oral microbiota, providing a potential option for the prevention and treatment of oral-microbiota-associated diseases.",

This study investigates the combined use of EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib or osimertinib) with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) to overcome acquired drug resistance in NSCLC models. The in vitro antiproliferative effects of EGFR-TKIs and EGCG combination in EGFR-mutant parental and resistant cell lines were evaluated. The in vivo efficacy of the combination was assessed in xenograft mouse models derived from EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC cells. We found that the combined use of EGFR-TKIs and EGCG significantly reversed the Warburg effect by suppressing glycolysis while boosting mitochondrial respiration, which was accompanied by increased cellular ROS and decreased lactate secretion. The combination effectively activated the AMPK pathway while inhibited both ERK/MAPK and AKT/mTOR pathways, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, particularly in drug-resistant NSCLC cells. The in vivo results obtained from mouse tumor xenograft model confirmed that EGCG effectively overcame osimertinib resistance. This study revealed that EGCG suppressed cancer bypass survival signaling and altered cancer metabolic profiles, which is a promising anticancer adjuvant of EGFR-TKIs to overcome acquired drug resistance in NSCLC.",

In this work, new carriers are proposed, i.e., zeolites containing divalent ions of magnesium, calcium, strontium, and zinc in their structure. EGCG is retained on the carrier surface by strong interactions with divalent ions. Due to the presence of strong interactions, EGCG is released in a controlled manner from the carrier-ion-EGCG drug delivery system. The results obtained in this work confirm the effectiveness of the preparation of new carriers. EGCG is released from the carriers depending on the pH; hence, it can be used both in osteoporosis and in the treatment of cancer. The divalent ion used affects the sorption and release of the drug. The obtained results indicate the great potential of the proposed carriers and their advantage over the carriers described in the literature.",

      "abstract": "Morbid dermal templates, microangiopathy, and abnormal inflammation are the three most critical reasons for the scarred healing and the high recurrence rate of diabetic wounds. In this present study, a combination of a methacrylated decellularized extracellular matrix (ECMMA, aka EM)-based hydrogel system loaded with copper-epigallocatechin gallate (Cu-EGCG) capsules is proposed to fabricate bio-printed dermal scaffolds for diabetic wound treatment. Copper ions act as a bioactive element for promoting angiogenesis, and EGCG can inhibit inflammation on the wound site. In addition to the above activities, EM/Cu-EGCG (E/C) dermal scaffolds can also provide optimized templates and nutrient exchange space for guiding the orderly deposition and remodeling of ECM. In vitro experiments have shown that the E/C hydrogel can promote angiogenesis and inhibit the polarization of macrophages to the M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype. In the full-thickness skin defect model of diabetic rats, the E/C dermal scaffold combined with split-thickness skin graft transplantation can alleviate pathological scarring via promoting angiogenesis and driving macrophage polarization to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. These may be attributed to the scaffold-actuated expression of angiogenesis-related genes in the HIF-1α/vascular endothelial growth factor pathway and decreased expression of inflammation-related genes in the TNF-α/NF-κB/MMP9 pathway. The results of this study show that the E/C dermal scaffold could serve as a promising artificial dermal analogue for solving the problems of delayed wound healing and reulceration of diabetic wounds.",

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease that is so far incurable with long-term health risks. The high doses and frequent administration for the available RA drug always lead to adverse side effects. Aiming at the obstacles to achieving effective RA treatment, we prepared macrophage cell membrane-camouflaged nanoparticles (M-EC), which were assembled from epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and cerium(IV) ions. Due to its geometrical similarity to the active metal sites of a natural antioxidant enzyme, the EC possessed a high scavenge efficiency to various types of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). The macrophage cell membrane assisted M-EC in escaping from the immune system, being uptaken by inflammatory cells, and specifically binding IL-1β. After tail vein injection to the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model, the M-EC accumulated at inflamed joints and effectively repaired the bone erosion and cartilage damage of rheumatoid arthritis by relieving synovial inflammation and cartilage erosion. It is expected that the M-EC can not only pave a new way for designing metal-phenolic networks with better biological activity but also provide a more biocompatible therapeutic strategy for effective treatment of RA.",

Though remarkable breakthroughs have been made in the therapeutic strategies recently, the overall survival of HCC remains unsatisfactory. Consequently, the therapy of HCC remains a great challenge. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a natural polyphenol extracted from the leaves of the tea bush, has been extensively investigated for its antitumor effects. In this review, we summarize the previous literature to elucidate the roles of EGCG in the chemoprophylaxis and therapy of HCC. Accumulating evidence has confirmed EGCG prevents and inhibits the hepatic tumorigenesis and progression through multiple biological mechanisms, mainly involving hepatitis virus infection, oxidative stress, proliferation, invasion, migration, angiogenesis, apoptosis, autophagy, and tumor metabolism. Furthermore, EGCG enhances the efficacy and sensitivity of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy in HCC. In conclusion, preclinical studies have confirmed the potential of EGCG for chemoprevention and therapy of HCC under multifarious experimental models and conditions. Nevertheless, there is an urgent need to explore the safety and efficacy of EGCG in the clinical practice of HCC."

      "abstract": "Mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) exposure is known to induce severe testicular injury via reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, few effective treatments are available for the precise treatment of MEHP-induced germ cell damage. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), one of the major polyphenols in green tea, has potential antioxidant activity and can alleviate many diseases induced by oxidative stress. This study explored whether EGCG protects germ cells from MEHP-induced oxidative stress damage. Cells were treated with 400 μM MEHP and 60 μM EGCG for 24 h. EGCG reduced MEHP-induced ROS overgeneration in the spermatogonial cell line GC-1 and spermatocyte cell line GC-2. Western blotting and immunofluorescence showed that the MEHP+EGCG group exhibited lower nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2), heme oxygenase (decycling) 1 (HO-1), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression than the MEHP group. Moreover, activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway was decreased. The expression of key factors of pyroptosis was downregulated, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression was reduced. Additionally, apoptosis was inhibited by EGCG. The findings indicate that EGCG protects against MEHP-induced germ cell pyroptosis by scavenging ROS, suppressing the mTOR pathway, and inhibiting pyroptosis. EGCG may thus be a potential treatment for MEHP-related spermatogenic dysfunction.",

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) may be a protective agent against it, but no data are available regarding its impact on cardiac dysfunction. We investigated the presence of cardiac alterations in mice prenatally exposed to alcohol and the effect of postnatal EGCG treatment on cardiac function and related biochemical pathways. C57BL/6J pregnant mice received 1.5 g/kg/day (Mediterranean pattern), 4.5 g/kg/day (binge pattern) of ethanol, or maltodextrin until Day 19 of pregnancy. Post-delivery, treatment groups received EGCG-supplemented water. At post-natal Day 60, functional echocardiographies were performed. Heart biomarkers of apoptosis, oxidative stress, and cardiac damage were analyzed by Western blot. BNP and Hif1α increased and Nrf2 decreased in mice prenatally exposed to the Mediterranean alcohol pattern. Bcl-2 was downregulated in the binge PAE drinking pattern. Troponin I, glutathione peroxidase, and Bax increased in both ethanol exposure patterns. Prenatal alcohol exposure led to cardiac dysfunction in exposed mice, evidenced by a reduced ejection fraction, left ventricle posterior wall thickness at diastole, and Tei index. EGCG postnatal therapy restored the physiological levels of these biomarkers and improved cardiac dysfunction. These findings suggest that postnatal EGCG treatment attenuates the cardiac damage caused by prenatal alcohol exposure in the offspring."

      "abstract": "Polyphenol-rich foods exhibit anti-allergic/-inflammatory properties. As major effector cells of allergies, mast cells undergo degranulation after activation and then initiate inflammatory responses. Key immune phenomena could be regulated by the production and metabolism of lipid mediators by mast cells. Here, we analyzed the antiallergic activities of two representative dietary polyphenols, curcumin and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and traced their effects on cellular lipidome rewiring in the progression of degranulation. Both curcumin and EGCG significantly inhibited degranulation as they suppressed the release of β-hexosaminidase, interleukin-4, and tumor necrosis factor-α from the IgE/antigen-stimulated mast cell model. A comprehensive lipidomics study involving 957 identified lipid species revealed that although the lipidome remodeling patterns (lipid response and composition) of curcumin intervention were considerably similar to those of EGCG, lipid metabolism was more potently disturbed by curcumin. Seventy-eight percent of significant differential lipids upon IgE/antigen stimulation could be regulated by curcumin/EGCG. LPC-O 22:0 was defined as a potential biomarker for its sensitivity to IgE/antigen stimulation and curcumin/EGCG intervention. The key changes in diacylglycerols, fatty acids, and bismonoacylglycerophosphates provided clues that cell signaling disturbances could be associated with curcumin/EGCG intervention. Our work supplies a novel perspective for understanding curcumin/EGCG involvement in antianaphylaxis and helps guide future attempts to use dietary polyphenols."

People with seborrhea also have trouble with selecting moisturizers. l-Carnitine and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) are reported anti-sebum properties. However, neither efficacy comparison nor the combination effect of the two topical anti-sebum agents was studied. Moisturizing cream with these agents is supposed to provide skin with an optimal water-oil balance. AIMS: To compare the efficacy of moisturizer containing 2% l-carnitine or 5% EGCG alone on sebum controlling, and the synergistic effect of these two agents. METHODS: Three study creams were formulated by adding three kinds of anti-sebum agents which were 2% l-carnitine, 5% EGCG, and 2% l-carnitine plus 5% EGCG in moisturizing cream base of dimethicone and glycerin. A randomized clinical trial was conducted. Ninety subjects, divided into three groups, applied the cream for 4 weeks. Sebum level, skin capacitance, and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were evaluated at Weeks 0, 1, 2, and 4. Life qualities and subjective outcomes were assessed before and after treatment. RESULTS: The mean sebum reduction from baseline was statistically significant in all treatment groups (p < 0.01). The median time to oil control was longer in l-carnitine group. The combine group had significantly greater anti-sebum efficacy than l-carnitine group (p = 0.009). All three groups had significant improvement of other objective parameters and subjective outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-sebum moisturizing cream exhibited beneficial effect on the sebum reduction with improve skin hydration in people with seborrhea and made users satisfied. The EGCG group and the combine group show the greater anti-sebum effect than the l-carnitine group."

Compared with the traditional free radical condition, the ultrasonic-assisted processing significantly increased the conjugating efficiency of OVA and EGCG and shortened the conjugating from 24 h to 1 h without affecting the equivalent amount of EGCG conjugating. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and multi-spectroscopy analysis (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy, and UV spectroscopy) indicated that the covalent conjugates could be formed between OVA and EGCG. And modification in the conformation of OVA was induced by EGCG. Furthermore, molecular docking results demonstrated the possession of high-affinity EGCG binding location on OVA, supporting and clarifying the experimental results. In addition, the functional properties of OVA including emulsification (emulsifying activity and emulsion stability) and antioxidant properties (DPPH scavenging capacity and ABTS scavenging capacity) were significantly improved after conjugation with EGCG, especially in ultrasound-assisted conditions. Overall, OVA-EGCG conjugates produced by ultrasound-assisted free radical treatment could be applied as a potential emulsifier and antioxidant, thereby expanding the application of OVA as a dual-functional ingredient.",

      "abstract": "Glioma is the most devastating high-grade tumor of the central nervous system, with dismal prognosis. Existing treatment modality does not provide substantial benefit to patients and demands novel strategies. One of the first-line treatments for glioma, temozolomide, provides marginal benefit to glioma patients. Repurposing of existing non-cancer drugs to treat oncology patients is gaining momentum in recent years. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic benefits of combining three repurposed drugs, namely, metformin (anti-diabetic) and epigallocatechin gallate (green tea-derived antioxidant) together with temozolomide in a glioma-induced xenograft rat model. Our triple-drug combination therapy significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo and increased the survival rate (50%) of rats when compared with individual or dual treatments. Molecular and cellular analyses revealed that our triple-drug cocktail treatment inhibited glioma tumor growth in rat model through ROS-mediated inactivation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, arrest of the cell cycle at G1 phase and induction of molecular mechanisms of caspases-dependent apoptosis.In addition, the docking analysis and quantum mechanics studies performed here hypothesize that the effect of triple-drug combination could have been attributed by their difference in molecular interactions, that maybe due to varying electrostatic potential. Thus, repurposing metformin and epigallocatechin gallate and concurrent administration with temozolomide would serve as a prospective therapy in glioma patients."

      "abstract": "Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic advanced liver disease that is highly related to metabolic disorders and induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). Recently, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) has been regarded as a protective bioactive polyphenol in green tea that has the ability to protect against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, but the molecular mechanism remains poorly deciphered. Ferroptosis plays a vital role in the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, but experimental evidence of ferroptosis inhibition by epigallocatechin gallate is limited. Hence, our study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanisms of epigallocatechin gallate on hepatic ferroptosis to mitigate hepatic injury in high-fat diet-fed mice. Methods: Fifty male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a standard chow diet (SCD), a high-fat diet, or a high-fat diet and administered epigallocatechin gallate or ferrostatin-1 (a ferroptosis-specific inhibitor) for 12 weeks. Liver injury, lipid accumulation, hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, iron overload, and ferroptosis marker proteins were examined. In vitro, steatotic L-02 cells were used to explore the underlying mechanism. Results: In our research, we found that epigallocatechin gallate notably alleviated liver injury and lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, hepatic steatosis, decreased iron overload and inhibited ferroptosis in a high-fat diet-induced murine model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In vitro experiments, using ferrostatin-1 and a mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (MtROS) scavenger (Mito-TEMPO), we found that epigallocatechin gallate remarkably alleviated oxidative stress and inhibited ferroptosis by reducing the level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in steatotic L-02 cells. Conclusion: Taken together, our results revealed that epigallocatechin gallate may exert protective effects on hepatic lipotoxicity by inhibiting mitochondrial reactive oxygen species-mediated hepatic ferroptosis. Findings from our study provide new insight into prevention and treatment strategies for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease pathological processes."

      "abstract": "Head and neck cancers are among the deadliest cancers, ranked sixth globally in rates of high mortality and poor patient prognoses. The prevalence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is associated with smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. Despite several advances in diagnostic and interventional methods, the morbidity of subjects with HNSCC has remained unchanged over the last 30 years. Epigenetic alterations, such as DNA hypermethylation, are commonly associated with several cancers, including HNSCC. Thus, epigenetic changes are considered promising therapeutic targets for chemoprevention. Here, we investigated the effect of EGCG on DNA hypermethylation and the growth of HNSCC. First, we assessed the expression levels of global DNA methylation in HNSCC cells (FaDu and SCC-1) and observed enhanced methylation levels compared with normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE). Treatment of EGCG to HNSCC cells significantly inhibited global DNA hypermethylation by up to 70-80% after 6 days. Inhibition of DNA hypermethylation in HNSCC cells was confirmed by the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5-mc) into 5-hydroxy methylcytosine (5hmC). DNA methyltransferases regulate DNA methylation. Next, we checked the effect of EGCG on the expression levels of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and DNMT activity. Treatment of EGCG to HNSCC cells significantly reduced DNMT activity to 60% in SCC-1 and 80% in FaDu cells. The protein levels of DNMT3a and DNMT3b were downregulated in both cell lines after EGCG treatment. EGCG treatment to HNSCC cells reactivated tumor suppressors and caused decreased cell proliferation. Our in vivo study demonstrated that administration of EGCG (0.5%, w/w) as a supplement within an AIN76A diet resulted in inhibition of tumor growth in FaDu xenografts in nude mice (80%; p < 0.01) compared with non-EGCG-treated controls. The growth inhibitory effect of dietary EGCG on the HNSCC xenograft tumors was associated with the inhibition of DNMTs and reactivation of silenced tumor suppressors. Together, our study provides evidence that EGCG acts as a DNA demethylating agent and can reactivate epigenetically silenced tumor suppressors to inhibit the growth of HNSCC cells."

      "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate the effect of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in preventing lens opacity and the aggregation of lens αB-crystallin in model rats of diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: This experimental study included Wistar rats for DM as in vivo models and divided into 5 groups. The treatment groups were administered EGCG by orally for 20d and were then assessed for their degree of lens opacity with binocular microscope and lens αB-crystallin expression from Western blot analyze. RESULTS: Pearson correlation test and regression analysis on EGCG exposure and final random blood sugar (RBS) obtained a significance level of P<0.05. EGCG exposure can significantly lower RBS with an R 2 of 0.5634 (56.34%). The same analysis on EGCG exposure and the degree of lens opacity obtained a significance level of P<0.05 and increased exposure to EGCG can significantly lower the degree of lens opacity with an R 2 of 0.8577 (85.77%). Correlation analysis between EGCG and the expression of lens αB-crystallin can be concluded that the higher the EGCG exposure administered, the higher the native lens αB-crystallin expression and the lower the aggregate lens αB-crystallin expression. There was also significant effect in which every 1 mg/kg body weight dose of EGCG can increase the native lens αB-crystallin expression by 0.0063 and decrease the aggregate lens αB-crystallin expression by 0.0076. CONCLUSION: The administration of EGCG at a dose of 300, 600, and 1200 mg shows a significant effect on preventing lens opacity and aggregation of αB-crystallin in diabetic rat models and this research could be a biomolecular prevention of cataract."

      "abstract": "In this study, a ternary conjugate was prepared by covalent bonding of protein, polysaccharide, and polyphenol via ultrasound and the Maillard reaction. Subsequently, the β-carotene nanoemulsion was prepared with the soy protein isolate-(-)-epigallocatechin gallate-maltose (SPI-EGCG-maltose) conjugate as the emulsifiers via ultrasound. The SPI-EGCG-maltose conjugate showed superior solubility, emulsification and foaming properties at 4 h reaction time. Meanwhile, the retention rates of β-carotene in the nanoemulsion after 30 d of storage, 8 h of light, and 55 °C of heat were >60%, >75%, and >60%, respectively. Furthermore, ultrasound treatment at 500 W for 10 min produced an inhibitory effect on the degradation of β-carotene. This study indicates that the nanoemulsion based on the ternary conjugate can effectively inhibit the β-carotene degradation by the external environment and prevent the oxidation and degradation of β-carotene in the nanoemulsion.",

      "abstract": "The current study set out to elucidate the function of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) against peritoneal fibrosis in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Firstly, human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) were pretreated with 0, 12.5, 25, 50 or 100μmol/L EGCG. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) models were induced by advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Untreated-cells were regarded as the blank control group. Changes in proliferation and migration were analyzed by MTT assay and scratch test and levels of HPMC epithelial and interstitial molecular marker proteins were measured by Western blot assay and immunofluorescence, while trans-endothelial resistance was assessed using an epithelial trans membrane cell resistance meter. Inhibition rates of HPMCs, migration numbers and the levels of Snail, E-cadherin, CK and ZO-1 were all decreased, while the levels of α-SMA and FSP1 and trans cellular resistance values were increased in treatment groups (P<0.05). With the increase of EGCG concentrations, HPMCs growth inhibition rates and migration numbers, the levels of α-SMA and FSP1 and TER values were decreased and the levels of Snail, E-cadherin, CK and ZO-1 were enhanced (P<0.05). Overall, the current study highlights that EGCG effectively inhibits the proliferation and migration of HPMCs, increases permeability, suppresses EMT and ultimately delays peritoneal fibrosis.",
