      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder recognized for inducing endothelial dysfunction in coronary arteries. This study aimed to investigate the synergistic effects of valerian hydroalcoholic extract and exercise in diabetic rats. METHODS: Thirty-five Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups: control, diabetes, diabetic rats undergoing treadmill exercise, diabetic rats administered valerian extract (200 mg/kg, oral), and diabetic rats receiving a combination of valerian extract and treadmill exercise for 8 weeks. Antioxidants and lipoproteins were assessed via blood sampling at the study's conclusion. Hemodynamic parameters and the response of the coronary artery bed to constrictors and dilators were evaluated by connecting the heart to a Langendorff device. RESULTS: Diabetes was associated with a diminished vascular vasodilator response, which was enhanced by the combined treatment of valerian extract and 8 weeks of exercise. Moreover, elevated levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were observed in groups receiving both valerian extract and exercise. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the combination of treadmill exercise and hydroalcoholic extract may hold promise in managing cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients by leveraging their antioxidant properties."

      "abstract": "Valerian possesses a multitude of pharmacological effects, including sedative and hypnotic properties, antihypertensive effects, antibacterial activity, and liver protection. Insomnia, one of the most prevalent disorders in contemporary society, significantly impacts people's daily lives. This study aims to explore the anti-insomnia effects of valerian volatile oil (VVO) and investigate its potential mechanism of action through chemical analysis, network pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental validation. Through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis and drug-likeness screening, we identified 38 active compounds. Network pharmacology studies revealed that these 38 compounds might affect 103 targets associated with insomnia, such as monoamine oxidase B (MAOB), dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2), monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), interleukin 1β (IL1B), solute carrier family 6 member 4 (SLC6A4), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (HTR2A), which contribute to regulating the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, 5-hydroxytryptaminergic synapse, and calcium signaling pathways. The results of the molecular dynamics simulations indicated that bis[(6,6-dimethyl-3-bicyclo[3.1.1]hept-2-enyl)methyl] (E)-but-2-enedioate exhibited a stabilizing interaction with MAOB. The animal studies demonstrated that gavage administration of a high dose (100 mg/kg) of VVO significantly diminished autonomous activity, decreased sleep latency, and extended sleep duration in mice. Furthermore, the results of the Western blot experiment indicated that VVO interacts with MAOB, resulting in decreased expression levels of MAOB in the cerebral cortex. This study demonstrates the protective mechanism of VVO against insomnia through chemical analysis, network pharmacology, and experimental validation and extends the possible applications of VVO, which is a potential therapeutic ingredient for use in insomnia treatment.",

      "abstract": "Valerian is one of the most used herbal agents (phytotherapeutics) to manage sleep disturbances, in particular, sleep-onset difficulties in young adults. However, the evidence based on primary studies and systematic reviews that supports its use in this domain is weak or inconclusive. In the current study, an umbrella review was performed on the efficacy of valerian for sleep disturbances with a focus on insomnia. As such, only systematic reviews (with or without meta-analysis) were considered for this study. Systematic searches in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PROSPERO and CNKI databases retrieved 70 records. Only 8 articles were considered eligible for qualitative analysis. Overall, data suggested that valerian has a good safety profile, however, the results showed no evidence of efficacy for the treatment of insomnia. Moreover, valerian appears to be effective concerning subjective improvement of sleep quality, although its effectiveness has not been demonstrated with quantitative or objective measurements. Despite its widespread use and prescription by general practitioners, psychiatrists and other professionals, valerian does not have empirical support for insomnia. Further studies, in particular high quality randomized controlled trials, are highly recommended since there are scarce studies and the existing ones are quite heterogeneous and with low methodological quality. The implications of our findings for clinical practice are critically discussed.",

They are perceived as safe alternatives to synthetic drugs, but limited information is available on the intestinal absorption and interaction with human intestinal microbiota of pharmacologically relevant constituents valerenic acid in valerian, and hyperforin and hypericin in St. John's wort. The intestinal permeability of these compounds and the antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs citalopram and diazepam was investigated in the Caco-2 cell model with bidirectional transport experiments. In addition, interaction of compounds and herbal extracts with intestinal microbiota was evaluated in artificial human gut microbiota. Microbiota-mediated metabolisation of compounds was assessed, and bacterial viability and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) production were measured in the presence of compounds or herbal extracts. Valerenic acid and hyperforin were highly permeable in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Hypericin showed low-to-moderate permeability. An active transport process was potentially involved in the transfer of valerenic acid. Hyperforin and hypericin were mainly transported through passive transcellular diffusion. All compounds were not metabolized over 24 h in the artificial gut microbiota. Microbial SCFA production and bacterial viability was not substantially impaired nor promoted by exposure to the compounds or herbal extracts.",

Although used as a mild sedative, limited evidence focused on the potential antinociceptive effect of valerian and hops combination. The present study was carried out to evaluate the in vivo anti-nociceptive effect of the valerian-hops combination to justify its use as an effective and safe analgesic agent. Anti-nociceptive effects of valerian-hops combination (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) were assessed in swiss albino mice for performing the acetic acid-induced writhing test, the paw licking test using formalin, the paw licking test using glutamate, and the tail immersion test. The effects were compared to those of diclofenac or morphine in the presence or absence of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. Valerian-hops\" extract of 100 and 200 mg/kg demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of writhing episodes induced by acetic acid compared to the control (p < 0.05), a significant reduction in the licking number at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg in the late phase formalin-induced paw licking, significantly reduced the number of lickings after glutamate injection compared to control (p < 0.05). And significantly increased pain reaction after 60 and 90 min of tail immersion test, this effect was opposed by naloxone treatment. The valerian-hops combination produced a significant antinociceptive effect that involved the opioid system. Further studies are required to fully uncover the underlying active constituents and their mechanisms."

      "abstract": "Valerian volatile oil can be used in the treatment of insomnia; however, the active components and mechanisms of action are currently unclear. Therefore, we used transcriptome sequencing and weight coefficient network pharmacology to predict the effective components and mechanism of action of valerian volatile oil in an insomnia model induced by intraperitoneal injection of para-Chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) in SD rats. Valerian essential oil was given orally for treatment and the contents of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1 A (5-HT1AR), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and protein kinase A (PKA) in the hippocampus of rats in each group were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blot, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and immunohistochemistry. The results showed that after treatment with valerian essential oil, insomnia rats showed significantly prolonged sleep duration and alleviated insomnia-induced tension and anxiety. Regarding the mechanism of action, we believe that caryophyllene in valerian essential oil upregulates the 5-HT1AR receptor to improve the activity or affinity of the central transmitter 5-HT, increase the release of 5-HT, couple 5-HT with a G protein coupled receptor, convert adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into cAMP (catalyzed by ADCY5), and then directly regulate the downstream pathway. Following pathway activation, we propose that the core gene protein kinase PKA activates the serotonergic synapse signal pathway to increase the expression of 5-HT and GABA, thus improving insomnia symptoms and alleviating anxiety. This study provides a theoretical basis for the application of valerian volatile oil in health food."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Valerian extract capsule (VEC) is an effective Chinese patent medicine used for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the detailed pharmacological activity for VEC clinical effects in GI diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: control, model, and drug-treated (VEC-L, VEC-M, VEC-H, and teprenone). Rats were orally administered VEC (124, 248, 496 mg/kg) and teprenone (21.43 mg/kg) for 3 consecutive days. After 1 h, the five groups (except the control group) were orally given ethanol (10 mL/kg) for 1 h or indomethacin (80 mg/kg) for 7 h. The spasmolytic activity of VEC (0.01-1 mg/mL) on ACh/BaCl2-induced New Zealand rabbit smooth muscle contraction was performed. The C57BL/6 mice carbon propelling test evaluated the effects of VEC (248-992 mg/kg) on intestinal motility in normal and neostigmine/adrenaline-induced mice. RESULTS: Compared with the model group, VEC treatment reduced the gastric lesion index and mucosal damage. Further experiments showed that the pathological ameliorative effect of VEC was accompanied by augmentation of the enzymatic antioxidant system and cytoprotective marker (COX-1, p < 0.01; PGI2 p < 0.05;), along with the alleviation of the levels of MPO (ethanol: 15.56 ± 0.82 vs. 12.15 ± 2.60, p < 0.01; indomethacin: 9.65 ± 3.06 vs. 6.36 ± 2.43, p < 0.05), MDA (ethanol: 1.66 ± 0.44 vs. 0.81 ± 0.58, p < 0.01; indomethacin: 1.71 ± 0.87 vs. 1.09 ± 0.43, p < 0.05), and inflammatory mediators. VEC decreased the high tone induced by ACh/BaCl2 and promoted intestinal transit in normal and neostigmine/adrenaline-induced mice. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: VEC showed a potential gastroprotective effect, suggesting that VEC is a promising phytomedicine for the treatment of GI diseases.",

      "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Postoperative sleep disturbances appear to be a common complication after surgery being treated with sleep-promoting medication such as valerian, but robust data and evidence of medicinal approaches are lacking. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of all 21 168 urological, gynecological, and general surgical patients of the University Medical Center Freiburg, Germany, who underwent surgery between 2015 and 2020. Target parameters were the usage of sleep-promoting medication to estimate the occurrence of postoperative sleep disturbances as well as the kind of sleep medication with a special focus on herbal medication such as valerian. RESULTS: Drug-treated sleep disturbances occurred in 15% (n = 3083) of the patients. Valerian was the second most applied drug (n = 814, 26.4%) after classic benzodiazepines (n = 1 138, 36.9%). The majority of patients got valerian as monotherapy. Age, length of stay, and comorbidities were associated with demand for sleep medication in general (p < .001). Valerian monotherapy was more common in women (OR 1.53, 95% CI: 1.33-1.77, p < .001), elderly patients (OR 1.50, 95% CI: 1.29-1.75, p < .001), and patients with prolonged hospital stay (OR 2.23, 95% CI: 1.91-2.61, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Valerian plays an important role in the treatment of postoperative sleep disturbances clinically, and it appears to be a promising therapeutic approach especially in women, older and sicker patients, and those with prolonged hospital stay. Further research has to clarify the efficacy of valerian postoperatively.

Despite its widespread use in most countries all around the world, there is little scientific information and research on how this medication affects sleep patterns, and there are almost no studies on its effects on the characteristics of sleep spindles. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of Valerian extract (VAL) on sleep spindles and induced anxiety in chronic neuropathic pain model in rats. 24 male rats were divided into three groups: neuropathic group (n=9) in which the rats underwent chronic constriction injury (CCI), sham group (n=7) in which the sciatic nerves of the animals were exposed without any constriction and also fed with the vehicle, and the third group was under CCI condition and treated with Valerian (n=8). All the rats underwent electrode implant surgery so that we could record electroencephalogram and electromyography waves. In all the three groups, EEG and EMG recordings were recorded three times (150min each time). The initial recording was just prior to the CCI surgery and the rest were 3 and 6 days following CCI surgery. Moreover, cold allodynia and elevated plus maze tests were performed 3 and 6 days following the CCI surgery. RESULTS: Valerian treatment could repair the allodynia induced by neuropathy. On the other hand, by Valerian treatment (400mg/kg) during neuropathy, the REM sleep, decreased and the non-REM sleep increased. Moreover, there was an increment in sleep spindle density and spindle frequency even in neuropathic condition. DISCUSSION: This herbal supplement improves the quality of sleep in neuropathy conditions."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Traditional treatment methods are becoming popular and commonly used in many societies and have become the first treatment option for most people. While some of these methods are helpful, they can interact with medications the patient is taking for another disease and cause a variety of life-threatening risks. Valerian (catweed) plant is used in traditional medicine as a sleep aid due to its sedative effects. Valerian may also exert anticancer effect in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the cytotoxicty and oxidative stress effects of valerian root extract were evaluated in human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (Hepg2) and human colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco2) cell lines. The cytotoxicity was evaluated via the 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide test. Total reactive oxygen species analysis was performed via a 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate assay in flow cytometry. RESULTS: Inhibition concentration 50 values were calculated as 936.6 and 1097.5 µg/mL in the Hepg2 and Caco2 cell lines, respectively. It was observed that valerian root extract did not induce oxidative stress in HepG2 and Caco2 cell lines. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the use of valerian root extract as an alternative method in cancer treatment may not be effective and may cause a risk for public health. On the other hand, it may be safe at recommended tolerated concentrations since it does not cause oxidative stress."

      "abstract": "Maternal anxiety symptoms in the perinatal period might have long-term health effects on both the mother and the developing child. Valerian is a phytotherapeutic agent that is widely used for the treatment of anxiety. This study investigated the effects of valerian treatment in postpartum rats on maternal care, toxicity, and milk composition. Postnatal development, memory, and anxiety behavior in the offspring were also assessed. Postpartum Wistar rats received the valerian (500, 1000, or 2000 mg·kg-1·day-1) by oral gavage. Clinical and biochemical toxicity was evaluated with commercial kits. Maternal behavior was observed daily. Milk composition was analyzed by colorimetric methods. Physical and neuromotor tests were used to analyze postnatal development. Anxiolytic activity was assessed by the elevated plus maze, and memory was evaluated by the step-down inhibitory avoidance task. Maternal toxicity and care behavior were not altered by the treatment, while only the highest dose promoted a significant increase of lactose, and the doses 1000 and 2000 mg·kg-1·day-1 promoted a reduction of protein contents in milk. Postnatal development was similar in all offspring. Adult offspring did not display altered anxiety behavior, while long-term memory was impaired in the female adult offspring by maternal treatment with 1000 mg·kg-1·day-1. These results suggested that high doses of valerian had significant effects on important maternal milk components and can cause long-term alterations of offspring memory; thus, treatment with high doses of valerian is not safe for breastfeeding Wistar rat mothers.",

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Fifty-three adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients (according to ICU Confusion Assessment Method scores) who were treated for delirium received quetiapine and Neurogol syrup (a combination of valerian and lemon balm) or placebo 5 mL every 12 hours for five consecutive days. Improvement in agitation according to the Richmond Sedation and Restlessness Scale was considered the main outcome. RESULTS: The trial was completed for 53 patients (27 in the treatment group and 26 in the placebo group). The baseline characteristics between the groups were similar. In the treatment group, the number of agitated patients was significantly reduced and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.000). Compared with the placebo group, the length of ICU stay in the treatment group was significantly reduced (p = 0.001). The Glasgow Coma Scale improved significantly at the end of day 5 (p = 0.04). There was no statistical difference in the improvement of delirium between the study groups (p = 0.14). Neurogol syrup was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The addition of Neurogol to quetiapine (a combination of valerian and lemon balm) can reduce agitation and shorten the length of stay in the ICU without adverse effects. Clearly, more research is still needed to investigate the role of herbal medicines in ICUs and their efficacy and safety. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Alikiaie B, Shahmoradi E, Yekdaneh A, Mousavi S.

METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial was conducted on 39 patients undergoing HD allocated into a valerian and placebo group. In the first phase of the study, group A (n = 19) received valerian and group B (n = 20) received a placebo one hour before sleep every night for a total of one month. Sleep quality, state anxiety, and depression were assessed in the patients at the beginning and end of the intervention using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory. In the second phase, the two groups' treatment regimen was swapped. After a one-month washout period, the same process was repeated on the crossover groups (i.e., group A received placebo and group B received valerian). RESULTS: In the first phase, the mean sleep quality, depression, and state anxiety scores showed significant reductions in both groups, but the reduction was significantly higher in group A compared to group B (7.6 vs. 3.2, p< 0.001; 6.5 vs. 2.3, p =0.013; 14.6 vs. 7.3, p =0.003, respectively). In the second phase, the mean sleep disorder, depression, and state anxiety scores showed significant reductions in both groups, but the reduction was significantly lower in group A compared to group B (1.4 vs. 4.6, p< 0.001; 1.2 vs. 3.8, p =0.002; 1.5 vs. 6.2, p< 0.001, respectively).

      "abstract": "Valerian root (Valeriana officinalis) is a popular and widely available herbal supplement used to treat sleeping disorders and insomnia. The herb's ability to ameliorate sleep dysfunction may signify an unexplored anti-tumorigenic effect due to the connection between circadian factors and tumorigenesis. Of particular interest are the structural similarities shared between valeric acid, valerian's active chemical ingredient, and certain histone deacteylase (HDAC) inhibitors, which imply that valerian may play a role in epigenetic gene regulation. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the circadian-related herb valerian can inhibit breast cancer cell growth and explored epigenetic changes associated with valeric acid treatment. Our results showed that aqueous valerian extract reduced growth of breast cancer cells. In addition, treatment of valeric acid was associated with decreased breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, colony formation and 3D formation in vitro in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as well as reduced HDAC activity and a global DNA hypomethylation. Overall, these findings demonstrate that valeric acid can decrease the breast cancer cell proliferation possibly by mediating epigenetic modifications such as the inhibition of histone deacetylases and alterations of DNA methylation. This study highlights a potential utility of valeric acid as a novel HDAC inhibitor and a therapeutic agent in the treatment of breast cancer.",

The valerian group received 530 mg of valerian capsules for 30 nights after CABG surgery, and the placebo group received 530 mg of the placebo capsules containing wheat flour. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were assessed on four occasions, including the baseline, the 3rd, 14th and 30th days following intervention. RESULTS: The odds ratio of worsened sleep quality significantly varied over time (the interaction of time and group) in the valerian group compared to the placebo group in various dimensions including total sleep quality (P=0.001), sleep latency (P<0.01), sleep duration (P=0.020), sleep efficiency (P=0.001) and daytime dysfunction (P=0.025). No significant difference was observed in the alterations of the odds ratio of PT in the two groups over time. (P=0.371).

Seedlings were grown in nutrient solutions with three different concentrations of phosphate (900, 1200, and 1500 μM) for two weeks, then exposed for 4 days to 10 μM Cd, either in presence or absence of 400 μM methionine. The Met treatment decreased root Cd accumulation by up to 40%, while it enhanced Cd uptake into the shoots by 50%. In absence of Met, shoot Cd uptake was not affected by the level of phosphate application, although root Cd contents increased. The latter effect was entirely due to increased apoplastic Cd binding. In presence of Met, the Cd accumulation of both plant parts showed trends to increase with increasing phosphate level. In contrast to the treatments without Met, however, the phosphate effect on root Cd was due to increased symplastic root Cd allocation. The results suggest that the effects of Met on Cd uptake were due to the formation of mobile Cd-Met complexes, reducing phosphate-promoted Cd-retention in the apoplast and enhancing Cd transfer into the root symplast. Irrespective of the treatment, shoot Cd accumulation showed a close linear relationship to shoot mass, suggesting that convective transport with the transpirational water stream was the rate-governing uptake process. The results indicate that methionine supplementation could reduce Cd accumulation in valerian roots, which are the parts of this plant harvested for medicinal purposes, in Cd-contaminated soil, while phosphate would enhance it.",

Valerian (Valeriana officinalis L.) is a popular herbal medicine used as a sleep aid, however the outcomes of previous clinical studies are inconsistent. This study was conducted to update and re-evaluate the available data in order to understand the reason behind the inconsistent outcomes and to provide a broader view of the use of valerian for associated disorders. PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library were searched to retrieve publications relevant to the effectiveness of valerian as a treatment of sleep problems and associated disorders. A total of 60 studies (n=6,894) were included in this review, and meta-analyses were performed to evaluate the effectiveness to improve subjective sleep quality (10 studies, n=1,065) and to reduce anxiety (8 studies, n=535). Results suggested that inconsistent outcomes were possibly due to the variable quality of herbal extracts and that more reliable effects could be expected from the whole root/rhizome. In addition, therapeutic benefits could be optimized when it was combined with appropriate herbal partners. There were no severe adverse events associated with valerian intake in subjects aged between 7 and 80 years. In conclusion, valerian could be a safe and effective herb to promote sleep and prevent associated disorders. However, due to the presence of multiple active constituents and relatively unstable nature of some of the active constituents, it may be necessary to revise the quality control processes, including standardization methods and shelf life.",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the prescription of a fixed herbal extract combination of valerian, lemon balm, passionflower, and butterbur (Ze 185) changes the prescription pattern of benzodiazepines in hospitalized psychiatric patients. In a retrospective case-control study, anonymized medical record data from 3,252 psychiatric in-house patients were analysed over a 3.5-year period. Cases (n = 1,548) with a prescription of Ze 185 and controls (n = 1,704) were matched by age, gender, hospitalization interval, and main International Classification of Diseases, Version 10 F-diagnoses. The primary objective was to investigate the effect of Ze 185 on the prescription pattern of benzodiazepines. Secondary objectives investigated the prescriptions of concomitant drugs and effectiveness of the hospital stay. Distribution of drug classes was analysed using the WHO's anatomic-therapeutic-chemical code. Data showed that both treatment modalities had a comparable clinical effectiveness but with significantly less prescriptions of benzodiazepines in the Ze 185 group (p = .006). This is of clinical importance because suitable alternatives to benzodiazepines are desirable. To obtain more support for this hypothesis, a dedicated randomized, controlled clinical trial monitoring drug safety is required.",

METHODS: This crossover, double-blind clinical trial was conducted on 39 hemodialysis patients. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group A (n = 19) took Valerian capsules and Group B (n = 20) received placebo capsules 60 min before bedtime for one month. The type of treatment was replaced between the two groups after a one-month wash-out. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) questionnaire was completed and EGG was performed before and after intervention in both periods. RESULTS: The cognitive scores of the Group valerian were increased significantly in the first (p = 0.003) and the second (p = 0.005) periods.

More recently, melatonin, valerian and, in Switzerland, clomethiazol are widely considered as effective and more suitable alternatives for aged people. We present a systematic review of the literature on the efficacy and tolerance of these molecules, of which the main objective is to demonstrate that non-pharmacological approach must remain the first-line therapy of insomnia in geriatrics.",

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of valerian in preventing neuropsychiatric adverse effects of efavirenz in HIV-positive patients. METHOD: In this pilot randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, clinical trial, 51 HIV-positive patients who were receiving efavirenz were recruited into the valerian (n = 25) or placebo (n = 26) group. Patients received valerian (530 mg) or placebo nightly 1 hour before sleep for 4 weeks. The neuropsychiatric status (sleep, anxiety, depression, suicidal thought, and psychosis) of patients was assessed at baseline and week 4 using validated questionnaires. RESULTS: Sleep ( P ≤ 0.001) and anxiety ( P = 0.001) significantly improved in the valerian group compared with the placebo group. Dizziness was the most common complaint of patients in first days of the intervention. In the valerian and placebo groups, 92% and 84.6% of patients experienced dizziness, respectively ( P = 0.35). Nausea was the second common adverse effect that 84% and 76.9% of patients in the valerian and placebo groups experienced ( P = 0.39). CONCLUSION: In the first 4 weeks of ART including efavirenz, valerian significantly improved sleep and anxiety in HIV-positive patients. Valerian may be considered as a potential option in preventing neuropsychiatric adverse effects of efavirenz in HIV-positive patients.",

In this double-blind clinical trial, 100 female students of Islamic Azad University, Tonekabon Branch, Mazandaran Province, Iran, with PMS were randomly divided into groups receiving Valerian (scientific name: Valeriana officinalis) and placebo in 2013. The participants received 2 pills daily in the last seven days of their menstrual cycle for 3 cycles and recorded their symptoms. The data collection tools included demographic information questionnaire, daily symptom severity questionnaire, and a provisional diagnosis of premenstrual syndrome questionnaire. Data were compared previous, one, two, and three cycles after student's intervention using and analyzed by independent t-test, paired t-test, chi-squared test, and repeated measures ANOVA in SPSS 16. A significant difference was seen in mean emotional, behavioral and physical premenstrual symptom severity in the intervention group before and after the intervention (P < 0.001). However, this difference was not statistically significant in the control group. The results of this study showed that Valerian root extract may reduce emotional, physical, and behavioral symptoms of premenstrual syndrome."

A robust and inexpensive in vivo system allowing systematic screening would be critical to exploiting this knowledge. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to establish a cheap and accurate screening method which can be used for testing psychoactive efficacy of complex mixtures of unknown composition, like plant crude extracts. METHODS: We used automated recording of zebrafish larval swimming behavior during light vs. dark periods which we reproducibly altered with an anxiogenic compound, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). First, we reversed this PTZ-altered swimming by co-treatment with a well-defined synthetic anxiolytic drug, valproic acid (VPA). Next, we aimed at reversing it by adding crude root extracts of Valeriana officinalis (Val) from which VPA was originally derived. Finally, we assessed how expression of neural activity-regulated genes (c-fos, npas4a, and bdnf) known to be upregulated by PTZ treatment was affected in the presence of Val. RESULTS: Both VPA and Val significantly reversed the PTZ-altered swimming behaviors. Noticeably, Val at higher doses was affecting swimming independently of the presence of PTZ. A strong regulation of all three neural-activity genes was observed in Val-treated larvae which fully supported the behavioral results. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated in a combined behavioral-molecular approach the strong psychoactivity of a natural extract of unknown composition made from V. officinalis. Our results highlight the efficacy and sensitivity of such an approach, therefore offering a novel in vivo screening system amenable to high-throughput testing of promising ethnobotanical candidates.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The availability of herbal medicines over-the-counter (OTC) has increased the use of natural products for self-treatment. Valerian has been used to effectively treat generalized anxiety disorder and insomnia. Studies suggest that valerenic acid may increase gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulation in the brain. Benzodiazepines have a similar mechanism of action and have been linked to an increased risk of hospitalizations due to traffic accidents. Despite the risk of somnolence, the safety of driving while under the influence of valerian remains unknown. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of a one-time valerian 1600mg dose on subjective sedation effects, standardized field sobriety testing (SFST) and driving simulator performance parameters. METHODS: The study design was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial. For each session, participants received either a dose of valerian or placebo. The outcome measures included a simple visual reaction test (SVRT), subjective sleepiness scales, SFST performance scores, and driving simulator performance parameters. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the SVRT or sleepiness scales between placebo and valerian exposures, but the study may have been underpowered. SFST total and individual test failure rates were not significantly different between the two exposures. The driving simulator performance parameters were equivalent between the two exposure conditions. CONCLUSIONS: A one-time valerian 1600mg dose, often used to treat insomnia, does not appear to impair driving simulator performance after acute ingestion.",

OBJECTIVES: This work looks at the application of one-dimensional diffusion-edited (1)H-NMR spectroscopy (1D DOSY) and (1)H-NMR with suppression of the ethanol and water signals to the characterisation of quality and stability markers in multi-component herbal medicines/food supplements. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The experiments were performed with commercial tinctures of Valeriana officinalis L. (valerian), expired and non-expired, as well as its combination with Hummulus lupulus L. (hops), which is one of the most popular blends of relaxant herbs. These techniques did not require purification or evaporation of components for the qualitative analysis of the mixture, but only the addition of D2 O and TSP. RESULTS: The best diagnostic signals were found at δ 7 ppm (H-11, valerenic acid), δ 4.2 ppm (H-1, hydroxyvalerenic acid) and δ 1.5-1.8 ppm (methyl groups in prenylated moieties, α-acids/prenylated flavones). CONCLUSION: This work concludes on the potential value of 1D DOSY (1)H-NMR to provide additional assurance of quality in complex natural mixtures.",

This study was conducted on 90 patients with ACS in Mazandaran Heart Center (Sari, Iran) during 2013. The patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Patients in the acupressure with valerian oil 2.5% group (i.e., valerian acupressure group) received bilateral acupoint ( xué wèi) massage with two drops of valerian oil for 2 minutes for three nights; including every point this treatment lasted in total 18 minutes. Patients in the acupressure group received massage at the same points with the same technique but without valerian oil. Patients in the control group received massage at points that were 1-1.5 cm from the main points using the same technique and for the same length of time. The quality and quantity of the patients' sleep was measured by the St. Mary's Hospital Sleep Questionnaire (SMHSQ). After the intervention, there was a significant difference between sleep quality and sleep quantity in the patients in the valerian acupressure group and the acupressure group, compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Patients that received acupressure with valerian oil experienced improved sleep quality; however, this difference was not statistically significant in comparison to the acupressure only group. Acupressure at the ear spirit gate ( shén mén), hand Shenmen, glabella ( yìn táng), Wind Pool ( fēng chí), and Gushing Spring ( yǒng quán) acupoints can have therapeutic effects and may improve the quality and quantity of sleep in patients with ACS. Using these techniques in combination with herbal medicines such valerian oil can have a greater impact on improving sleep and reducing waking during the night."

      "abstract": "Valerian is widely used as a traditional medicine to improve the quality of sleep due to interaction of several active components with the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor (GABA(A)R) system. Recently, activation of GABA signaling in stem cells has been reported to suppress cell cycle progression in vivo. Furthermore, possible inhibitory effects of GABA(A)R agonists on hepatocarcinogenesis have been reported. The present study was performed to investigate modulating effects of Valerian on hepatocarcinogenesis using a medium-term rat liver bioassay. Male F344 rats were treated with one of the most powerful Valerian species (Valeriana sitchensis) at doses of 0, 50, 500 and 5000 ppm in their drinking water after initiation of hepatocarcinogenesis with diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Formation of glutathione S-transferase placental form positive (GST-P(+)) foci was significantly inhibited by Valerian at all applied doses compared with DEN initiation control rats. Generation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine in the rat liver was significantly suppressed by all doses of Valerian, likely due to suppression of Nrf2, CYP7A1 and induction of catalase expression. Cell proliferation was significantly inhibited, while apoptosis was induced in areas of GST-P(+) foci of Valerian groups associated with suppression of c-myc, Mafb, cyclin D1 and induction of p21(Waf1/Cip1), p53 and Bax mRNA expression. Interestingly, expression of the GABA(A)R alpha 1 subunit was observed in GST-P(+) foci of DEN control rats, with significant elevation associated with Valerian treatment. These results indicate that Valerian exhibits inhibitory effects on rat hepatocarcinogenesis by inhibiting oxidative DNA damage, suppressing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis in GST-P(+) foci by activating GABA(A)R-mediated signaling.",

The fumigant toxicity of oriental sweetgum and valerian oil differed significantly according to exposure time. Oriental sweetgum showed toxicity at short exposure times (2 days), and the toxicity of valerian oil was high 7 days after treatment. The main constituents of oriental sweetgum and valerian oils were tested individually for their fumigant toxicity against Japanese termites. Among the test compounds, benzyl alcohol, acetophenone, 1-phenyl-1-ethanol, hydrocinnamyl alcohol, trans-cinnamyl aldehyde, trans-cinnamyl alcohol, cis-asarone, styrene, and cis-ocimene showed toxicity against Japanese termites 7 days after treatment. Hydrocinnamyl alcohol and trans-cinnamyl alcohol were found to be the major contributors to the fumigant antitermitic toxicity of oriental sweetgum oil. The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition activity of two oils and their constituents was tested to determine their mode of action. Only cis-ocimene showed strong AChE inhibition activity with an IC50 value of 0.131 mg/mL. Further studies are warranted to determine the potential of these essential oils and their constituents as fumigants for termite control.",

This activity is closely related to valerenic acid. In the present experiments it was investigated whether acetoxy valerenic acid may interfere with the anxiolytic action of valerenic acid. METHODS: Situational anxiety was measured using male CD-1 mice in the elevated plus maze test after oral administration of the test substances. In addition the body core temperature was measured. For the 3H-GABA binding assay dissected tissue from frontal cortex of male RjHan:WI rats were used. Statistical evaluation was performed by means of the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallies H-test, followed by the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: Adding of acetoxy valerenic acid abolished the anxiolytic action of valerenic acid. There was no effect on body core temperature. Moreover, the valerian extract did not show any affinity to benzodiazepine binding sites. CONCLUSION: The determining compound for the observed anxiolytic effect of the valerian extract is its content of valerenic acid.",

We now examined whether treatment with a fixed combination of both may also improve concentration, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. METHODS: 169 primary school children suffering from hyperactivity and concentration difficulties but not meeting ADHS criteria were treated in an observational study by 27 office based pediatricians with a recommended daily dose of 640 mg valerian root extract WS(®) 1014 and 320 mg lemon balm extract WS(®) 1303 (Sandrin(®)), and evaluated by pediatricians and parents using standardized questionnaires at baseline, weeks 2 and 7. RESULTS: The fraction of children having strong/very strong symptoms of poor ability to focus decreased from 75% to 14%, hyperactivity from 61% to 13%, and impulsiveness from 59% to 22%. Parent rated social behavior, sleep and symptom burden showed highly significant improvements. Only in two children mild transient adverse drug reactions were observed. CONCLUSION: In primary school children with restlessness, concentration difficulties and impulsiveness treatment with WS(®) 1014 and WS(®) 1303 (Sandrin(®)) provides a viable option in addition to counseling and education.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of Valerian on hot flashes in menopausal women. In this double blind clinical trial, 68 menopausal women with the chief complaint of hot flash were enrolled using sampling at hand and were randomly divided into drug and placebo groups. The women in the drug group were prescribed 255 mg Valerian capsules 3 times a day for 8 weeks. The women in the placebo group were prescribed identical capsules filled with starch. Then, severity and frequency of hot flashes were measured and recorded through questionnaires and information forms in three levels (2 weeks before, four and eight weeks after the treatment). The Severity of hot flashes revealed a meaningful statistical difference pre- and post- Valerian treatment (p <0.001) while this difference was not meaningful in the placebo group. Further, the comparison of the two groups regarding the severity of hot flash after the treatment showed a meaningful statistical difference (p <0.001). Valerian has also led to a reduction of hot flash frequencies 4 and 8 weeks after the treatment (p <0.001) but this difference was not meaningful in drug like group. Valerian can be effective in treatment of menopausal hot flash and that it can be considered as a treatment of choice for reduction of hot flashes among the women who are reluctant to receive hormone therapy due to fear or any other reason."

      "abstract": "Valerian is one of the most commonly used herbal remedies for the treatment of insomnia and anxiety. Valerian extracts allosterically modulate GABAA receptors, an action related to valerenic acid, which is one of the active compounds determined from pharmacological studies. Derivatives of valerenic acid, i.e. acetoxy valerenic acid or hydroxy valerenic acid, do not allosterically modulate GABAA receptors, but they bind to identical binding sites. Therefore, the question arises whether they might interfere with the effects of valerenic acid. Two valerian extracts were tested in the elevated plus maze test and the tail suspension test for anxiolytic and antidepressive activity, respectively. Reference substances were diazepam (1.0mg/kg) and imipramine (30mg/kg). The extracts were standardized to the identical total amounts of the acids (0.1; 0.5; 1.0 and 2.0mg/kg), i.e. valerenic and acetoxy valerenic acid, but the ratio between the acids was different (12:1 and 1:1.5). The extract with the ratio 12:1 prolonged the time spent on the open arm significantly when 0.5mg/kg was applied. Of the other extract, with the ratio 1:1.5, four times that amount was required (2.0mg/kg). Both of the tested extracts did not show any antidepressive effect, rather the other way around, the extract with the ratio 1:1.5 prolonged the immobility phase. However, since the core body temperature was reduced by the 1.0 and 2.0mg/kg extract dose, the prolongation may be related to the temperature phenomenon and is not indicative of a specific depressive action. In conclusion, the anxiolytic activity of the valerian extract seems rather related to valerenic acid and, moreover, standardization with respect to the total amount of valerenic acids, i.e. valerenic acid together with acetoxy valerenic acid, is misleading.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders and sleep problems are common in the general population and are a cause of frequent consultations in primary care. These problems have significant impact on quality of life and functionality of individuals. The extracts of valerian root have been widely used for a long time by the population and physicians, for their sedative effects, hypnotic and anxiolytic. It is therefore urgent to know what are the benefits and the risks of using this substance for the treatment of anxiety and sleep disorders. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of valerian for the treatment of anxiety and sleep disorders. METHODS: A research was carried out for clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews (SR), meta-analysis (MA) and randomized controlled trials (RCT) in Pubmed, sites of evidence-based medicine and Índex das Revistas Médicas Portuguesas using the MeSH terms valerian, anxiety and sleep disorders, and respective DeCS, analyzing articles in English, Spanish, French or Portuguese, published between January 2000 and March 31, 2010. We also reviewed references of relevant articles. We used the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) from American Family Physician to evaluate the level of evidence and assigning the strength of a recommendation. RESULTS: We found 173 articles of which four were selected which met the inclusion criteria: a meta-analysis, a SR and a RCT concerning the use of valerian in sleep disorders, and an SR on the use of valerian in anxiety disorders. The evidence is insufficient regarding the efficacy of valerian in the treatment of anxiety disorders (SOR A). There seems to be some evidence of the effectiveness of valerian for treating insomnia, which is limited by the quality of existing studies (SOR B). Valerian root is well tolerated and safe, with infrequent and benign side effects (SOR A). DISCUSSION: The evidence is currently insufficient to recommend the use of valerian for the treatment of anxiety disorders. The evidence in insomnia is limited by the contradictory results of studies reviewed and their methodological problems, although it seems to have some effect in mild to moderate insomnia. Despite that, valerian is a safe substance. More RCT are needed, with samples of adequate size, with standardization of measures to assess quality of sleep and levels of anxiety and standardization of dose, type of preparation of valerian used and the time for its use.",

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore the effectiveness of valerian acupressure on the sleep of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). DESIGN: A randomized clinical trial. SETTING: A 42-bed adult intensive care unit. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-one subjects in the experimental group and 44 subjects in the control group. METHODS: The measurement included observation, and actigraphy measures during 10 pm-6 am, and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) measures on the next morning. Experimental groups received valerian acupressure on the Shenmen, Neiguan, and Yongquan acupoints between 7 pm and 10 pm of the second day while control groups received regular treatment. Heart rate was measured for 5 min before and after valerian acupressure present for HR variability analysis to measure relaxation response. RESULTS: The results indicated that after receiving valerian acupressure, patients' sleeping hours increased, wake frequency reduced and SSS grades declined. The HR variability data indicated relaxation response immediately after valerian acupressure.

RESULTS: The pain severity at baseline did not differ significantly between the groups. After the intervention, the pain severity was significantly reduced in both groups (P<0.001), but the extent of the reduction was larger in the valerian group, with the difference between the 2 groups being statistically significant (P<0.05). The total scores of the systemic manifestations associated with dysmenorrhea decreased after the intervention, but there was no significant difference between the groups, with the exception for syncope (P<0.05).

Complementary and alternative medical therapies may be useful for the management of sleep disturbances among postmenopausal women. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of valerian extract taken nightly on the improvement of sleep quality in postmenopausal women experiencing insomnia. METHODS: A randomized, triple-blind, controlled trial design was used for this study. Participants consisted of 100 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 60 years who were experiencing insomnia. A demographic data form and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were used to collect data. The women were randomly divided into two groups. Each group received either 530 mg of concentrated valerian extract or a placebo twice a day for 4 weeks. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A statistically significant change was reported in the quality of sleep of the intervention group in comparison with the placebo group (P < 0.001). Also, 30% of the participants in the intervention group and 4% in the placebo group showed an improvement in the quality of sleep (P < 0.001).

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are a substantial problem for cancer survivors, with prevalence estimates ranging from 23% to 61%. Although numerous prescription hypnotics are available, few are approved for long-term use or have demonstrated benefit in this circumstance. Hypnotics may have unwanted side effects and are costly, and cancer survivors often wish to avoid prescription drugs. New options with limited side effects are needed. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of a Valerian officinalis supplement for sleep in people with cancer who were undergoing cancer treatment. Participants were randomized to receive 450 mg of valerian-or placebo orally 1 hour before bedtime for 8 weeks. The primary end point was area under the curve (AUC) of the overall Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Secondary outcomes included the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Toxicity was evaluated with both self-reported numeric analogue scale questions and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. A total of 227 patients were randomized into this study between March 19, 2004, and March 9, 2007, with 119 being evaluable for the primary end point. The AUC over the 8 weeks for valerian was 51.4 (SD = 16), while that for placebo was 49.7 (SD = 15), with a P value of 0.6957. A supplemental, exploratory analysis revealed that several fatigue end points, as measured by the BFI and POMS, were significantly better for those taking valerian over placebo. Participants also reported less trouble with sleep and less drowsiness on valerian than placebo. There were no significant differences in toxicities as measured by self-report or the CTCAE except for mild alkaline phosphatase increases, which were slightly more common in the placebo group. This study failed to provide data to support the hypothesis that valerian, 450 mg, at bedtime could improve sleep as measured by the PSQI. However, exploratory analyses revealed improvement in some secondary outcomes, such as fatigue. Further research with valerian exploring physiologic effects in oncology symptom management may be warranted.",

Many herbs with psychotropic effects exist which can have fewer side effects compared to more conventional medications. Valeriana Officinalis L. is a well-known medicinal plant with a long history of usage in the world with an effect on GABA. This plant is reported to be safe on humans. Our objective in this study was to compare the efficacy of the extract of Valeriana Officinalis L. with placebo in the treatment of OCD. METHODS: The study was an 8-week pilot double-blind randomized trial. Thirty-one adult outpatients who met the DSM-IV-TR criteria for OCD based on the structured clinical interview participated in the trial. In this double-blind and randomized trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive either capsule of the extract (765 mg/day) or placebo (30 mg/day) for 8 weeks. RESULTS: The results showed significant difference between the extract and placebo in the end of treatment (P=0.000). Somnolence was the only significant difference between the two groups in terms of observed side effects (P=0.02). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that Valeriana Officinalis L. has some antiobsessive and compulsive effects. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings. Psychiatrists often find that many patients cannot tolerate the side effects of psychiatry medicine Valeriana Officinalis L. is a well-known medicinal plant with a long history of usage in world with effect on GABA.The results showed significant difference between the extract and placebo in the treatment of OCD.

      "abstract": "Valeriana officinalis L. is a popular herbal treatment for mild sleep disorders. Clinical and non-clinical studies found contradictory results for valerian extracts and single constituents regarding the influence on sleep parameters. It was the aim of this study to investigate the sedative effects of a valerian root extract. Therefore, locomotor activity and core body temperature were recorded in male mice using radiotelemetry. A 70 % ethanolic extract prepared from the roots of V. officinalis (s. l.) and some of its single constituents, valerenic acid, linarin, and apigenin, were tested for effects on locomotion and body temperature over 180 minutes after oral administration. The extract was tested in a dose range of 250-1000 mg/kg, and only a dose of 1000 mg/kg valerian extract showed a mild short-term sedative effect with reduced locomotor activity between 66-78 min minutes after administration. Paradoxically, an increased activity was observed after 150 minutes after gavage. A dose of 1 mg/kg valerenic acid produced an intermittent stimulation of activity. However, a mild short-term sedative effect was found for linarin at 12 mg/kg and apigenin at 1.5 mg/kg. Considering the cumulative locomotor activity over the observation period of 180 min, it is concluded that neither the extract nor one of the compounds had considerable sedative effects. More precisely, the observed short-term changes in activity pattern indicate that valerian extract as well as the flavonoids linarin and apigenin are rather effective to reduce sleep latency than to act as a sleep-maintaining agent.",

Studies were included if they evaluated the efficacy of valerian or hops in improving primary insomnia in adults: sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Twelve of these found that the use of valerian, on its own, or in combination with hops, is associated with improvements in some sleep parameters (eg. sleep latency and quality of sleep). However, these results need to be interpreted cautiously as there were significant differences in design between the studies. CONCLUSION: Further randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trials are needed before such herbal treatments can be confidently recommended for the treatment of primary insomnia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insomnia is an often seen primary health care problem. Valerian might be an alternative treatment with fewer secondary effects. The aim of this study is to evaluate its effectiveness on insomnia through a meta-analysis of published literature. METHODS: Search for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of Valerian preparations compared with a placebo on Medline, the Cochrane Library, Embase and Biosis. OUTCOMES: sleep-quality improvement (SQ, yes/no), sleep-quality improvement quantified through visual analogical scales (SQS) and the latency time (LT) in minutes until getting to sleep. Three meta-analyses were carried out using inverse-variance weighted random effects models. Heterogeneity was determined with the Q-statistic and was explored through a sub-groups analysis. Publication bias was evaluated using the funnel plot. RESULTS: Eighteen RCTs were selected; eight had a score of 5 on Jadad's scale. The mean differences in LT between the Valerian and placebo treatment groups was 0.70 min (95% CI, -3.44 to 4.83); the standardized mean differences between the groups measured with SQS was -0.02 (95% CI, -0.35 to 0.31); treatment with Valerian showed a relative risk of SQ of 1.37 (95% CI, 1.05-1.78) compared with the placebo group. There was heterogeneity in the three meta-analyses, but it diminished in the sub groups analysis. No publication bias was detected. CONCLUSION: The qualitative dichotomous results suggest that valerian would be effective for a subjective improvement of insomnia, although its effectiveness has not been demonstrated with quantitative or objective measurements. We recommend future investigations oriented toward improving insomnia with other more promising treatments.",

      "abstract": "Mild anxieties, nervousness, and restlessness are common in the general population and are commonly treated by complementary and alternative medical (CAM) therapies. A prospective, nonrandomized, noninterventional, observational study, using conventional or CAM practices, was conducted in 49 German practices. Each practice could include up to 15 subjects treated with either the homeopathic preparation Neurexan or with combination formulations based on valerian extracts. There was no placebo group. Choice and doses of study therapies were at the respective physician's discretion. The planned treatment duration was 2 weeks. A total of 826 subjects were included in the study and 777 (553 Neurexan and 224 valerian) subjects were available for the final examination. Subjects receiving Neurexan tended to weigh less, to have fewer concomitant illnesses and slightly milder severity of nervousness/restlessness, and were likelier to be female than the subjects receiving valerian therapies. The summary score for nervousness/restlessness was reduced from 19.0 +/- 6.1 at baseline to 7.4 +/- 6.8 at the end of the observation period in the Neurexan group, a reduction of 11.5 +/- 7.3 score units. In the valerian group, the summary score was reduced from 21.4 +/- 6.0 to 12.6 +/- 7.3, a reduction of 9.0 +/- 6.6 score units. The changes from baseline and the differences between the groups were statistically significant. Similar significant differences in effects were seen on the subscores and on the subjects' assessments of effectiveness. Both study therapies were well tolerated. Neurexan appears to be an effective and well-tolerated alternative to valerian-based combination therapies for the treatment of nervousness/restlessness in subjects favorable towards a CAM-based therapy.",

METHODS: A prospective, triple-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design was used to compare the efficacy of valerian with placebo on sleep quality and symptom severity in patients with RLS. Thirty-seven participants were randomly assigned to receive 800 mg of valerian or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary outcome of sleep was sleep quality with secondary outcomes including sleepiness and RLS symptom severity. RESULTS: Data were collected at baseline and 8 weeks comparing use of valerian and placebo on sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and severity of RLS symptoms (International RLS Symptom Severity Scale) from 37 participants aged 36 to 65 years. Both groups reported improvement in RLS symptom severity and sleep. In a nested analysis comparing sleepy vs nonsleepy participants who received 800 mg ofvalerian (n=17), significant differences before and after treatment were found in sleepiness (P=.01) and RLS symptoms (P=.02). A strong positive association between changes in sleepiness and RLS symptom severity was found (P=.006). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the use of 800 mg of valerian for 8 weeks improves symptoms of RLS and decreases daytime sleepiness in patients that report an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score of 10 or greater. Valerian may be an alternative treatment for the symptom management ofRLS with positive health outcomes and improved quality of life.",

This investigation focuses on the question if a single administration can be an effective sleep aid. Two parallel groups of n = 20 (verum) and n = 22 (placebo) were tested. Each subject spent two consecutive nights in the lab (reference night and medication night). Medication consisted in giving verum or placebo to poor sleepers identified by a validated sleep questionnaire (Schlaffragebogen SF-B). Two ml of the liquid ex?tract or similar smelling placebo were diluted in 50 ml water (flavoured with honey) and administered 15 minutes before EEG recording during the medication night. The data analysis is based on the electrohypnogram - a method derived from a validated computer assisted automatic analysis for depth of sleep. Differences between the reference nights and medication nights were evaluated and tested for significance. Time spent in sleep (values of the sleep frequency index \"SFx\" of the electrohypnogram of 74% or lower) was significantly higher for the verum group in comparison to the placebo group (p<0.01). The difference with respect to time spent in deeper sleep (i.e. 68% and lower or 62% and lower) between reference and medication night was also statistically significant at p<0.01. This parameter correlated with the difference in quality of sleep between the two consecutive nights as derived from the sleep inventory SF-A sub-score (subjects evaluation) with r = 0.48 at p<0.0001. The EEG derived parameter \"sleep quantity\" as calculated from the electrohypnogram proved superiority of the valerian/hops combination over placebo. Thus, the present investigation has shown evidence that a valerian/hops fluid extract can be used successfully using a single administration.",

Participants took 300 mg of concentrated valerian extract or placebo 30 min before bedtime for 2 weeks. Sleep was assessed in the laboratory by self-report and polysomnography (PSG) at baseline and again at the beginning and end of each treatment phase (total of nine nights in the laboratory) and at home by daily sleep logs and actigraphy. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between valerian and placebo after a single dose or after 2 weeks of nightly dosing on any measure of sleep latency, wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep efficiency, and self-rated sleep quality. In comparing each treatment to baseline in separate comparisons, WASO significantly increased (+17.7+/-25.6 min, p=.02) after 2 weeks of nightly valerian, but not after placebo (+6.8+/-26.4 min, NS).

Valerian alone did not affect oxidative stress parameters in the liver or kidney of rats. HP alone only increased glutathione (GSH) depletion in liver, but not in kidney. However, when HP was associated with valerian, an increase in lipid peroxidation levels and dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) reactive species production was observed in the hepatic tissue. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT) activities were not affected by the HP plus valerian treatment in the liver and kidney of rats. HP and valerian when administered independently did not affect the activity of hepatic and renal delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase (delta-ALA-D), however, these drugs administered concomitantly provoked an inhibition of hepatic delta-ALA-D activity. The delta-ALA-D reactivation index was higher in rats treated with HP plus valerian than other treated groups. These results strengthen the view that delta-ALA-D can be considered a marker for oxidative stress. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity was not altered by any treatment. However, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity was higher in the HP group and HP plus valerian group. Our findings suggest adverse interactions between haloperidol and valerian.",

Here we report on an open-label, prospective cohort study in 89 German centers offering both conventional and complementary therapies. Subjects received the homeopathic preparation Neurexan or valerian for 28 days. Doses were at physicians' judgments. Sleep duration and latency were evaluated based on patients' sleep diaries over 14 days; sleep quality was evaluated at 28 +/- 1 days. A total of 409 subjects were enrolled. The groups were balanced at baseline for age, sex, weight, and sleep disturbances. At day 14, both groups reported improved sleep latency and duration; latency was reduced from baseline by 37.3 +/- 36.3 min with Neurexan and by 38.2 +/- 38.5 min with valerian. The duration of sleep increased by 2.2 (+/-1.6) h in the Neurexan group and by 2.0 (+/-1.5) h in the valerian group. Differences between the groups in improvement on sleep duration were significantly in favor of Neurexan therapy at days 8, 12, and 14. At day 28, quality of sleep was improved in both groups with no significant differences between the treatments. Significantly more patients reported lack of daytime fatigue with Neurexan than with valerian therapies (49% vs. 32%; p < 0.05 for the comparison). For patients favorable towards a CAM-based therapy, Neurexan might be an effective and well-tolerated alternative to conventional valerian-based therapies for the treatment of mild to moderate insomnia.",

METHODS: Seventy rats were divided into 7 groups: normal control, untreated, negative control, positive control, and low-, medium- and high-dose Valerian-treated groups. There were 10 rats in each group. Except for the normal control group, depression was induced in rats by chronic mild stress. The depressive rats in the other six groups were intragastrically administered with sodium carboxymethycellulose, fluoxetine, and low, medium and high-dose Valerian, respectively for 3 weeks. After the treatment, the proliferating cells in the hippocampus were labeled by injecting bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in 7 groups. The content of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the hippocampus was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the number of hippocampal neurons was counted by morphometry. RESULTS: Compared with the normal control group, the levels of 5-HT in the hippocampus in the low- and medium-dose Valerian-treated groups were increased and recovered to normal level. After the administration of low-dose Valerian for 3 weeks, the number of BrdU positive cells and neurons in the hippocampus of the depressive rats were recovered to the normal status. CONCLUSION: Minidose Valerian may promote the level of 5-HT and cell proliferation in the hippocampus of the depressive rats, and may play a role in saving injured neurons of the hippocampus.",

      "abstract": "Herbal use may be associated with increased morbidity and mortality as a consequence of interactions with anesthetic agents. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects on emergence from isoflurane anesthesia using a combination of the herb valerian and midazolam compared with valerian alone, midazolam alone, and no additional drug-herb treatment in Sprague-Dawley rats. We assigned 32 male Sprague-Dawley rats to 1 of 4 groups: (1) isoflurane alone, (2) isoflurane plus valerian, (3) isoflurane plus midazolam, and (4) isoflurane plus a combination of valerian and midazolam. Thirty minutes after treatment, animals underwent a standard laparotomy. The time in seconds from discontinuation of isoflurane to the time the animal righted itself and took I step was recorded as emergence time. A 1-way analysis of variance with a post hoc Scheffe procedure revealed that animals given a combination of midazolam and valerian took significantly longer to emerge from anesthesia (F = 58.21; P < .00) compared with all other groups. Awareness of possible interactions of herbals with conventional anesthetics is important so that potential problems may be recognized and treated. These data demonstrate the need for continued research concerning the effects of herbals and their potential for interaction with anesthetics.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This trial was conducted as part of a project that aims to enhance public understanding and use of research in decisions about healthcare by enabling viewers to participate in research and to follow the process, through television reports and on the web. Valerian is an herbal over-the-counter drug that is widely used for insomnia. Systematic reviews have found inconsistent and inconclusive results about its effects. METHODS: Participants were recruited through a weekly nationally televised health program in Norway. Enrolment and data collection were over the Internet. 405 participants who were 18 to 75 years old and had insomnia completed a two week diary-keeping run-in period without treatment and were randomised and mailed valerian or placebo tablets for two weeks. All participants and investigators were blind to treatment until after the analysis was completed. FINDINGS: For the primary outcome of a minimally important improvement in self-reported sleep quality (> or = 0.5 units on a 7 point scale), the difference between the valerian group (29%) and the placebo group (21%) was not statistically significant (difference 7.5%; 95% CI-0.9 to 15.9; p = 0.08). On the global self-assessment question at the end of the treatment period 5.5% (95% CI 0.2 to 10.8) more participants in the valerian group perceived their sleep as better or much better (p = 0.04). There were similar trends favouring the valerian group for night awakenings (difference = 6.0%, 95% CI-0.5 to 12.5) and sleep duration (difference = 7.5%, 95% CI-1.0 to 16.1). There were no serious adverse events and no important or statistically significant differences in minor adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Based on this and previous studies, valerian appears to be safe, but with modest beneficial effects at most on insomnia compared to placebo. The combined use of television and the Internet in randomised trials offers opportunities to answer questions about the effects of health care interventions and to improve public understanding and use of randomised trials.

      "abstract": "Valerian (Valeriana Officinallis) is a perennial plant used as a mild sedative for anxiety and for insomnia. It is also used in the treatment of gastrointestinal cramps and as a diuretic. It is traditionally contraindicated in pregnancy; however, there are no studies to warrant this warning. This study was performed to provide some information to fill this knowledge gap. Female rats were orally dosed with a valerian extract in 45% ethanol (supplied by MediHerb) daily on either gestation days (GD) 1-8 or 8-15. On GD 20, rats were sacrificed and fetuses, placentae and ovaries collected. The fetuses were weighed and examined for external malformations. No signs of maternal toxicity were evident. Results indicated that valerian had no adverse effects on fertility or fetal development. Valerian induced toxicity when GD 10.5 embryos were cultured for 26h in rat serum to which 6 microl/ml of the extract was added. The results of the present preliminary study showed that consumption of up to 65 times the human dose of the valerian extract supplied by Mediherb did not have an adverse reproductive outcome in rats. This may be a result of low pH of the extract removing the potentially cytotoxic epoxide moieties. However, consumption of other preparations of valerian, particularly if they contained considerable levels of valepotriates could have a very different outcome.",

The present clinical study aimed to demonstrate superiority of the fixed extract combination in comparison with placebo in patients suffering from non-organic insomnia (ICD 10, F 51.0-51.2). Objective sleep parameters were registered by means of a transportable home recorder system (QUISI). The primary outcome was the reduction in sleep latency (SL2) which had to be prolonged at baseline (>/=30 min) as an inclusion criteria. The treatment period lasted for 4 weeks with either placebo, single valerian extract (Ze 911) or the fixed valerian hops extract combination (Ze 91019). The amount of the single valerian extract was identical to that amount contained in the fixed extract combination, i.e. 500 mg valerian extract siccum. In the extract combination 120 mg hops extract siccum was added. Both the extracts were prepared with 45% methanol m/m with a drug-extract ratio of 5.3:1 (valerian) and 6.6:1 (hops), respectively. The fixed extract combination was significantly superior to the placebo in reducing the sleep latency whilst the single valerian extract failed to be superior to the placebo. The result underlined the plausibility for adding hops extract to the valerian extract.",

Extracts of the roots of valerian (Valeriana officinalis) are widely used for inducing sleep and improving sleep quality. A systematic review of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of valerian for improving sleep quality is presented. An extensive literature search identified 16 eligible studies examining a total of 1093 patients. Most studies had significant methodologic problems, and the valerian doses, preparations, and length of treatment varied considerably. A dichotomous outcome of sleep quality (improved or not) was reported by 6 studies and showed a statistically significant benefit (relative risk of improved sleep = 1.8, 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.9), but there was evidence of publication bias in this summary measure. The available evidence suggests that valerian might improve sleep quality without producing side effects. Future studies should assess a range of doses of standardized preparations of valerian and include standard measures of sleep quality and safety.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are very common mental health problems in the general population and in primary care settings. Herbal medicines are popular and used worldwide and might be considered as a treatment option for anxiety if shown to be effective and safe. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effectiveness and safety of valerian for treating anxiety disorders. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic searches: The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) searched on 04/08/2006, MEDLINE, Lilacs. References of all identified studies were inspected for additional studies. First authors of each included study, manufacturers of valerian products, and experts in the field were contacted for information regarding unpublished trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials of valerian extract of any dose, regime, or method of administration, for people with any primary diagnosis of general anxiety disorder, anxiety neurosis, chronic anxiety status, or any other disorder in which anxiety is the primary symptom (panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, social phobia, agoraphobia, other types of phobia, postraumatic stress disorder). Effectiveness was measured using clinical outcome measures and other scales for anxiety symptoms. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently applied inclusion criteria, extracted and entered data, and performed the trial quality assessments. Where disagreements occurred, the third review author was consulted. Methodological quality of included trials was assessed using Cochrane Handbook criteria. For dichotomous outcomes, relative risk (RR) was calculated, and for continuous outcomes, the weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated, with their respective 95% confidence intervals. MAIN RESULTS: One RCT involving 36 patients wih generalised anxiety disorder was eligible for inclusion. This was a 4 week pilot study of valerian, diazepam and placebo. There were no significant differences between the valerian and placebo groups in HAM-A total scores, or in somatic and psychic factor scores. Similarly, there were no significant differences in HAM-A scores between the valerian and diazepam groups, although based on STAI-Trait scores, significantly greater symptom improvement was indicated in the diazepam group. There were no significant differences between the three groups in the number of patients reporting side effects or in dropout rates. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Since only one small study is currently available, there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the efficacy or safety of valerian compared with placebo or diazepam for anxiety disorders. RCTs involving larger samples and comparing valerian with placebo or other interventions used to treat of anxiety disorders, such as antidepressants, are needed.",

      "abstract": "Valerian is widely known for its use as a sedative and an anti-anxiety drug in the folk medicine. Literature reports suggested valerian to induce genotoxicity in vitro (ECV304 cells) by reactive oxygen species-mediated mechanism; however, there are no reports on its genotoxicity and/or the epigenetic mechanism in vivo. In view of the folkloric significance, it was found worthwhile to (1) determine the genotoxic effects of valerian in somatic and germ cells of mice and (2) investigate the role of epigenetic mechanisms. The protocol included the oral treatment of mice with different doses (500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg/day) of valerian for 7 days. The following experiments were conducted: (i) cytological studies on micronucleus test, (ii) cytogenetic analysis for meiotic chromosomes, (iii) cytological analysis of spermatozoa abnormalities, (iv) quantification of proteins and nucleic acids in testicular cells and (v) estimation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nonprotein sulfhydryl (NP-SH) in hepatic and testicular cells. The treatment increased the frequency of micronuclei in the polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) and decrease the ratio of PCE to normochromatic erythrocytes (NCE) in the femur. It caused aberrations in chromosomes of the testis and induced spermatozoa abnormalities. The concentration of nucleic acids was depleted in the testicular cells. These changes might be attributed to the epigenetic mechanisms as revealed by an increase in the concentrations of MDA and a decrease of NP-SH levels in hepatic and testicular cells observed in the present study. The observed changes may be ascribed to terpenoids (valepotriates) and flavonoids (6-methylapigenin and 2S(-)-hesperidin) present in valerian.",

In total, 80.9% of the patients who suffered from dyssomnia experienced an improvement for this symptom and 70.4% of the patients with restlessness improved clearly. For the other listed symptoms the total improvement was 37.8% on average. Both, parents and investigators assessed efficacy as to be \"very good\" or \"good\" (60.5% and 67.7%, respectively). The tolerability of Euvegal forte was considered as \"good\" (in 96.7% of the patients it was judged to be \"very good\" or \"good\"). No study medication-related adverse events occurred. In conclusion, Euvegal forte was effective in the treatment of younger children with restlessness and dyssomnia and it was very well tolerated.",

Although it is often self-treated with herbal and dietary supplements or with over-the-counter sleep aids, there is still little evidence on the efficacy and safety of those products. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a valerian-hops combination and diphenhydramine for the treatment of mild insomnia. DESIGN AND SETTING: Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted in 9 sleep disorders centers throughout the United States. PATIENTS: A total of 184 adults (110 women, 74 men; mean age of 44.3 years) with mild insomnia. INTERVENTIONS: (1) Two nightly tablets of standardized extracts of a valerian (187-mg native extracts; 5-8:1, methanol 45% m/m) and hops (41.9-mg native extracts; 7-10:1, methanol 45% m/m) combination for 28 days (n = 59), (2) placebo for 28 days (n = 65), or (3) 2 tablets of diphenhydramine (25 mg) for 14 days followed by placebo for 14 days (n = 60). OUTCOME MEASURES: Sleep parameters measured by daily diaries and polysomnography, clinical outcome ratings from patients and physicians, and quality of life measures. RESULTS: Modest improvements of subjective sleep parameters were obtained with both the valerian-hops combination and diphenhydramine, but few group comparisons with placebo reached statistical significance. Valerian produced slightly greater, though nonsignificant, reductions of sleep latency relative to placebo and diphenhydramine at the end of 14 days of treatment and greater reductions than placebo at the end of 28 days of treatment. Diphenhydramine produced significantly greater increases in sleep efficiency and a trend for increased total sleep time relative to placebo during the first 14 days of treatment. There was no significant group difference on any of the sleep continuity variables measured by polysomnography. In addition, there was no alteration of sleep stages 3-4 and rapid eye movement sleep with any of the treatments. Patients in the valerian and diphenhydramine groups rated their insomnia severity lower relative to placebo at the end of 14 days of treatment. Quality of life (Physical component) was significantly more improved in the valerian-hops group relative to the placebo group at the end of 28 days. There were no significant residual effects and no serious adverse events with either valerian or diphenhydramine and no rebound insomnia following their discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show a modest hypnotic effect for a valerian-hops combination and diphenhydramine relative to placebo. Sleep improvements with a valerian-hops combination are associated with improved quality of life. Both treatments appear safe and did not produce rebound insomnia upon discontinuation during this study. Overall, these findings indicate that a valerian-hops combination and diphenhydramine might be useful adjuncts in the treatment of mild insomnia.",

      "abstract": "The two herbal extracts valerian (Valeriana officinalis L.) and St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) were studied for their metabolic changes upon incubation with freshly prepared rat hepatocytes and subsequently analysed phytochemically as well as pharmacologically in vitro. Quantitative HPLC analysis of valerian extracts revealed considerable metabolic activities with regard to sesquiterpenes and iridoids. The amount of acetoxyvalerenic acid decreased 9-fold, while that of hydroxyvalerenic acid correspondingly increased 9-fold due to O-deacetylation. The valepotriates didrovaltrate, isovaltrate and valtrate decreased 2-, 18- and 16-fold, respectively. However, the binding affinities of the incubated extracts to the benzodiazepine and picrotoxin binding site of the GABA (A) receptor were quite similar to those of the non-incubated extracts. Neither valerenic acids nor valepotriates exhibited any significant effect on the two binding sites when tested as single compounds. Therefore, either other constituents represent the active ones or multiple compounds are necessary for the observed inhibitory and allosteric effects at the GABA (A) receptor. Extracts of St. John's wort were less potently metabolised than valerian. The amount of pseudohypericin and the main flavonoids (hyperoside, rutin, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, quercetin and I3,II8-biapigenin) slightly decreased during the 4-h incubation period. Both the antagonist effect at the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) type 1 receptor and the binding inhibition at the 5-HT transporter were attenuated during the metabolic treatment. The reduced antagonist effect correlates with the decreasing amount of pseudohypericin known to be a CRF (1) receptor antagonist. In conclusion, the incubation of plant extracts with freshly prepared rat hepatocytes represents a useful approach to study the pharmacological action of metabolised plant extracts. The consistent pharmacological activity of both valerian and St. John's wort is concordant with the known clinical efficacy of pharmacological activities.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most frequently encountered sleep complaint worldwide. While many prescription drugs are used to treat insomnia, extracts of valerian (Valeriana officinalis L., Valerianaceae) are also used for the treatment of insomnia and restlessness. To determine novel mechanisms of action, radioligand binding studies were performed with valerian extracts (100% methanol, 50% methanol, dichloromethane [DCM], and petroleum ether [PE]) at the melatonin, glutamate, and GABA(A) receptors, and 8 serotonin receptor subtypes. Both DCM and PE extracts had strong binding affinity to the 5-HT(5a) receptor, but only weak binding affinity to the 5-HT(2b) and the serotonin transporter. Subsequent binding studies focused on the 5-HT(5a) receptor due to the distribution of this receptor in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain, which is implicated in the sleep-wake cycle. The PE extract inhibited [(3)H]lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) binding to the human 5-HT(5a) receptor (86% at 50 microg/ml) and the DCM extract inhibited LSD binding by 51%. Generation of an IC(50) curve for the PE extract produced a biphasic curve, thus GTP shift experiments were also performed. In the absence of GTP, the competition curve was biphasic (two affinity sites) with an IC(50) of 15.7 ng/ml for the high-affinity state and 27.7 microg/ml for the low-affinity state. The addition of GTP (100 microM) resulted in a right-hand shift of the binding curve with an IC(50) of 11.4 microg/ml. Valerenic acid, the active constituent of both extracts, had an IC(50) of 17.2 microM. These results indicate that valerian and valerenic acid are new partial agonists of the 5-HT(5a) receptor.",

METHODS: Review of available literature. RESULTS: In 1592, Fabio Colonna, in his botanical classic Phytobasanos, reported that taking powdered valerian root cured his own epilepsy. Subsequent reports of valerian's anticonvulsant effectiveness appeared. By the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it was often regarded as the best available treatment for the disorder. Valerian preparations yield isovaleric acid, a substance analogous to valproic acid and likely to possess anticonvulsant properties, as isovaleramide does. In favorable circumstances, high valerian doses can be calculated to have sometimes provided potentially effective amounts of anticonvulsant substance for epilepsy patients. CONCLUSIONS: Valerian probably did possess the potential for an anticonvulsant effect, but the uncertain chemical composition and content of valerian preparations, and their odor and taste, made it unlikely that they could ever prove satisfactory in widespread use.",

We reviewed the available literature on the use of valerian preparations in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Preclinical studies suggest that valerian has sedative and muscle-relaxant effects. Few clinical trials with valerian have been carried out in conditions other than insomnia. The insomnia studies have methodologic shortcomings but suggest that some preparations lead to significant subjective improvement in sleep complaints with remarkably few side effects. Furthermore, some evidence indicates that valerian preparations may have a mechanism of action and clinical characteristics that differ from the benzodiazepine-related sedative/hypnotics, making them more suitable for long-term use. If this safety profile and the plant's sedative/hypnotic efficacy are confirmed in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with carefully and consistently prepared valerian compounds, then those compounds would fill an important and presently unfilled niche in the treatment of insomnia."

      "abstract": "Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) is a popular dietary supplement. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of a valerian extract on the activity of the drug-metabolizing enzymes cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and 3A4. Probe drugs dextromethorphan (30 mg; CYP2D6 activity) and alprazolam (2 mg; CYP3A4 activity) were administered orally to healthy volunteers (n = 12) at baseline and again after exposure to two 500-mg valerian tablets (1000 mg) nightly for 14 days. The valerian supplement contained a total valerenic acid content of 5.51 mg/tablet. Dextromethorphan to dextorphan metabolic ratios (DMRs) and alprazolam pharmacokinetics were determined at baseline and after valerian treatment. The DMR was 0.214 +/- 0.025 at baseline and 0.254 +/- 0.026 after valerian supplementation (p > 0.05). For alprazolam, the maximum concentration in plasma was significantly increased after treatment with valerian (25 +/- 7 ng/ml versus 31 +/- 8 ng/ml; p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in other pharmacokinetic parameters at baseline and after valerian exposure (all p values > or = 0.05; time to reach maximum concentration in plasma, 3.0 +/- 3.2 versus 3.1 +/- 2.1 h; area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, 471 +/- 183 versus 539 +/- 240 hx ng x ml(-1); half-life of elimination, 13.5 +/- 4.3 versus 12.2 +/- 5.6 h). Our results indicate that although a modest increase was observed in the alprazolam Cmax, typical doses of valerian are unlikely to produce clinically significant effects on the disposition of medications dependent on the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 pathways of metabolism.",

After 24 h, rats were anaesthetized and measurements made of bile flow, liver function and in vivo sinusoidal area. Livers were then removed for histology. 3. Bile flow was unaffected by any treatment, except acute high-dose peppermint oil (830 microL/kg; 70% increase in flow). No change in liver enzyme activity was found, except for a 45% increase in alkaline phosphatase after chronic peppermint oil. No change in sinusoidal area in vivo or in histology was found following any treatment, although pretreatment with carbon tetrachloride reduced sinusoidal bed area and produced histological damage. Incubation of human hepatoma cells with 0.5 microL/mL (but not 0.05 microL/mL) peppermint oil or 20 mg/mL (but not 2 mg/mL) valerian resulted in increased cell death. 4. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated in vitro toxicity of high doses of valerian and peppermint oil in cultured human hepatoma cells and, at doses 2-3 orders of magnitude greater than those recommended for human use, an increase in rat bile flow after acute peppermint oil and an increase in alkaline phosphatase after chronic peppermint oil.",

No DNA damage was observed in ECV304 cells after culture for 48 h in the presence of 5,10, and 20 microg/mL of DEV. But a moderate degree of DNA damage was observed in the cells treated with 40 or 60 microg/mL of DEV. Quantitative analyses of DNA damage in the presence of antioxidants vitamin E (VE) and vitamin C (VC) were also carried out. The study revealed that both VE and VC exhibited a biphasic effect, reducing DEV-induced DNA damages at low concentrations but increasing them at high concentrations. We concluded that (1). the observed DNA damage in ECV304 cells induced by high concentrations of DEV was mainly through epigenetic mechanisms, i.e., reactive oxygen species mediated oxidative DNA damage (2). at the low doses, DEV did not appear to have any significant genotoxicity in ECV304 cells, and (3). VE and VC, at proper concentrations, can reduce or eliminate the adverse effects derived from high doses of DEV.

A total of 202 outpatients with a mean duration of insomnia of 3.5 months at baseline were included at 24 study centres (general practices) in Germany. - Sleep quality (SQ) after 6 weeks measured by the Sleep Questionnaire B (SF-B; CIPS 1996) showed that 600 mg/die valerian extract LI 156 was at least as efficacious as a treatment with 10 mg/die oxazepam. Both treatments markedly increased sleep quality compared with baseline (p <0.01). The other SF-B subscales, i.e. feeling of refreshment after sleep (GES), psychic stability in the evening (PSYA), psychic exhaustion in the evening (PSYE), psychosomatic symptoms in the sleep phase (PSS), dream recall (TRME), and duration of sleep confirmed similar effects of both treatments. Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI) and Global Assessment of Efficacy by investigator and patient, again, showed similar effects of both treatments. Adverse events occurred in 29 patients (28.4%) receiving valerian extract LI 156 and 36 patients (36.0%) under oxazepam, and were all rated mild to moderate. No serious adverse drug reactions were reported in either group. Most patients assessed their respective treatment as very good (82.8% in the valerian group, 73.4% in the oxazepam group).

In this pilot study, 24 patients suffering from stress-induced insomnia were treated for 6 weeks with kava (LI-150), 120 mg daily. This was followed by a 2-week 'wash-out' period off treatment, and then, five patients having dropped out, 19 received valerian (LI-156), 600 mg daily, for another 6 weeks. Then there was a further 2-week period off treatment, and a final 6 weeks of treatment of these 19 patients with the two compounds combined (kava + valerian). Stress was measured in three areas: social, personal and life events; insomnia in three areas also: time to fall asleep, hours slept and waking mood. Total stress severity was significantly relieved by both compounds individually (p < 0.01), with no significant differences between them; and there was also improvement with the combination, significant in the case of insomnia (p < 0.05). On direct questioning, 16 patients (67%) reported no side effects on kava, 10 (53%) on valerian and 10 (53%) on the combination. The 'commonest' effect was vivid dreams with kava + valerian (4 cases (21%)) and with valerian alone (3 cases (16%)), followed by gastric discomfort and dizziness with kava (3 cases each (3 %)). These results are considered to be extremely promising but further studies may be required to determine the relative roles of the two compounds for such indications.

      "abstract": "Serious sleep problems are common in children with an intellectual deficit (ID), and are often the source of much distress for both the child and caregivers. As yet, no satisfactory long-term treatment exists for intransigent sleep difficulties in children with an ID. Valerian, Valeriana spp., has been used for thousands of years to induce relaxation and sleep. Scientific investigation of valerian's sleep promoting ability in humans, whilst limited, has yielded promising findings. This initial study aimed to explore valerian's potential for assisting in the treatment of sleep problems in children with an ID. Five children with varying intellectual deficits and different primary sleep problems underwent eight continuous weeks of monitoring via sleep diaries, adhering to a double blind, placebo controlled and randomised design. Compared to baseline and placebo, valerian treatment led to significant reductions in sleep latencies and nocturnal time awake, lengthened total sleep time and improved sleep quality. The treatment was apparently most effective in children with deficits that involved hyperactivity. Although the findings are preliminary and in need of replication, there is evidence to suggest that valerian may be useful in the safe and effective long-term treatment of intransigent sleep difficulties in children with ID's, and therefore warrants further investigation.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The authors studied the sleep of patients with insomnia who complained of poor sleep despite chronic use of benzodiazepines (BZDs). The sample consisted of 19 patients (mean age 43.3+/-10.6 years) with primary insomnia (DSM-IV), who had taken BZDs nightly, for 7.1+/-5.4 years. The control group was composed of 18 healthy individuals (mean age 37+/-8 years). Sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) of the patients was analyzed with period amplitude analysis (PAA) and associated algorithms, during chronic BZD use (Night 1), and after 15 days of a valerian placebo trial (initiated after washout of BZD, Night 2). Sleep of control subjects was monitored in parallel. RESULTS: Valerian subjects reported significantly better subjective sleep quality than placebo ones, after BZD withdrawal, despite the presence of a few side effects. However, some of the differences found in sleep structure between Night 1 and Night 2 in both the valerian and placebo groups may be due to the sleep recovery process after BZD washout. Example of this are: the decrease in Sleep Stage 2 and in sigma count; the increase in slow-wave sleep (SWS), and delta count, which were found to be altered by BZD ingestion. There was a significant decrease in wake time after sleep onset (WASO) in valerian subjects when compared to placebo subjects; results were similar to normal controls. Nonetheless, valerian-treated patients also presented longer sleep latency and increased alpha count in SWS than control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in WASO associated with the mild anxiolytic effect of valerian appeared to be the major contributor to subjective sleep quality improvement found after 2-week of treatment in insomniacs who had withdrawn from BDZs. Despite subjective improvement, sleep data showed that valerian did not produce faster sleep onset; the increase in alpha count compared with normal controls may point to residual hyperarousabilty, which is known to play a role in insomnia. Nonetheless, we lack data on the extent to which a sedative drug can improve alpha sleep EEG. Thus, the authors suggest that valerian had a positive effect on withdrawal from BDZ use.",

However, during the last two decades a number of clinical trials have been conducted.Materials and methods: Systematic literature searches were performed to locate randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials measuring the effect of valerian monopreparations on sleep in human participants. Data were extracted in a standardized manner and methodological quality was assessed by the Jadad score.Results: Nine trials were located meeting the selection criteria. The findings of the studies were contradictory and there was great inconsistency between trials in terms of patients, experimental design and procedures and methodological quality.Conclusion: The evidence for valerian as a treatment for insomnia is inconclusive. There is a need for rigorous trials to determine its efficacy."

      "abstract": "A carefully designed study assessed the short-term (single dose) and long-term (14 days with multiple dosage) effects of a valerian extract on both objective and subjective sleep parameters. The investigation was performed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Sixteen patients (4 male, 12 female) with previously established psychophysiological insomnia (ICSD-code 1.A.1.), and with a median age of 49 (range: 22 to 55), were included in the study. The main inclusion criteria were reported primary insomnia according to ICSD criteria, which was confirmed by polysomnographic recording, and the absence of acute diseases. During the study, the patients underwent 8 polysomnographic recordings: i.e., 2 recordings (baseline and study night) at each time point at which the short and long-term effects of placebo and valerian were tested. The target variable of the study was sleep efficiency. Other parameters describing objective sleep structure were the usual features of sleep-stage analysis, based on the rules of Rechtschaffen and Kales (1968), and the arousal index (scored according to ASDA criteria, 1992) as a sleep microstructure parameter. Subjective parameters such as sleep quality, morning feeling, daytime performance, subjectively perceived duration of sleep latency, and sleep period time were assessed by means of questionnaires. After a single dose of valerian, no effects on sleep structure and subjective sleep assessment were observed. After multiple-dose treatment, sleep efficiency showed a significant increase for both the placebo and the valerian condition in comparison with baseline polysomnography. We confirmed significant differences between valerian and placebo for parameters describing slow-wave sleep. In comparison with the placebo, slow-wave sleep latency was reduced after administration of valerian (21.3 vs. 13.5 min respectively, p<0.05). The SWS percentage of time in bed (TIB) was increased after long-term valerian treatment, in comparison to baseline (9.8 vs. 8.1% respectively, p<0.05). At the same time point, a tendency for shorter subjective sleep latency, as well as a higher correlation coefficient between subjective and objective sleep latencies, were observed under valerian treatment. Other improvements in sleep structure - such as an increase in REM percentage and a decrease in NREM1 percentage - took place simultaneously under placebo and valerian treatment. A remarkable finding of the study was the extremely low number of adverse events during the valerian treatment periods (3 vs. 18 in the placebo period). In conclusion, treatment with a herbal extract of radix valerianae demonstrated positive effects on sleep structure and sleep perception of insomnia patients, and can therefore be recommended for the treatment of patients with mild psychophysiological insomnia.",

The effect was first examined the morning after a single evening dose of VRE (600 mg LI 156) vs. flunitrazepam (FNZ) (1 mg) and placebo (PL) (trial section A), and then after two weeks of evening administration of VRE (600 mg LI 156) vs. PL (trial section B). 99 volunteers were analysed in section A and 91 in section B. The primary criterion was the median of reaction time (MRT) measured with the Vienna Determination Test. Secondary criteria were cognitrones (alertness test), tracking test (two-handed co-ordination), sleep quality (VIS-A, Vis-M), further VDT parameters, and safety criteria. The single administration of LI 156 did not impair the reaction abilities, concentration and co-ordination. After 14 days of treatment, the equivalence of VRE and PL was proven by confirmative analysis concerning the improvement of MRT (p = 0.4481). Evaluation of the secondary criteria were consistent with the results of the primary criterion. It is concluded that neither single nor repeated evening administrations of 600 mg of VRE have a relevant negative impact on reaction time, alertness and concentration the morning after intake.",
