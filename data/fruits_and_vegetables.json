      "abstract": "The ferrous sulfate (FeSO4)-based mechanism causing ferroptosis-like death in Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated. FeSO4 triggered ferroptosis in P. aeruginosa planktonic cells, decreased the ratio of glutathione to oxidized glutathione, and resulted in the increase of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation, damaging the integrity of the cell membrane. In addition, FeSO4 prevented P. aeruginosa from forming biofilms on the surface of stainless steel, glass, and high-density polyethylene. Transcriptome analyses indicated that there were 412 up-regulated genes and 782 down-regulated genes following FeSO4 treatment. FeSO4 increased the cross-linking density of a carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) agar-based film, reducing its water solubility, swelling degree, water vapor permeability, and oxygen permeability. Finally, FeSO4@CMCS agar-based film showed potential antibacterial ability against the growth of P. aeruginosa in grapes, purple kale, and cherry tomatoes during storage."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Community-academic partnerships offer unique opportunities to leverage expertise and resources to modify structural factors that address community priorities. However, few in-depth examples of successful partnerships in rural communities to improve food security are available. This manuscript describes the process of building a partnership to reduce food insecurity in a rural Kentucky community. Methods: The research team worked with Cooperative Extension to form a community advisory board (CAB) representative of diverse sectors of the community who had interest in food security, agriculture, and/or nutrition. The CAB convened regularly, in-person or virtually, to review community assessment information and identify, select, and adapt relevant multi-level interventions. CAB members were invited to complete two surveys and participate in a listening session to provide feedback on working with academic partners. Results: Over the first two years of the project, 17 people served on the CAB. Early in the project, the CAB prioritized interventions for working families, relatives raising children, and lower income households. Some ideas were able to come to fruition (e.g., family cooking social classes, raised garden beds), while others were explored but were unable to gain momentum (e.g., mobile market) due to challenges with feasibility, organizational capacity, and/or interest. CAB members reported high engagement and strong communication between community and academic partners. Conclusions: Full exploration of potential solutions suggested by CABs may build trust between community and academic partners and could provide a strategic selection process for multi-level, evidence-based interventions deemed feasible for addressing complex issues such as food insecurity and nutritional health outcomes.",

      "abstract": "The green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from biological waste is an emerging technology that has excellent antibacterial properties. The present study has been designed to prepare silver nanoparticles by adopting green synthesis, which is based on the drying of fruits and vegetable peel to form silver nanoparticles. Two types of fruits (apples and tomatoes) and three types of vegetables (carrots, capsicum, and cucumber) were divided into three groups: one group was kept without any treatment, the second group was subjected to nanoparticles without silver nitrate, and the third group was subjected to silver nanoparticles. All the groups were stored for 15 days at room temperature and assessed for the physiochemical analysis of fruits and vegetables at 0 and 15th day and weight loss at 0, 5, 10, and 15th day of storage. Specifically, the titratable acidity of apples increased from 1.45 to 1.47 g/L, whereas nanoparticles and silver nanoparticles-treated apples ranged from 1.40 to 1.43 g/L. For tomatoes, the titratable acidity decreased from 0.54 to 0.44 g/L in controls, compared to 0.39-0.44 g/L in treated samples. Carrots in the control group decreased from 0.38 to 0.32 g/L, whereas treated samples maintained 0.29-0.34 g/L. Capsicum's acidity fell from 0.37 to 0.27 g/L in controls, compared to 0.28-0.32 g/L in treated capsicum. Cucumber's acidity decreased from 0.23 to 0.17 g/L in controls, whereas treated cucumbers showed 0.40-0.46 g/L. Overall, the nanoparticle treatments were effective in preserving the produce's titratable acidity, indicating enhanced freshness and extended shelf life. It was examined that treatments treated with nanoparticles and silver nanoparticles have a great impact on the shelf life of fruits and vegetables. There is a great possibility of using nanoparticles and silver nanoparticles in combination with peel extract of fruits and vegetables to improve the shelf life of vegetables and fruits."

      "abstract": "Fruits and vegetables (FVs) are consumed by humans for the distinctive flavors. Postharvest flavor declines limit its edible and commercial value. Light, as a novel non-thermal technology, is becoming a key strategy for enhancing FVs flavor. This review integrated the light treatment processes, summarized effects, mechanisms and factors of light emitting diodes (LEDs), ultraviolet (UV), pulsed light (PL) and γ-irradiation on FVs flavor. Based on photosensitization, photothermal and photochemical effects, four light treatments demonstrate positive impacts on flavor compounds. They enhance 9%-48% amino acid, 7%-41.5% organic acids and 4%-800% soluble sugar content. LEDs effectively boost the taste and aroma, becoming the most widely researched technology. UV and PL exhibit outstanding effects on aroma release, sweetness enhancement and astringency and bitterness mitigation, with UV also alleviating sourness degradation. γ-Radiation has been less explored, the promotion effect on the accumulation of flavor is observed. Factors such as light quality and dose are not overlooked. Based on the reduction of photothermal effects, future research should focus on elucidating the role of photoreceptors in the transcription regulation and the precise role of energy metabolism or other pathways in regulating flavor by responding to light signals."

      "abstract": "Significant losses of vegetables and fruits occur at multiple stages, including harvest, sorting, storage, and transportation, primarily due to mechanical damage, pathogen invasion, and the natural process of senescence. To mitigate postharvest decay and maintain superior quality of produce, conventional techniques such as low temperature storage and synthetic fungicide treatment are widely employed. Acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM), an effective plant resistance inducers, has demonstrated its efficacy in protecting against a diverse range of fungal and bacterial pathogens. The present review primarily concludes that exogenous application of ASM effectively maintains postharvest quality, delays senescence, and controls decay of postharvest fruits and vegetables through the following mechanisms: (1) modulation of signal transduction pathways including Ca2+ signal, H2O2, and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades; (2) regulation of reactive oxygen species metabolism; (3) accumulation of pathogenesis-related proteins; (4) activation of the phenylpropanoid pathway; (5) regulation of energy metabolism; and (6) mediation of fatty acid metabolism. Taken together, ASM is a potent activator that enhances resistance against a wide range of postharvest pathogens and effectively preserves the storage quality of horticultural products.",

Twenty-three participants were randomly assigned to complete an 8-week intervention condition (#800gChallenge®) or wait-list control condition. In weeks 1-4, intervention participants were asked to interact with an application reporting (a) whether they met their daily 800g F&V goal, (b) if their 800g of F&V was from a variety of sources, and (c) reading of daily educational material. Weeks 1-4 included weekly Zoom check-in meetings. Weeks 5-8 were autonomous, wherein participants reported in the application information regarding their 800g F&V goal. At baseline, 4-weeks, and 8-weeks, the participants were prompted to complete three Automated Self-Administered Dietary Assessment tool (ASA24) 24-hour diet recalls for generating Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores indicating diet quality. A two-way ANOVA was used to examine differences between the intervention and control groups in HEI total score, total vegetable, total fruit, and whole fruit component scores at baseline, 4-weeks, and 8-weeks. While no statistically significant differences in HEI scores were observed between groups, the intervention group showed promising improvements over the 8-week period. Notably, the intervention group increased their mean HEI total score, along with substantial gains in their total vegetable and total fruit consumption, indicating the intervention's potential for promoting healthier dietary patterns. These findings underscore the need for ongoing research to develop eHealth interventions of optimal duration and intensity that can drive meaningful improvements in the health of adults with poor diet quality."

      "abstract": "Fermented fruits and vegetables are rich in phenolic compounds, minerals, and vitamins, which have potential health benefits for the prevention of many diseases such as cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes. There is a growing demand for the development of nondairy probiotic products based on fruits and vegetables in view of changing lifestyles (e.g., vegetarianism, veganism, and allergy to dairy products) and the rise of nutritional diet therapy. In this review, the processes and health potential of fermented fruits and vegetables are described. The study focuses on the role of bacteria and fungi in fermented fruits and vegetables, outlines the process of transformation of bioactive components, and systematically summarizes the possible mechanisms of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and blood pressure-lowering effects. The health effects of fermented fruits and vegetables depend mainly on the microorganisms present in the fermentation process and the bioactive components they produce, such as phenols, vitamins, and organic acids. These active compounds exert many health effects such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, hypotensive, hypoglycemic, and other health benefits. Therefore, the development of fermented foods based on fruits and vegetables can be a promising way to adapt to the market demand and to reduce the wastage of agriculturally produced fruits and vegetables.",

Our aim was to understand the efficacy of such interventions in improving measures of cognitive performance or mental health and to identify successful intervention elements to inform future research. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, and CINAHL databases for articles published before August 2022 (PROSPERO registration no. CRD42022356571). A narrative synthesis was conducted according to the Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis guidelines. RESULTS: Of the 4686 articles identified, only 7 of the 17 full texts screened were included in the final review. No studies investigated the efficacy of interventions using \"whole\" fruits or vegetables. Six studies examined the effects of blueberries using drinks made from fresh (1 cup) or freeze-dried (30 g) blueberries and one study evaluated a mulberry powder-based drink. Sample sizes ranged from 14 to 54, and most studies were acute interventions with outcomes measured in a 2- to 3-h window (n = 6). Through a narrative synthesis of direction of responses, measures of executive function appeared sensitive to intervention effects in both acute and longer-term settings. Some concerns of risk of bias were evident, according to the RoB 2 tool, related to incomplete reporting of methodological aspects. CONCLUSIONS: The studies identified through this systematic review could not directly address the planned research question, resulting in poor certainty of evidence. Future research with whole fruit and vegetable interventions could better inform population health strategies for improved mental and cognitive health outcomes in children.",

However, human intervention trials, especially with whole F and V and in complex combinations, are lacking. The MiBlend Study explored the effects of various phytochemical-rich F and V combinations on chronic disease risk markers, phytochemical absorption, and gene expression in blood. This randomized cross-over study involved participants consuming two of seven different F and V blends for 2 weeks (450 g/day), following a 2-week low F and V intake period (50 g/day). Each blend represented major phytochemical classes (flavonoids, anthocyanins, carotenoids, and glucosinolates) or combinations thereof. Markers of chronic disease risk, including DNA damage, oxidative stress, and retinal microvasculature, were measured. Increasing F and V intake significantly improved plasma antioxidant capacity, DNA damage protection, and retinal arteriolar dilation. Flavonoid-rich, carotenoid-rich, and complex blends notably reduced DNA damage susceptibility. Anthocyanin-rich and carotenoid-rich interventions were most effective in boosting antioxidant capacity, while blends high in flavonoids, especially combined with anthocyanins, significantly improved retinal microvasculature. Gene expression analysis revealed changes in DNA repair, signal transduction, and transcription processes, indicating mechanisms for these health benefits. The study suggests specific F and V blends can provide targeted health improvements, emphasizing the importance of both overall F and V intake and the specific phytochemical composition for personalized preventive strategies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the significant role of fruit and vegetables (FAVs) in preventing a variety of chronic diseases and their potential to bolster immune responses and slow the progression of HIV infection to AIDS, there is a lack of studies on the dietary intake of FAVs among HIV-infected adults in Africa, including Ethiopia. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the magnitude of FAV intake and estimated consumption among HIV-infected adults receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in northcentral Ethiopia. METHODS: A multifacility cross-sectional study was conducted on the FAV intake among 865 HIV-infected adults receiving ART. A Poisson regression model with robust variance was used to identify factors associated with FAVs dietary intake. RESULTS: The study indicated that 655 (76.34%; 95% CI: 73.38, 79.07) HIV-infected adults reported consuming FAVs less than once per day, with 838 (97.67%, 95% CI: 96.41, 98.49) and 676 (78.79%, 95% CI: 75.92, 81.40) HIV-infected adults reporting consuming fruits and vegetables less than once per day, respectively. The median (IQR) total FAV intake was 271.3 (IQR: 92.5, 439.5) g/day, with the median (IQR) intake of fruits being 248.1 (IQR: 100.0, 400.0) g/day and vegetables being 273.78 (IQR: 82.44, 348.33) g/day, respectively. We found that being divorced (APR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.16, 2.12), employed as a daily laborer (APR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.36, 3.20), being employed (APR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.10, 2.84), merchants (APR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.03, 2.47), having children as caregivers (APR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.55), an advanced WHO clinical stage (APR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.32(1.03, 1.69), and receiving ART for more than 8 years (APR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.18, 2.67) were found to be independent predictors of FAV dietary intake among HIV-infected adults. From the findings, we understood that farmers were less likely to consume FAVs compared to employed individuals, daily laborers, and merchants. CONCLUSION: The finding indicated a very low level of FAV dietary intake among HIV-infected adults receiving ART, falling well-below the minimum recommendation for physically active adults. Despite living in areas with surplus production and producing these items, farmers are less likely to consume FAV. The study emphasizes the importance of focusing on the early stage of ART treatment for patients and family therapy, including counseling and guidance on consuming healthy diets such as FAVs, to enhance the role of children as caregivers for their families. Additionally, there is a need for comprehensive nutritional counseling to improve FAV consumption, with a particular emphasis on educating individuals about portion size estimation for the consumption of FAVs."

This review offers an extensive examination of the developmental significance, current cultivation techniques, and existing limitations of functional LK fruits and vegetables with the objective of providing guidance and inspiration for their exploitation. Additionally, this review investigates various factors influencing K content, including varieties, temperature, light, exogenous substances, harvest time, and harvest parts, with a focus on optimizing production methods to enhance potassium utilization efficiency (KUE) and decrease the K content in plants. Finally, the review outlines the shortcomings and prospects of research on LK fruits and vegetables, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary research (in agriculture technology, medicine, and business) for patients with CKD and the future development of this field."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sleep and diet are crucial determinants of overall health and wellbeing, with the potential to mutually influence each other. This study examined the association between sleep duration and fruits and vegetables (FV) consumption among Finnish adults. METHODS: The study analyzed data from the National FinHealth 2017 Study involving 5,043 adults aged 18 years and above. Participants reported their habitual sleep duration, and dietary consumption through a validated self-administered questionnaire. Confounders such as demographic, socio-economic factors, and chronotype were considered. A sensitivity analysis, which excluded energy under-reporters, was conducted to validate the findings. RESULTS: Mean dietary consumption was compared across three sleep duration categories (short, normal, long), revealing that short sleepers consumed 37 g/d fewer FV, and long sleepers consumed 73 g/d fewer FV than normal sleepers. Binary logistic regression analyses consistently demonstrated significant negative association between FV consumption and both short and long sleep duration across all models, even when adjusted for a range of covariates. Linear regression analyses revealed a positive but non-significant association between sleep duration and FV consumption that became significant when excluding energy under-reporters, particularly in model 1. DISCUSSION: This study suggests a consistent pattern where deviation from normal sleep duration was associated with decreased FV consumption, suggesting the need for considering sleep patterns in dietary intervention. The substantial role of accurate energy reporting in explaining these associations is highlighted. Further research, including longitudinal studies, is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying these associations."

      "abstract": "High voltage electrostatic field processing (HVEF) is a food preservation procedure frequently used to produce healthy minimally processed fruits and vegetables (F&V) as it reduces the growth of microorganisms and activates or inhibits various enzymes, thus retarding their natural ripening while preserving and even enhancing native nutritional quality and sensory characteristics. HVEF is one of the various nonthermal processing technology (NTPT) regarded as abiotic stress that can activate the antioxidant system of F&V and can also inhibith spoilage enzymes as, polyphenol oxidase (PPO), lipoxygenase (LOX), pectin methylesterase (PME), polygalacturonase (PG), cellulase (Cel), β-xylosidase, xyloglucan and endotransglycosylase/hydrolase, bringing positive effect on hardness, firmness, colour attributes, electric conductivity, antioxidant compounds, microstructure and decreasing electrolyte leakage (EL), malondialdehyde (MDA) contents and browning degree. This technique can also increase the contents of fructose, glucose, and sucrose and decrease the production of CO2 and H2O2. Additionally, it has been reported that HVEF could be used with other treatments, such as modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) and acidic electrolyzed water (AEW) treatment, to enhance its effects. Future works should deepen on elucidating the activation of the antioxidant systems by applying HVEF of critical enzymes related to the synthesis pathways of phenolic compounds (PC) and carotenoids (Car). Holistic approaches to the effects of HVEF on metabolism based on systems biology also need to be studied by considering the overall biochemical, physical, and process engineering related aspects of this technique.",

      "abstract": "Developing countries like Nigeria are increasingly employing pesticides to boost the productivity of their agriculture and food supply, despite the fact that doing so poses a health risk to the general populace. The purpose of this study was to assess pesticide residue levels in Lagos, Nigeria. A total of 18 samples from three neighbourhood markets were collected, and they were then examined for the presence of organochlorine (Endosulfan I, Pentachlorophenol, Heptachlor epoxide, and Endosulfan II) and organophosphate (Dichlorvos, Dimethoate, Phorate, and methyl parathion) residues. During the pre-treatment, the multi-residue Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS citrate) method with the addition of acetonitrile was used, and then samples were analysed using GC-MS. All of the samples contained dichlorvos, but the orange sample's concentration was below the limit of quantification, making quantification impossible. Dimethoate concentrations were below MRLs except waterleaf sample. With a concentration of 0.043 μg/mL, Waterleaf had the highest quantity of dimethoate in the sample. The findings of this study indicate that in order to safeguard the health of consumers, it is necessary to closely monitor organochlorine and organophosphate use nationwide, along with other related pesticides, and to test for pesticide residues in food products."

      "abstract": "Vacuum impregnation (VI) is a novel, non-thermal treatment that aims to modify the composition of food material by partially removing water and air and impregnating it with physiologically active compounds without affecting the structural integrity of food matrix. Application of VI accelerates the mass transfer processes, which leads to few changes in food composition and improves dehydration. Large volumes in intracellular spaces of fruit and vegetable tissues make it suitable to introduce different agents like nutrients, cryoprotectants, browning inhibitors, enzymes, and chemicals; enhancing texture profile and inhibiting tissue softening, or compounds lowering water activity and pH. water activity Thus, the VI may help to achieve new product quality associated with physicochemical features and sensory attributes. This review highlights the evolution and mechanism of VI technique, major factors affecting VI of fruits and vegetables and their responses to processing, and industrial relevance. Vacuum impregnation consists ability to revolutionize various aspects of food processing and preservation. VI serves as a versatile tool that enhances the quality, shelf life, and nutritional content of processed fruits and vegetables. It offers unique advantages of altering product composition by introducing desired compounds while preserving structural integrity. VI improves mass transfer processes, reduces water content, enhances the absorption of nutrients, antioxidants, and preservatives. This technology finds application in producing fortified foods, extending shelf life, and creating innovative products with improved sensory attributes. VI's ability to efficiently impregnate substances into porous materials, combined with its energy-saving potential and compatibility with other processing methods, makes it a valuable tool in the food industry. As consumers demand healthier and long-lasting products, VI emerges as a promising solution for meeting market demands."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Identifying effective, sustainable strategies to increase fruit and vegetable consumption is critical to addressing chronic disease risk. Models that provide incentives for produce purchases through reduced-cost or no-cost produce shares are promising. The purpose of our study was to examine the impact on fruit and vegetable intake of Good Food for All, a community-based program to distribute no-cost produce boxes to participants with low incomes. We also assessed program satisfaction and future interest in purchasing an affordable produce box. METHODS: The Good Food for All program was implemented in 22 US cities. Surveys were administered at baseline and postintervention. An online research panel was used as a comparison group and weighted to be demographically comparable to the intervention group. Descriptive statistics and adjusted difference-in-difference (ADID) models were used to examine differences in outcomes between groups. RESULTS: Respondents (intervention n = 632; comparison n = 1,153) were primarily White, non-Hispanic, and female. Intervention participants had a greater increase in total fruit consumption frequency (ADID: 0.43 times/d; 95% CI, 0.21-0.64; P < .001), total vegetable consumption frequency (ADID: 0.52 times/d; 95% CI, 0.12-0.91; P = .01), and total fruit and vegetable consumption frequency (ADID: 1.03 times/d; 95% CI, 0.49-1.56; P < .001) than comparison respondents. Most intervention participants reported boxes contained the right amount of food (71.9%) and high-quality produce (68.4%) and were willing to purchase a future produce box (85.0%). CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that a produce box distribution model increased fruit and vegetable consumption, had high satisfaction among participants, and generated interest in purchasing affordable produce boxes. Future studies should explore feasibility of offering low-cost produce boxes at grocery stores and determine appropriate pricing models to enhance access and sustainability.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Optical spectroscopy-measured skin carotenoid status (SCS) has been validated for estimating fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake; however, there is limited research addressing SCS kinetics in whole-diet interventions. The aim of this controlled feeding trial was to explore SCS's response to carotenoid intake changes via whole-diet intervention, evaluating its biomarker potential. METHODS: Eighty participants ages 20 to 49 y, without underlying diseases, were randomly allocated to the high-carotenoid group (HG; n = 40) or control group (CG; n = 40). The HG consumed a high-carotenoid diet (21 mg total carotenoids/2000 kcal), whereas the CG consumed a control diet (13.6 mg total carotenoids/2000 kcal) for 6 wk. Subsequently, skin and blood carotenoid concentrations were tracked without intervention for 4 wk. SCS was measured weekly via resonance Raman spectroscopy, and serum carotenoid concentrations were analyzed biweekly using high-performance liquid chromatography. Baseline carotenoid and F&V intakes were assessed via a 3-d diet record. The kinetics of SCS and serum carotenoid concentrations were analyzed using a weighted generalized estimating equation. Pearson's correlation analyses were used to examine baseline correlations between SCS and dietary carotenoid and F&V intakes, as well as serum carotenoid concentrations. RESULTS: During the intervention, the HG showed a faster and greater SCS increase than the CG (difference in slope per week = 8.87 AU, Pinteraction <0.001). Baseline SCS had positive correlations with total carotenoid intake (r = 0.45), total F&V intake (r = 0.49), and total serum carotenoid concentration (r = 0.79; P < 0.001 for all). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SCS is a valid biomarker for monitoring changes in carotenoid intake through whole diet, which supports using SCS for assessing carotenoid-rich F&V intake.",

      "abstract": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), defined as abnormal glucose tolerance that presents during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, is a growing issue in the United States and worldwide. If left untreated or poorly controlled, GDM can result in numerous consequences for both the mother and the fetus; thus, it is imperative that different avenues of management for GDM be explored. There is a paucity of studies that examine how lifestyle changes, including dietary and physical activity, affect management of GDM. We examined how counseling on lifestyle changes can affect cardiometabolic risks in women with GDM. We conducted a 12-week randomized controlled trial based on behavioral counseling in which women with GDM (N = 38) were randomized into either a nutrition education (control) (N = 18) group or nutrition intervention (N = 20) group. The nutrition education group were given dietary counseling regarding healthy dietary choices based on USDA guidelines, while the nutrition intervention group were instructed to consume a total of one cup of whole berries and one cup of leafy vegetables daily along with performing postprandial exercise (walking). Blood samples, anthropometric measures, and dietary and physical activity data, recorded in daily food and activity logs, were collected at baseline and at the end of the study and compared between the two groups. Dietary counseling on supplementation with whole berries and leafy vegetables resulted in increased fiber intake, increased antioxidant intake and total serum antioxidant capacity, improved random blood glucose, decreased serum IL-6, and improved HDL cholesterol versus the control group (all p < 0.05). These results highlight that whole berry and leafy vegetable supplementation-based dietary counseling can improve the metabolic pathways involved in gestational diabetes pathogenesis and prognosis. These functional foods must be recommended in the management of pregnancies affected by GDM.",

In a further 6-month extension study, we examined the effect of the 'free' use of this group of fruits and vegetables on blood phenylalanine control. For 6 months, the patients ate fruits and vegetables containing phenylalanine 76-100 mg/100 g without limit or measurement. Three-day diet diaries and the patients' weights were collected monthly. Blood phenylalanine spots were collected weekly aiming for blood phenylalanine levels <360 μmol/L. Retrospective blood phenylalanine was collected 6 months pre-trial. All 16 patients (69% females) from the intervention study took part in the extension study. Most of the patients (n = 14/16) had classical PKU with a median age of 10.5 years (range: 6-13). There was no statistically significant difference in the median blood phenylalanine pre-study (270, range: 50-760 μmol/L) compared to the 6-month extension study (250, range: 20-750 μmol/L) (p= 0.4867). The patients had a median of 21 and 22 bloodspots, pre- and post-trial, respectively. In the extension study, the patients had an actual mean intake of 11 g/day (4-37) natural protein and 65 g/day (60-80) protein equivalent from a protein substitute. The mean phenylalanine intake was 563 mg/day (200-1850) with only 19 mg/day (0-146) phenylalanine from fruits and vegetables containing phenylalanine 76-100 mg/100 g. The weight z-scores remained unchanged (1.52 vs. 1.60, p = 0.4715). There was no adverse impact on blood phenylalanine control when fruits and vegetables containing phenylalanine 76-100 mg/100 g were eaten without limit or measurement. However, the fruits and vegetable portion sizes eaten were small (60 g/week).

Individuals from the CG showed an increase in phosphorus consumption and, in the IG, a reduction in the consumption of total, saturated, and polyunsaturated fats as well as an increase in the consumption of monounsaturated fats was seen. In both groups, there was an increase in the prevalence of adequate nutrients. Participation in the nutritional intervention was associated with lower consumption of energy and protein in the diet.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inadequate intake of fruits and vegetables is prevalent in rural areas of India, where around 65% of the population reside. Financial incentives have been shown to increase the purchase of fruits and vegetables in urban supermarkets, but their feasibility and effectiveness with unorganised retailers in rural India is unclear. METHODS: A cluster-randomised controlled trial of a financial incentive scheme involving ∼20% cashback on purchase of fruits and vegetables from local retailers was conducted in six villages (3535 households). All households in three intervention villages were invited to participate in the scheme which ran for three months (February-April 2021), while no intervention was offered in control villages. Self-reported (pre-intervention and post-intervention) data on purchase of fruits and vegetables were collected from a random sub-sample of households in control and intervention villages. FINDINGS: A total of 1109 households (88% of those invited) provided data. After the intervention, the weekly quantity of self-reported fruits and vegetables purchased were (i) 18.6 kg (intervention) and 14.2 kg (control), baseline-adjusted mean difference 4 kg (95% CI: -6.4 to 14.4) from any retailer (primary outcome); and (ii) 13.1 kg (intervention) and 7.1 kg (control), baseline-adjusted mean difference 7.4 kg (95% CI: 3.8-10.9) from local retailers participating in the scheme (secondary outcome). There was no evidence of differential effects of the intervention by household food security or by socioeconomic position, and no unintended adverse consequences were noted. INTERPRETATION: Financial incentive schemes are feasible in unorganised food retail environments. Effectiveness in improving diet quality of the household likely hinges on the percentage of retailers willing to participate in such a scheme. FUNDING: This research has been funded by the Drivers of Food Choice (DFC) Competitive Grants Program, which is funded by the UK Government's Department for International Development and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and managed by the University of South Carolina, Arnold School of Public Health, USA; however, the views expressed do not necessarily reflect the UK Government's official policies."

Stalls from a fresh food market were randomized to intervention (n = 5 selling fruits, n = 5 selling vegetables) or control (n = 4 selling fruits, n = 4 selling vegetables) groups. The causes of surplus and waste were estimated by questionnaires. Surplus, avoidable waste, and unavoidable waste were measured using direct quantification before and after the intervention, and were expressed relative to the initial stock. Before the intervention, the surplus was (median [25th-75th percentile]) 46.2% [33.3-51.2] for fruits and 51.5% [41.3-55.0] for vegetables; avoidable waste was 0.1% [0.0-0.8] for fruits and 1.8% [0.7-5.3] for vegetables; and unavoidable waste was 0.0% [0.0-1.0] for fruits and 0.0% [0.0-1.3] for vegetables. Planning and storage represented the main causes explaining surplus and waste. After the intervention, the intervention group decreased the surplus of fruits compared to the control group (-17.8% [-29.0--11.0] vs. 5.8% [-0.6-7.8], respectively; p = 0.016), without other differences. In conclusion, tailored informational interventions based on the causes of surplus and waste may reduce the surplus of fruits in a fresh food market. Interventions might also include management strategies for the surplus to improve grocers' business operations."

The production and consumption of fruits and vegetables have a potential role in improving household food security and are considered one of the critical pathways for reducing food insecurity and malnutrition levels in the country. This paper set out to determine the effect of fruits and vegetables on the food security status of rural households in the Limpopo province. Data (secondary) for this study were collected from 2043 respondents who were selected through stratified random selection based on the population size of the district municipalities in Limpopo. This study used a quantitative research approach, and data were analyzed using a descriptive analysis, the household food insecurity access scale (HFIAS), and a Poisson regression model with an endogenous treatment model. The findings revealed that gender and involvement in agricultural production had a positive significant relationship with the consumption of fruits and vegetables, while disability grants had a negative impact. Age, household size, and receiving a disability grant had a positive significant impact on determining the household food insecurity status; however, gender had a negative significant relationship. This study concluded that the consumption of fruits and vegetables considerably influenced the food security status of the household.

METHOD: Sixteen focus group discussions (FGD) and eleven key Informant Interviews (KII) were conducted. Eight FGDs among adults and four among the youth and the elderly church members. Key informant interviews were held among church leaders and members of the church medical advisory. Study findings were categorized under thematic headings. Based on the data analysis, several key themes were identified: the knowledge of the concept of health and common health problems, opinions of physical activity, opinions of healthy eating and fruit and vegetable consumption, types and attitudes towards existing church-based health programs and the role of the church in health promotion and church-based health programs. Within each theme, several childthemes were noted such as the challenges with fruit and vegetable consumption, biblical support for physical activity and fruit & vegetable consumption, the role of the church leaders, program sustainability and barriers to participation. RESULTS: The participants perceived health not only as the absence of disease but as general well-being of the body and soul. Health was also related to the ability to perform religious activities. Common health problems included a mix of communicable and non-communicable diseases. They are aware that physical activity, fruits and vegetables are essential for healthy living. The youth saw it as a means of improving their physical appearance however the elderly expressed concerns about the possibility of associated trips and falls. Overall, they viewed fruits and vegetables as healthy foods while processed western foods were perceived as unhealthy. Fruits and vegetables were seen as beneficial primarily to aid food digestion, boost immunity, improve youthfulness, aid weight control and to prevent chronic disease. The study participants agreed that the church, as an institution, has a significant role to play in promoting the health of her members. Instituted health committees embedded within existing church structures often lead church-based health-promoting activities and are imperative for sustainability. Types of health programs included health talks, screening programs for common NCDs, sport competitions, distributions of FV during church ceremonies such as harvests, Lenten seasons, Love feasts and church bazaars. Health outreaches were seen as a means of evangelism, and it was unanimously agreed that the Bible supports PA and healthy eating. Generally, the respondents had positive attitudes towards church-based health programs and they advised that future programs include the use of technology and should be integrated into existing church activities to improve participation. The participants also noted that the opinion of the church leaders influences the behaviours of church members and their support is critical in the development and implementation of church-based health programs. CONCLUSION: Church members are aware that physical activity and the consumption of fruits and vegetables are important for healthy living and expressed support for church-based health programs. They believe that the Bible supports the promotion of PA and FV consumption as healthy behaviours. Program integration, the use of technology and support of church leaders and existing church medical advisory groups are imperative for developing and sustaining church-based health programs."

We have developed a novel lateral flow assay (LFA) using a sensitive monoclonal antibody (mAb) for monitoring IMP residues on fruits and vegetables. The 50% inhibition concentration result that was found when using the ELISA method was 0.247 ng mL-1, with the cut-off limits using the LFA method the result was 10 ng mL-1 (0.01 M PBS), and in the samples it was 20 ng mL-1 (with a recovery rate of 96-104.7% for Chinese cabbage, cowpea, apple, and pear samples, respectively). All of the results can be determined within seven minutes. The proposed LFA method is a valid, quick, and stable assay for the on-site detection of IMP in large numbers of samples."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between consumption of fruits and vegetables and pesticide residue intake from consumption of fruits and vegetables and risk of ultrasound- or hysterectomy-confirmed fibroids. Only a few studies have evaluated the association of fruit and vegetable intake with uterine fibroids, with inconsistent results. No studies have examined pesticide exposure through fruits and vegetables with fibroid risk. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): A total of 81,782 premenopausal participants from the Nurses' Health Study II cohort were followed from 1991 to 2009 for fruit and vegetable analysis, and 49,927 participants were followed from 1999 to 2009 for pesticide residue burden analysis. Their diet was assessed every 4 years with a food frequency questionnaire. Fruits and vegetables were classified into high- or low-pesticide residues using a validated method based on surveillance data from the US Department of Agriculture. INTERVENTION(S): Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Cases of ultrasound- or hysterectomy-confirmed fibroids were identified from self-reports to validated questionnaires. RESULT(S): From 1991 to 2009, 9,706 incident cases of ultrasound- or hysterectomy-confirmed fibroids were reported, and 4,195 incident cases were identified from 1999 to 2009. No association was observed between total fruit and vegetable consumption and uterine fibroid risk. Participants with the highest intake of total fruits (≥4/day) were 10% less likely to develop uterine fibroids compared with participants who consumed <1/day (95% CI = 0.80-1.01). No associations were observed with any other fruit or vegetable groups. An inverse association was observed between intake of high-pesticide-residue fruits and vegetables and fibroid risk (HR for 5th vs. 1st quintile = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.77-0.99), while no association with low-pesticide-residue fruits and vegetables was observed (HR for 5th vs. 1st quintile = 1.08; 95% CI = 0.95-1.23). CONCLUSION(S): Our findings suggest that pesticide residues on fruits and vegetables are not associated with a higher risk of uterine fibroids. Furthermore, our results suggest that intake of fruits may be associated with a lower risk of fibroids. Future research in this area should focus on dietary exposures across the life course as well as assessment of class-specific pesticides.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traditional thermal processing is a widely used method to ensure food safety. However, thermal processing leads to a significant decline in food quality, especially in the case of fruits and vegetables. To overcome this drawback, researchers are extensively exploring alternative non-thermal High-Pressure Processing (HPP) technology to ensure microbial safety and retaining the sensory and nutritional quality of food. However, HPP is unable to inactivate the spores of some pathogenic bacteria; thus, HPP in conjunction with moderate- and low-temperature is employed for inactivating the spores of harmful microorganisms. Scope and approach: In this paper, the inactivation effect of high-pressure and high-pressure thermal processing (HPTP) on harmful microorganisms in different food systems, along with the bactericidal kinetics model followed by HPP in certain food samples, have been reviewed. In addition, the effects of different factors such as microorganism species and growth stage, process parameters and pressurization mode, and food composition on microbial inactivation under the combined high-pressure and moderate/low-temperature treatment were discussed. KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: The establishment of a reliable bactericidal kinetic model and accurate prediction of microbial inactivation will be helpful for industrial design, development, and optimization of safe HPP and HPTP treatment conditions."

      "abstract": "Fruits and vegetables are an integral part of our diet attributed to their appealing taste, flavor, and health-promoting characteristics. However, due to their high-water activity, they are susceptible to microbial spoilage and diseases at any step in the food supply chain, from pre-harvest treatment to post-harvest storage and transportation. As a result, food researchers and engineers are developing innovative technologies that can be used to reduce the loss of fruits and vegetables on-farm and during postharvest processing. The purpose of this study was to gather and discuss the scientific data on the disease-suppressive activity of nanoparticles against plant pathogens. The progress and limitations of innovative approaches for improving nanoparticles' efficiency and dependability have been studied to develop effective substitutes for synthetic chemical fungicides and pesticides, in managing disease in fruits and vegetables. The findings of this study strongly suggests that nanotechnology has the required ability for disease suppression in fruits and vegetables. Applications of specific nanoparticles under specified conditions can enhance nutrition delivery to plants, provide better antibacterial and disease suppression activity. Nanoparticles can also lessen the quantity of agrichemicals/metals released into the environment as compared to standard formulations, which is one of the most impressive advances.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fruits and vegetables are healthy because they contain good nutrients and secondary metabolites that keep the body healthy and disease-free. Post-harvest losses of fresh fruits and vegetables limit access and availability as a result of foodborne infections and poor storage technologies. The selection of fruits and vegetables depend on the starting microbial load, the size of fruits and vegetables, and the type of infrastructure. SCOPE AND APPROACH: Despite the positive impacts of conventional thermal (roasting, boiling, blanching) and some non-thermal processing techniques such as High Pressure Processing (HPP), Pulse Electric Field (PEF), Cold Plasma Technology (CPT) on shelf-life extension, their use is commonly associated with a number of negative consequences on product quality such as cold plasma treatment increases the acidity and rate of lipid oxidation and further decrease the colour intensity and firmness of products. Similarly, in high pressure processing and pulse electric field there is no spore inactivation and they further limit their application to semi-moist and liquid foods. On that account, food irradiation, a non-thermal technique, is currently being used for post-harvest preservation, which could be very useful in retaining the keeping quality of various fresh and dehydrated products without negatively affecting their versatility and physico-chemical, nutritional and sensory properties. CONCLUSION: Existing studies have communicated the effective influence of irradiation technology on nutritional, sensory, and physico-chemical properties of multiple fruits and vegetables accompanying consequential deduction in microbial load throughout the storage period. Food irradiation can be recognized as a prevalent, safe and promising technology however, still is not fully exploited on a magnified scale. The consumer acceptance of processed products has always been a significant challenge for innovative food processing technologies such as food irradiation. Therefore, owing to current review, additional scientific evidences and efforts are still demanded for increasing its technological request."

Healthy eating habits, including intake of fruits and vegetables, can modify gut microbiota. This study aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of a formulated fruit and vegetable supplement (FVS) in modulating the antioxidant capacity and the gut microbiota composition. We enrolled 30 healthy volunteer subjects, matched for age, gender, BMI, and smoking habits, and randomized them into the FVS and the placebo (PLA) groups. Among the serum vitamins, the folic acid level was significantly higher (p = 0.001) in the FVS group than in the PLA group, whereas the vitamin B2 level was significantly higher in the PLA group than in the FVS group (p = 0.028). The antioxidant capacity, measured by using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method, was also slightly higher in the FVS group than in the PLA group but did not reach statistical significance. The dietary intake, assessed by 24-h recalls, did not show any significant changes after the supplementation in both the groups. The gut microbiome composition, measured by 16S rDNA sequencing, showed no difference in both alpha and beta diversities, whereas the LEfse analysis revealed a microbial shift after the treatment, with a decreased abundance of the genus Ruminococcus from the Lachnospiraceae family (p = 0.009), and the unclassified genus from the family Erysipelotrichaceae (UC36, p = 0.003) in the FVS group compared with the PLA group (confirmed by SIAMCAT analysis, AUC = 74.1%). With a minor effect, the genus Faecalibacterium and unclassified genus and family from the order Lactobacillales (UC31) were also increased in the FVS group compared with the PLA group (p = 0.0474, p = 0.0352, respectively). SCFA measurement by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed an increased level of 2-methylbutyrate in the FVS group compared with the PLA group (p = 0.0385). Finally, the Spearman correlation analysis showed that in the FVS group, the genus Faecalibacterium positively correlated with 2-methyl butyrate (p = 0.040). In the PLA group, none of the significant bacteria correlated with either SCFA or serum biomarkers. The network analysis confirmed the positive correlation between genus Faecalibacterium and 2-methyl butyrate. We can conclude that the FVS in healthy individuals modified the gut microbiota composition and metabolites, and it can potentially contribute to reduce the pro-inflammatory response along with the antioxidant capacity."

Native fruits and vegetables have been an integral part of the Indigenous Australian diet and Bush medicine for centuries. They have recently gained popularity owing to their rich dietary fiber, minerals, polyphenolic and antioxidant contents. This review presents a comprehensive summary and critical assessment of the studies performed in the last few decades to understand the phytochemical and nutritional profiles and therapeutic properties of Australian native fruits and vegetables. Furthermore, the potential of these fruits and vegetables as functional food ingredients and in the prevention and treatment of different diseases is discussed. Research on the nutritional and phytochemical profiles and therapeutic activity of Australian vegetables is limited with most studies focused on native fruits. These fruits have demonstrated promising antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities mostly in in vitro models. More research to a) identify novel bioactive compounds, b) define optimal post-harvest and extraction methods, and c) understand molecular mechanisms of pharmacological activity through preclinical and clinical studies is prudent for the prospective and wider use of Australian native fruits and vegetables by the food, pharmaceutical, and nutraceutical industries.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the implementation of a successful 2-for-1 price incentive for fruits and vegetables (F&V), including frozen and canned, that took place in partnership with a large chain grocery retailer in Maine. Intervention Approach. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) pilot study was conducted in 2015-2016, followed by a larger RCT in 2016-2017, to assess whether a supermarket double-dollar F&V incentive increased purchases of these items. EVALUATION METHODS: A convergent, parallel mixed-methods design was used to examine barriers and facilitators to implementing the interventions, using six implementation outcomes: acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, feasibility, implementation fidelity, and perceived cost. RESULTS: The intervention was deemed highly acceptable, appropriate, and feasible by shoppers, retailers, and researchers. The F&V discount had a high rate of initial adoption. There was a moderate degree of fidelity, which improved over time based on lessons learned from the pilot and applied to the subsequent RCT. Specific costs associated with implementation from the research perspective are reported. Implications for Practice, Policy, and Research. Partnerships between academic researchers and retailers can be an effective model for improving healthful purchases among shoppers. These findings are relevant for investigators, public health advocates, and retailers interested in implementing similar grocery retail-based interventions.",

      "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by variants in the gene that encodes phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), limiting the metabolism of phenylalanine (Phe). When PAH activity is absent or hindered, Phe is not converted to tyrosine, leading to an accumulation of Phe in the blood, which can cause serious neurological complications. Once PKU is diagnosed, treatment should be started immediately, and the basis for this is dietary restriction of foods with high levels of Phe, associated with the use of protein substitutes and intake of foods with low protein content. This restriction accompanies patients throughout their lives, making their diets unpalatable and monotonous, which represents a major challenge for health professionals and patients, considering that these factors favor food transgression. In this context, the objective of this work was to carry out an integrative review based on evidence regarding the intake of fruits and vegetables, by phenylketonurics, taking into account the greater or lesser tolerance to Phe. Since, some researchers have dedicated themselves to evaluating the biochemical effect of unrestricted consumption of fruits and vegetables at PKU, unifying the information in this regard. It was observed that the intake of vegetable protein by patients with PKU has shown to be promising since the studies indicate that the intake of these proteins does not present adverse effects to the metabolic control of the Phe.",

      "abstract": "Diets rich in fruits and vegetables are associated with better psychological wellbeing and cognitive functions, although it is unclear which molecules and mechanisms are involved. One potential explanation is the inhibition of monoamine oxidases (MAOs), which have been linked to several neurological disorders. The present study investigated the ability of kiwifruit to inhibit MAO-A and MAO-B, refining an in vitro assay to avoid confounding effects. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) were used to select individual kiwifruit metabolites for further analysis. Moreover, extracts of other common fruits and vegetables were screened to identify promising candidate inhibitors. Multiple extracts and compounds inhibited both enzymes, and the selective inhibition of MAO-B by the major kiwifruit specialized metabolite D-(-)-quinic acid was observed. These results suggest that fruits and vegetables contain metabolites that inhibit the activity of MAO-A and -B, offering a potential natural option for the treatment of neurological disorders, in which MAOs are involved."

DHCP attracts attention due to its cytotoxicity as well as potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. However, its effects and the difficulty of its identification in food are mediated in part by the formation of Michael adducts of DHCP with amino acids. The results revealed that DHCP reacted efficiently with cysteine and glutathione, and to a lesser extent with histidine. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the formation of adducts of DHCP with amino acids in a model system, being in a real food system difficult to investigate.

In SY2017-2018, the intervention group had a significant increase in imported FV when compared with the other three groups. No significant differences between groups were found on the other FV scales. Regarding gross motor skills, no significant differences between groups were found. In SY2018-2019, the intervention group had a significant increase in all FV scales except imported FV when compared with the enhanced intervention group. With gross motor skills, no significant differences were found between groups on its progress. These results warrant FFMM adaptations for the prevention of obesity among Guam preschoolers.",

Significantly, the kgd-M1@ACPs shows obvious fluorescent quench towards toxic pesticide DCN with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.09 μM and high recovery from 98.08 to 104.37%. Moreover, the kgd-M1@ACPs also presents an excellent DCN adsorption ability.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pesticide exposure is linked to a myriad of negative health effects; however, the mechanisms underlying these associations are less clear. We utilized metabolomics to describe the alterations in the serum metabolome associated with high and low pesticide residue intake from fruits and vegetables (FVs), the most common route of exposure in humans. METHODS: This analysis included 171 women undergoing in vitro fertilization who completed a validated food frequency questionnaire and provided a serum sample during controlled ovarian stimulation (2007-2015). FVs were categorized as high or low-to-moderate pesticide residue using a validated method based on pesticide surveillance data from the USDA. We conducted untargeted metabolic profiling using liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry and two chromatography columns. We used multivariable generalized linear models to identified metabolic features (p < 0.005) associated with high and low-to-moderate pesticide residue FV intake, followed by enriched pathway analysis. RESULTS: We identified 50 and 109 significant features associated with high pesticide residue FV intake in the C18 negative and HILIC positive columns, respectively. Additionally, we identified 90 and 62 significant features associated with low-to-moderate pesticide residue FV intake in the two columns, respectively. Four metabolomic pathways were associated with intake of high pesticide residue FVs including those involved in energy, vitamin, and enzyme metabolism. 12 pathways were associated with intake of low-to-moderate pesticide residue FVs including cellular receptor, energy, intercellular signaling, lipid, vitamin, and xenobiotic metabolism. One energy pathway was associated with both high and low-to-moderate pesticide residue FVs. CONCLUSIONS: We identified limited overlap in the pathways associated with intake of high and low-to-moderate pesticide residue FVs, which supports findings of disparate health effects associated with these two exposures. The identified pathways suggest there is a balance between the dietary antioxidant intake associated with FVs intake and heightened oxidative stress as a result of dietary pesticide exposure.",

Pulsed light (PL) is a non-thermal method for microbial inactivation (vegetative cells and spores) in fruits and vegetables. The PL treatment involves the application of intense and short-duration pulses of broad spectrum wavelengths ranging from UV to near-infrared (100-1100 nm). This review summarized application of PL technology to control microbial contamination and increasing shelf-life of some fruits and vegetables including apple, blueberries, grape, orange, strawberries, carrot, lettuce, spinach, and tomato. The microbial inactivation in very short treatment times, low energy used by this system, flexibility for solid or liquid samples, few residual compounds and no synthetic chemicals that cause environmental pollution or harm humans, is benefits of PL technique. The efficiency of PL disinfection is closely associated with the input voltage, fluence (energy dose), composition of the emitted light spectrum, number of lamps, the distance between samples and light source, and frequency and number of applied pulses. The PL treatments control pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms, so it facilitates the growth and development of the starter microorganisms affecting product quality.",

DESIGN: A randomised controlled community trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a 7-month nutritional intervention and to promote FV intake, separately and together. All participants attended physical exercise sessions. The intervention was based on the transtheoretical model and Paulo Freire's pedagogy. The interventions included group educational sessions, motivational cards and informational materials. The primary outcome was a change in FV intake (g/d), and secondary outcomes included stages of change, self-efficacy, decisional balance and knowledge on FV. All data were collected face-to-face; and FV intake was assessed using a validated brief questionnaire. SETTING: Health promotion services of Brazilian Primary Health Care. PARTICIPANTS: 3414 users of Brazilian Primary Health Care (1931 in the control group and 1483 in the intervention group (IG)). RESULTS: At baseline, the average daily FV intake was 370·4 g/d (95 % CI 364·2, 376·6). The increase in FV intake (23·4 g/d; 95 % CI 6·7, 40·0) and fruit intake (+17·3 g/d; 95 % CI 5·1, 29·4; P = 0·01) was greater in the IG among participants in the lowest baseline intake. Participants in the IG also showed progression in the stages of change (P < 0·001), increased self-efficacy (P < 0·001) and improved knowledge of FV crops (P < 0·001). CONCLUSIONS: The nutritional intervention was effective in increasing FV intake and fruits intake among individuals with a lower intake at baseline and in maintaining FV intake among those who reported consuming FV as recommended (400 g/d).",

The review discusses different types of homogenizers, their working mechanism, and application in F&V processing. Among mechanical homogenizers, knife mills are used for primary size reduction, ball mills for the micronization of dried F&V and rotor-stator homogenizers for emulsification. Use of the ultrasonic homogenizer is limited to extraction of bioactive compounds or as a pre-treatment for dehydration of F&V. High-pressure homogenizers are most widely used and reported due to the synergistic effect of homogenization and temperature increase, resulting in longer shelf-life and better physicochemical properties of the product. Additionally, the review also explains the effect of homogenization on the physicochemical, sensory and nutraceutical properties of the product.",

Plant-derived nanovesicles (PDNVs) have been recently receiving great attention regarding their natural ability to deliver several active biomolecules and antioxidants. To investigate the presence of active antioxidants in fruits, we preliminarily analyzed the differences between nanovesicles from either organic or conventional agriculture-derived fruits, at equal volumes, showing a higher yield of nanovesicles with a smaller size from organic agriculture-derived fruits as compared to conventional ones. PDNVs from organic agriculture also showed a higher antioxidant level compared to nanovesicles from conventional agriculture. Using the PDNVs from fruit mixes, we found comparable levels of Total Antioxidant Capacity, Ascorbic Acid, Catalase, Glutathione and Superoxide Dismutase 1. Finally, we exposed the nanovesicle mixes to either chemical or physical lytic treatments, with no evidence of effects on the number, size and antioxidant capacity of the treated nanovesicles, thus showing a marked resistance of PDNVs to external stimuli and a high capability to preserve their content. Our study provides for the first time a series of data supporting the use of plant-derived nanovesicles in human beings' daily supplementation, for both prevention and treatment of human diseases.",

In fruit samples, the lowest TVBC was enumerated at 3.18 ± 0.27 log CFU/g in Indian gooseberry and the highest at 6.47 ± 0.68 log CFU/g in guava. Staphylococci (2.04 ± 0.53-5.10 ± 0.02 log CFU/g), Pseudomonas (1.88 ± 0.03-5.38 ± 0.08 log CFU/g), and total fungi (2.60 ± 0.18-7.50 ± 0.15 log CFU/g) were found in all fruit samples; however, no Salmonella was detected in fruit samples. Similarly, the lowest TVBC recorded 5.67± 0.49 log CFU/g in cucumber and the highest 7.37 ± 0.06 log CFU/g in yard long bean.

      "abstract": "Habitual dietary intake is a major determinant of the species composition and functional output of the trillions of microorganisms residing in the human gut. Diet influences which microbes will colonise, flourish or disappear throughout life. An increase in polyphenols, oligosaccharides and fibre, which are all components found in a fruit and vegetable-rich diet, have long been associated with decreased risk of chronic diseases. Many of the benefits induced by this type of diet result from the interaction of these dietary components with the gut microbiome, where they selectively enrich specific microbial species and increase microbial diversity. Understanding the interaction of habitual dietary patterns on the gut microbiome will lead to rational dietary manipulation to improve human health through prevention and treatment of disease.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Fruits and vegetables (FV) distribution interventions have been implemented as a public health strategy to increase children's intake of FV at school settings. The purpose of this review was to examine whether snack-based FV distribution interventions can improve school-aged children's consumption of FV. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of articles published in English, in a peer-reviewed journals, were identified by searching six databases up to August 2020. Standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95 % CI were calculated using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was quantified using I2 statistics. SETTING: Population-based studies of interventions where the main focus was the effectiveness of distributed FV as snacks to schoolchildren in North America, Europe and Pacific were included. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies, reporting on fifteen different interventions, were identified; ten studies were included in the meta-analysis. All interventions were effective in increasing children's consumption of FV, with only one intervention demonstrating a null effect. Pooled results under all classifications showed effectiveness in improving children's consumption of FV, particularly for multi-component interventions at post-intervention (SMD 0·20, 95 % CI 0·13, 0·27) and free distribution interventions at follow-up (SMD 0·19, 95 % CI 0·12, 0·27). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that FV distribution interventions provide a promising avenue by which children's consumption can be improved. Nonetheless, our results are based on a limited number of studies, and further studies should be performed to confirm these results. More consistent measurement protocols in terms of rigorous study methodologies, intervention duration and follow-up evaluation are needed to improve comparability across studies.",

Simultaneous enantio-separation of multiple analytes was achieved with resolution ca. 1.67-2.14. Magnetically assisted QuECHERS was used to simplify and optimize sample pre-treatment. The new method was validated (accuracy, precision, matrix effect, etc.). Good linearity (0.5-20 μg/L, R2 > 0.99) and high recoveries (76.1-103.4%) based on intra- and inter-day relative standard deviation (RSDs) (2.6-11.9%), were obtained. Furthermore, a total of 90 samples were analyzed using this method and enantiomeric fractions (EF) for tebuconazole in strawberry and cucumber (0.63 and 0.43, respectively) were determined as well as 0.57 for flutriafol in tomato. This high-throughput detection method supported a convenient enantiomeric monitoring for chiral pesticides in fruits and vegetables.",

DESIGN AND METHODS: In this post hoc analysis of a clinical trial we randomized 108 macroalbuminuric, nondiabetic CKD stage 3 participants with metabolic acidosis to receive F + V (n = 36) calculated to reduce dietary acid by half, oral NaHCO3 (HCO3-, n = 36) 0.3 mEq/kg body weight/day, or Usual Care (UC, n = 36) assessed annually for 5 years. We calculated a mean overall health score for the groups as follows: 1 for improved, 0 for no change, and -1 for worsened at 5 years for plasma total CO2, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, change in medication dose (reduction = 1, increased = -1, no change = 0), and 1 for met goal and 0 for not meeting goal for estimated glomerular filtration rate (>30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and systolic blood pressure (<130 mm Hg). We also assessed the number of participants with cardiovascular disease events (myocardial infarctions + strokes) and group medication and hospitalization costs. RESULTS: Net plasma total CO2 increase at 5 years was no different between HCO3- and F + V. Average health scores at 5 years differed among groups (P < .01) with F + V (7.4 [mean] ± 1.6 [standard deviation]) being descriptively larger than HCO3- and UC (2.9 ± 1.6 and 1.2 ± 1.6, respectively). The number of participants suffering cardiovascular disease events differed among groups (P = .009) with none (0) in F + V, 6 in UC, and 2 in HCO3-. Total 5-year household cost per beneficial health outcome differed among groups (P = .005) with UC being highest and that for HCO3- and F + V being comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic acidosis improved comparably with F + V or standard oral NaHCO3, but F + V yielded ancillary beneficial health outcomes, fewer participants with adverse cardiovascular events, and per-household cost that was comparable to NaHCO3.",

This study's aim was to assess the impact of a healthy retail intervention on fruits and vegetables (FV) sales, as well as total sales, in tribally owned convenience stores where grocery stores are scarce. METHOD: We analyzed weekly sales data over the first 6 months of a healthy retail intervention. We assessed the proportion of sales from two FV baskets. The FV basket included all fresh, canned, and dried FV sold at stores; while the fruits, vegetables, and salads (FVS) basket included all FV items as well as all salads sold. We compared mean weekly sales rates in intervention and control stores over the 6-month period using generalized estimating equations models to account for repeated measures. RESULTS: Mean weekly FV basket sales rates were higher in intervention stores than control stores in both Nations. Mean weekly FVS baskets sales were significantly higher in intervention stores than control stores in one Nation and were higher, but not statistically significant, in intervention stores in the other Nation. Total sales remained steady throughout the intervention period. CONCLUSIONS: The THRIVE (Tribal Health and Resilience in Vulnerable Environments) intervention increased FV sales without negatively affecting total sales. Policy and Practice Implications. Healthy retail interventions in tribal convenience stores, where many Native Americans living in rural areas shop due to scarcity of grocery stores, could improve diet-related disparities without reducing total sales.",

African American women are a high-risk group. In this study, a fourth-generation multi-theory model (MTM) of health behavior change was used to design and evaluate a SistersAdding Fruits and Vegetables for Optimal Results (SAVOR) intervention for AA women. Methods: The study utilized a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with measurements taken at pretest, posttest (after the three-week intervention) and follow-up (at the end of eight weeks).SAVOR (n=26) was compared to an equivalent knowledge-based intervention (n=28). Process evaluation was done for program fidelity and satisfaction. A validated 38-item self-reported questionnaire was used to measure changes in MTM constructs and past 24-hour consumption of fruits and vegetables. Results: The SAVOR intervention resulted in improvement of mean consumption of fruits and vegetables in the experimental group from pre-test (2.78) to posttest (4.77) to recommended levels at follow-up (5.04) while in the comparison group they remained at around 3 (P<0.0001)Statistically significant changes (P<0.05) were noted for all MTM constructs except for participatory dialogue. Conclusion: The SAVOR intervention was found to be efficacious and established the robustness of MTM. SAVOR can be replicated for future effectiveness trials."

Food transformation that alters the appearance, texture, and temperature of foods is promising for solving this sensitivity problem. Objectives: This study evaluated the effect of physical transformation of fruits and vegetables (FV) to snacks to enhance ASD children's sensory approval for eating them. Design: This was a quasiexperimental design study. It lasted for 4 weeks with three episodes of FV exposure to the ASD children per week. The original condition was conducted in the first and fourth week, while intervention was performed in the second and third week. Settings: Food exposure took place in schools in a quiet room. Subjects: This study recruited 56 ASD children. Intervention: Food transformation constituted changing bananas into ice-cream, zucchinis and sweet potatoes into chips, apples and kiwis into popsicles, and carrots into juice. Outcome Measures: FV acceptance and habitual consumption were measured at baseline and postintervention. Results: ASD children increased their consumption of all FV, but only banana consumption was statistically significant from 55.3 to 78.0 g (p < 0.05). For habitual consumption, parents reported increases in all FV consumption for all three measured fruits and 2 of 3 measures of vegetables (pre vs. post mean for bananas: 2.4 vs. 2.9, apples 2.6 vs. 3.2, kiwis 2.4 vs. 2.9, zucchinis 1.9 vs. 2.5, and sweet potatoes 1.8 vs. 2.4; p < 0.05). Conclusion: Physical changes of foods may improve impaired sensory processing of ASD children to promote their FV acceptance. Project Code: RG 55/2019-2020R.",

Additionally, we also discussed limitations and negative effects of ultrasonic treatment on fruits and vegetables such as damages to tissues and cells. Furthermore, a proper application of ultrasonic technology has been proven to effectively extend the storage period of postharvest fruits and vegetables and maintain the quality. Moreover, the combination of ultrasound and other conventional preservation technologies can further improve the preservation in a coordinate manner and even have a broader application prospect.",

The significant differential toxicity of its four enantiomers and its important adverse effects on human health highlights the need for determination of PM enantiomers. The aim of this work was to develop the first enantioselective method for quantification of PM in fruits and vegetables. The method is based on the extraction of PM enantiomers in supramolecular solvents with restricted access properties (SUPRAS-RAM) and their separation/detection by chiral liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) which is first reported in this article. SUPRAS-RAM-based extraction is proposed as an innovative treatment approach that drastically reduces solvent consumption and avoids the need for sample cleanup. Extraction of PM enantiomers is quick (vortexing for 5 min) and efficient (recoveries 93-107%). The method is sensitive (quantification limits from 1.0 to 1.2 μg kg-1) and suitable for control of PM enantiomers in agri-food products.",

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated student outcomes from a new nutrition curriculum that includes messages from the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans with a teacher training component for high school Family and Consumer Sciences (FACS) teachers. METHODS: A cluster-randomized controlled study was conducted with 1104 students in FACS classes from 35 schools, taught by teachers trained in implementing a new curriculum (intervention) and teachers using their usual curricula (control). Students completed online surveys at the beginning and end of the semester, that is, pre- and postexposure to the nutrition curricula. Intention-to-treat analyses as hierarchical linear modeling were performed to determine if the intervention students had significant changes compared with the control students for knowledge of nutrition concepts, familiarity of, preferences for, affinity toward, number of times trying new, and daily times eating fruits and vegetables. Per-protocol analyses used the same hierarchical linear model but instead of control and intervention groups, students were split into 3 levels describing the amount of the new curriculum they received (0%, 1-50%, and 51-100%). RESULTS: Students exposed to 51-100% of the new curriculum tried more fruits and vegetables than both the control students and the students that received 1-50% of the curriculum (P = 0.009 for fruits and P = 0.002 for vegetables). Additionally, there were higher increases in the number of times intervention students tried a new fruit (P = 0.027) and vegetable (P = 0.022) compared with the control students, regardless of the amount of curriculum received. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that the curriculum, Forecasting Your Future: Nutrition Matters, has promise for increasing exposure to new fruits and vegetables for students. If teachers use most of the curriculum, students are likely to try more new fruit and vegetables, which could ultimately contribute to improved health."

Due to the special characteristics of these kinds of compounds, a previous step of alkaline hydrolysis was carried out for breaking conjugates that were potentially formed due to the interactions of the analytes with other components present in the matrix. Sample treatment was based on QuEChERS extraction and optimum detection conditions were individually optimized for each analyte. Cucumber (for high water content commodities) and orange (for high acid and high water content samples) were selected as representative matrices. Matrix-matched calibration was used, and all the validation criteria established in the SANTE guidelines were satisfied. Uncertainty estimation for each target compound was included in the validation process. The proposed method was applied to the analysis of more than 450 samples of cucumber, orange, tomato, watermelon, and zucchini during one year. Several compounds, such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 4-(3-indolyl)butyric acid (IBA), dichlorprop (2,4-DP), 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxy acetic acid (MCPA), and triclopyr were found, but always at concentrations lower than the maximum residue level (MRL) regulated by the EU."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a preschool-based nutrition education programme consisting of twelve 'hands on' nutrition education lessons delivered during the school year on young children's willingness to consume fruits and vegetables. DESIGN: Quasi-experimental, pre-post design including the collection of plate waste evaluation data at the start and end of the 2015-2016 school year within two groups: (1) randomly selected classrooms receiving the intervention and (2) within conveniently sampled preschool classrooms not receiving the intervention serving as a comparison group. SETTING: Centre-based preschool programmes serving low-income families in the Denver metro area. PARTICIPANTS: Three- to five-year-old children in preschool classrooms participating in the intervention during the 2015-2016 school year (n 308) and children enrolled in comparison classrooms (n 215). RESULTS: Repeated-measures logit models assessed whether increases in the odds of consuming small samples of fruits and vegetables between Time 1 (pre-intervention) and Time 2 (post-intervention) were different for children within the intervention group compared with the comparison group. Analyses showed that the change over time in consumption of the three vegetable samples varied by intervention status with greater change occurring among children within the intervention group (edamame: P = 0·001; cauliflower: P ≤ 0·0001 and red pepper: P ≤ 0·0001). Unlike vegetables, the change over time in consumption of the two fruit samples was not different between children within the intervention and comparison groups. CONCLUSIONS: An experiential-learning nutrition education programme can positively influence eating behaviours of low-income preschoolers in a centre-based setting by increasing willingness to consume vegetables.",

      "abstract": "Background: Media use is a known contributor to childhood obesity, but encouraging reductions in screen use only partially eliminates media influence. We tested a family-centered, media literacy-oriented intervention to empower parents and children 9-14 years to skillfully use media to reduce marketing influences, enhance nutrition knowledge, improve the selection of foods in the home environment, and improve fruit and vegetable consumption. Methods: A community-based, 6-U program included separate parent and youth (ages 9-14 years) sessions, each of which was followed by a session together in which skills from the individual sessions were reinforced. A pretest to posttest field test with control groups (N = 189, parent-child dyads) tested the intervention's efficacy. Results: Standardized mean differences from the multiple analysis of covariance tests showed that the intervention group demonstrated improvements on parents' use of nutrition labels (0.29), the ratio of healthy to unhealthy food in the home environment (0.25), youth's fruit (0.30) and vegetable (0.25) consumption, parent and youth media literacy skills, and family communication dynamics about food. The largest effects found were for negative parental mediation (0.48) and parents' report of child-initiated discussion (0.47). Consistent but weaker results were revealed for Latinx families. Conclusions: This family-centered approach helped family members practice using media together to make better nutrition decisions without depending on the ability of parents to limit media use. It successfully addressed the often-negative impact of the media on behaviors that increase obesity risk while also cultivating the potential for media to provide useful information that can lead to behaviors that decrease obesity risk.",

      "abstract": "Intake of conventionally-grown fruits and vegetables with higher levels of pesticide residue contamination has been associated with poorer semen quality and lower probability of live birth among couples undergoing fertility treatment. We examined the association between dietary intake of pesticide residues and fecundability, the per cycle probability of conception, in a preconception cohort of pregnancy planners. We enrolled women aged 21-45 years who were attempting to conceive without use of fertility treatment into Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO) from June 2013 through September 2019. Participants completed a baseline questionnaire on demographics, lifestyle factors, and medical and reproductive histories, and bimonthly follow-up questionnaires for up to 12 months or until reported conception. Ten days after baseline, participants completed the National Cancer Institute's Diet History Questionnaire II, a validated food frequency questionnaire. Using data from the USDA Pesticide Data Program, we classified fruits and vegetables as having high or low pesticide residues using a validated method. We examined the relation between greater intake of high- and low-pesticide residue fruits and vegetables with fecundability using proportional probabilities regression models, adjusted for potential confounders and accounting for consumption of organic produce. We restricted our analysis to 5234 women who had been attempting conception for ≤6 cycles at study entry, and further stratified by pregnancy attempt time at study entry (<3 vs. 3-6 cycles) to evaluate potential for reverse causation. Intakes of high- and low-pesticide residue fruits and vegetables were not appreciably related to fecundability in the full sample, or among women trying to conceive for <3 cycles at study entry. However, among women trying to conceive for 3-6 cycles at study entry, both high- and low-pesticide residue fruit and vegetable intakes were strongly inversely related to fecundability, indicating potential reverse causation bias. These results do not support the hypothesis that intake of pesticide residues from conventionally-grown fruits and vegetables is harmful to fertility, although non-differential exposure misclassification may have attenuated our findings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Social inequalities in nutrition lead a high number of families to struggle with food insecurity, even in developed countries. We aimed to assess the impact of fruits and vegetables vouchers on food security among disadvantaged households from a Paris suburb. METHODS: We used a pre-post assessment design. Families answered face-to-face questionnaires on food consumption and food security status before and after a randomly assigned intervention. Households in the intervention group received vouchers to buy exclusively fruits and vegetables over one year. Both intervention and control groups benefitted from nutritional education through workshops performed by dieticians during the study period. The Household Food Security Module (HFSM) was used to assess food security status of households at inclusion. Food Insufficiency Indicator (FSI) was used to assess food security at inclusion and follow-up. Evolution of FSI on both groups was evaluated using McNemar test. RESULTS: Among the 91 families included between May 2015 and May 2016, 64 completed the post assessment questionnaire. At inclusion, 68.3% of families were experiencing food insecurity and 78.1% were experiencing food insufficiency. No association was found between food consumptions and food security status. After one-year follow-up, the prevalence of food insufficiency was significantly decreased in the intervention group (61.8%, with p value = 0.03), and unchanged in the control group. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, food insufficiency was significantly decreased in families receiving vouchers for fruits and vegetables over a one-year period.

      "abstract": "Implementing interventions that manipulate food store environments are one potential strategy for improving dietary behaviors. The present study evaluated intervention effects, from the El Valor de Nuestra Salud (The Value of Our Health) study, on in-store environmental changes within Latino/Hispanic-focused food stores (tiendas). Sixteen tiendas were randomly assigned to either: a six-month structural and social food store intervention or a wait-list control condition. Store-level environmental measures of product availability, placement, and promotion were assessed monthly from baseline through six-months post-baseline using store audits. Linear mixed effects models tested for condition-by-time interactions in store-level environmental measures. Results demonstrated that the intervention was successful at increasing the total number of fruit and vegetable (FV) promotions (p < 0.001) and the number of FV promotions outside the produce department (p < 0.001) among tiendas in the intervention versus control condition. No changes in product availability or placement were observed. Results suggests changing the marketing mix element of promotions within small stores is measurable and feasible in an in-store intervention. Difficulties in capturing changes in product availability and placement may be due to intervention implementation methods chosen by tiendas. It is important to build upon the lessons learned from these types of interventions to disseminate evidence-based in-store interventions.",

Children, ages 3-12 years old for CIC and UDC and 5-12 years old for RSC, participated: CIC (n = 47), UDC (n = 23), and RSC (n = 33). Children's willingness to try FV was assessed with the Adapted WillTry tool before and after each program. Whole FV intakes were assessed concurrently using the mobile food record in CIC and UDC. Using multivariate regression, WillTry post-assessment outcomes were modeled adjusting for pre-assessment, child characteristics, exposure, and parent cultural affiliation. Unique to the Adapted WillTry tool are three FV scales, local novel, local common, and imported, which are classified by source (local or imported) and/or familiarity (novel or common). WillTry adjusted mean FV post-scores by highest exposure camp to lowest were 2.2, 2.3, and 2.2 for local novel and 2.6, 2.6, and 2.6 for local common. No differences among camps were significant; however, there was an increase in the willingness to try scores for all FV score types and camps. The Traditions pilot study demonstrated: (1) feasibility of a multi-arm parallel design using existing community programs in limited-resource environments and (2) further examination of nutrition education components and contexts are needed to understand diet behaviors of indigenous populations.",

      "abstract": "Inadequate fruits and vegetables consumption in adolescence increases adolescents' current and future chronic disease risk and is predictive of inadequate consumption in adulthood. Given that adolescents' engagement in dietary behaviors is complicated by intrapersonal, interpersonal, and environmental factors, a health behavior model of change incorporating all of these factors is most appropriate to inform research and intervention efforts. Yet, common preventive health behavior models used to explain adolescents' dietary behaviors do not adequately account for these factors. The current study explored the utility of a comprehensive, predictive model, that is the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model, for explaining adolescents' fruits and vegetables consumption in a cross-sectional national sample. Study hypotheses included (1) health information and motivation for fruits and vegetables would directly be related to fruits and vegetables consumption; and (2) the relationship between fruits and vegetables consumption and health information and motivation would be mediated by behavioral skills for consumption. Data from the adolescent diet-related surveys of the Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating (FLASHE) study (N = 1646) were used. Structural equation modeling was used to test study hypotheses. Fruits and vegetables-related information and motivation were positively related to adolescents' fruits and vegetables consumption. For information and personal motivation (specifically fruits and vegetables preferences), the relationship with fruits and vegetables consumption was partially mediated through behavioral skills. These preliminary findings support the utility of the IMB model to explain adolescents' fruits and vegetables consumption.",

From a social ecological perspective, increasing access to affordable fresh fruits and vegetables in communities should encourage consumption and health improvements. Change the Future West Virginia, a statewide intervention, was undertaken to make policy, system, and environment (PSE) changes to enhance access to fresh fruits and vegetables in schools, farmers markets, and retail food outlets. Previous local scale PSE change interventions have shown feasibility and population reach, but broader dissemination has not been evaluated. Thus, the purpose was to evaluate the Adoption and Reach of Change the Future West Virginia statewide nutrition-based PSE strategies, especially in food deserts. Evaluation data were collected monthly using an online performance monitoring tool, including open-ended items to assess barriers and facilitators of PSE changes. Schools from 48 of 55 counties with 261,829 enrollment (54% low-income) implemented 231 PSE activities, resulting in 35 counties serving locally produced foods. Adoption included two thirds (n = 82) of all farmers markets in the state-signed collaboration agreements, adding electronic benefit transfer machines at 29. Retail food Adoption included signed agreements with 22.1% (n = 101) of all grocery stores and 14.1% (n = 162) of all convenience stores in the state reaching 110,258 people (21.5%) in 27 food desert census tracts. Personnel consistency, local connections, and in-person meetings were important for PSE changes, highlighting the importance of human resources in the rural public health system and the potential of these intervention activities in rural, low-income states.",

METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was carried out with participants from the Health Academy Program in Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil. The intervention (7 mo) was based on the Transtheoretical Model and on Paulo Freire's pedagogy and offered 12 education activities with the purpose of promoting the consumption of fruits and vegetables. Adherene was determined by calculating the participation percentage (attendance at activities/number of activities). RESULTS: In all, 1483 individuals participated and the average adherence was 58.3%. Low adherence was demonstrated by 24.3%, medium adherence by 26.5%, and high adherence by 49.2% of the participants. Adherence was associated with aging (odds ratio [OR], 1.97; 95% CI, 1.33-2.94), being unemployed (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58-0.95), not being under psychiatric treatment (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63-0.95), participant body satisfaction (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.02-1.58) and participant attendance at the Health Academy Program for >1 y (OR, 2.78; 95% CI, 2.17-3.56). The qualitative analysis revealed the following facilitators for adherence: service structure, intervention methodology, bond-building among users and professionals, family support, and patient-associated aspects. The barriers to adherence included work, self-care, and care for another. CONCLUSION: Adherence to the intervention was high, and the patient-associated aspects, the logistics of the Health Academy Program, and the methodology appeared to contribute to adherence. However, the timetable was a barrier for those who were working and for those who support their families.",

      "abstract": "Fresh fruits and vegetables are a rich source of micronutrients. However, many foodborne illnesses have been linked to the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables as they are reported to harbor contaminants such as microorganisms and pesticides. Recently reported foodborne outbreaks have been linked to a diverse group of fruits and vegetables due to the presence of various pathogens including Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. Also, the increased use of pesticides has resulted in the deposition of chemical residues on the surface of fruits and vegetables, which has led to the adverse health conditions such as cancer, birth defects, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Fresh commodities are subjected to various treatments to prevent or minimize these outbreaks, and the main targets of such treatments have been the elimination of pathogens and degradation of toxic chemical residues. Here, we have discussed various decontamination methods including simple household washing, chemical treatments, and modern technologies with their mode of action for microbial and pesticide removal. The simple household processes are not very effective in the removal of pathogenic organisms and pesticides. The use of modern techniques like cold plasma, ozone, high hydrostatic pressure, and so on, showed better efficacy in the removal of microorganisms and pesticides. However, their industrial use is limited considering high installation and maintenance cost. In this review, we suggest combined methods based on their mode of decontamination and suitability for a selected fruit or vegetable for effective decontamination of microbes and pesticide together to reduce the treatment cost and enhance food safety."

      "abstract": "Abstract: Fruits and vegetables are healthy foods but under-consumed among infants and children. Approaches to increase their intake are urgently needed. This study investigated the effects of a systematic introduction of taste portions and a novel protein-reduced complementary diet based on Nordic foods on fruit and vegetable intake, growth and iron status to 9 months of age. Healthy, term infants (n = 250) were recruited and randomly allocated to either a Nordic diet group (NG) or a conventional diet group (CG). Infants were solely breast- or formula-fed at study start. From 4 to 6 months of age, the NG followed a systematic taste portions schedule consisting of home-made purées of Nordic produce for 24 days. Subsequently, the NG was supplied with baby food products and recipes of homemade baby foods based on Nordic ingredients but with reduced protein content compared to the CG. The CG was advised to follow current Swedish recommendations on complementary foods. A total of 232 participants (93%) completed the study. The NG had significantly higher intake of fruits and vegetables than the CG at 9 months of age; 225 ± 109 g/day vs. 156 ± 77 g/day (p < 0.001), respectively. Energy intake was similar, but protein intake was significantly lower in the NG (-26%, p < 0.001) compared to the CG. This lower protein intake was compensated for by higher intake of carbohydrate from fruits and vegetables. No significant group differences in growth or iron status were observed. The intervention resulted in significantly higher consumption of fruits and vegetables in infants introduced to complementary foods based on Nordic ingredients.",

DESIGN: Nonexperimental pretest-posttest design SETTING: Art on a Plate workshops with children from 14 countries in Asia, America, and Europe. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 433 workshop participants aged 4-14 years (mean age, 8.6 years). INTERVENTION: Instructed by a chef, children in the workshops created a self-chosen design on their plate with a spinach-fruit salad. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Before and after the workshop, a questionnaire assessing liking and willingness to eat or taste; hunger was assessed using the Teddy the Bear method and emotions were assessed using the Self-assessment Manikin. The event coordinator evaluated salad intake. ANALYSIS: Linear and generalized linear (logit) mixed models were used to test statistical differences before and after the workshop. RESULTS: The workshop resulted in a small increase in liking (n = 409; P = .02) and person control (n = 375; P < .001) and a decrease in hunger (n = 379; P < .001). A total of 30% of children increased their liking scores, 18% decreased them, and 52% did not change them. Significant associations of liking and change in liking with salad intake were in the expected direction. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This study showed the positive effect of a cooking workshop on children's salad liking across a selection of countries worldwide. Further research and novel methods are needed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of cooking activities in real-life settings across countries.",

      "abstract": "Introduction-Text-messaging interventions hold promise for successful weight loss interventions. However, there is limited research on text-messaging interventions to improve dietary intake among rural adolescents, who are at greater risk for obesity and related risk factors. The goal of this study was to test an eight-week, mentor-led text-messaging intervention among 14⁻16-year-old rural adolescents: the \"Go Big and Bring It Home\" Project to improve fruit and vegetable and healthy beverage intake. Methods and Materials-Eight rural high schools in eastern Kentucky and eastern North Carolina participated (n = 4 were randomized as intervention schools and n = 4 were randomized as control schools). Adolescents were recruited to participate in the eight-week text-messaging intervention. The text messages were primarily affective messages, and included a weekly challenge related to consuming fruits, vegetables, or healthy/low-calorie beverages. Undergraduate nutrition students sent text messages on Tuesday and Saturday every week over the eight-week period via the \"Group Me\" mobile application. Delayed controls received no information or text messages during the eight-week intervention. Fruit and vegetable intake was measured with the National Cancer Institute Fruit and Vegetable screener and beverage intake was assessed using the Beverage Questionnaire-10 (BEVQ-10). Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted among all those that completed the baseline and post-intervention survey (n = 277 intervention students and n = 134 delayed control students). All linear regression models were adjusted for race and were clustered on school to control for intraclass correlation. Results-In adjusted analyses, there was a statistically significant positive intervention effect on the primary outcome of fruit and vegetable servings/day with a mean difference between intervention and control participants of 1.28 servings/day (95% Confidence Interval 1.11, 1.48). There was no intervention effect on beverage intake. There was a statistically significant increase in the odds of goal setting for healthier dietary behaviors among intervention participants relative to controls. Conclusion-An eight-week text-messaging intervention led to increases in self-reported fruit and vegetable intake and improvements in goal setting for healthier dietary behaviors. Due to the use of undergraduate students to deliver the messages, and use of an existing web application, this text-messaging intervention can be sustained in underserved, rural environments. Thus there is potential for significant reach and public health impact to improve dietary patterns.",

Under the optimal conditions, all three chiral pesticides showed decent enantiomeric separation (Rs > 1.48). The linearity of each target was good with the correlation coefficient (r2 ) being greater than 0.9923. The average recoveries of the three spiked levels were 73.4% to 110.9% with repeatability (RSDr ) less than 7.6%, and the limit of quantification of the method was 0.10 to 0.25 mg·kg-1 .

The main objective of this trial was to evaluate the impact of vouchers for FV purchase on the consumption of FV among children living in disadvantaged families in a French urban district. METHODS: The FLAM study was a controlled randomized intervention trial, performed in Saint-Denis (North suburbs of Paris). The study group (intervention or control) was randomly attributed to parent-child pairs at inclusion. The intervention group received vouchers exchangeable for FV over a 1 year period. Nutritional education through workshops was available for both groups. FV consumption was assessed through face-to-face food frequency questionnaires. Participants who reported eating less than 3.5 FV per day were considered low FV consumers. RESULTS: A total of 92 parent-child pairs were included, in which 45 were allocated to the intervention group and 47 to the control group. Amongst them, 64 completed the final follow-up questionnaire (30% lost to follow-up). After one year, the proportion of low FV consumers in children was significantly lower in the intervention group (29.4%) compared to the control group (66.7%, p = 0.005). Overall, 82% of the vouchers were used by the families. CONCLUSIONS: This study found a decreased proportion of small consumers in children after 1 year of distribution of FV vouchers compared to the control group. FV vouchers could be an effective lever to increase FV consumption among children from disadvantaged households. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier no. NCT02461238 .",

The present study assessed how sociodemographic characteristics, physical access and fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption are associated with market use in a newly opened F&V market next to a subway station in a disadvantaged neighbourhood. DESIGN: Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted among adults: (i) on-site, among shoppers who had just bought F&V and (ii) a telephone-based population survey among residents living within 1 km distance from the market. SETTING: One neighbourhood in Montreal (Canada) with previously limited F&V offerings. SUBJECTS: Respectively, 218 shoppers and 335 residents completed the on-site and telephone-based population surveys. RESULTS: Among shoppers, 23 % were low-income, 56 % did not consume enough F&V and 54 % did not have access to a car. Among all participants living 1 km from the market (n 472), market usage was associated (OR; 95 % CI) with adequate F&V consumption (1·86; 1·10, 3·16), living closer to the market (for distance: 0·86; 0·76, 0·97), having the market on the commute route (2·77; 1·61, 4·75) and not having access to a car (2·96; 1·67, 5·26). CONCLUSIONS: When implemented in strategic locations such as transport hubs, AFS like F&V markets offer a promising strategy to improve F&V access among populations that may be constrained in their food acquisition practices, including low-income populations and those relying on public transportation.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of increasing intake of either WG or FV on inflammatory markers and gut microbiota composition. METHODS: A randomized parallel arm feeding trial was completed on forty-nine subjects with overweight or obesity and low intakes of FV and WG. Individuals were randomized into three groups (3 servings/d provided): WG, FV, and a control (refined grains). Stool and blood samples were collected at the beginning of the study and after 6 weeks. Inflammatory markers [tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)] were measured. Stool sample analysis included short/branched chain fatty acids (S/BCFA) and microbiota composition. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in LBP for participants on the WG (- 0.2 μg/mL, p = 0.02) and FV (- 0.2 μg/mL, p = 0.005) diets, with no change in those on the control diet (0.1 μg/mL, p = 0.08). The FV diet induced a significant change in IL-6 (- 1.5 pg/mL, p = 0.006), but no significant change was observed for the other treatments (control, - 0.009 pg/mL, p = 0.99; WG, - 0.29, p = 0.68). The WG diet resulted in a significant decrease in TNF-α (- 3.7 pg/mL; p < 0.001), whereas no significant effects were found for those on the other diets (control, - 0.6 pg/mL, p = 0.6; FV, - 1.4 pg/mL, p = 0.2). The treatments induced individualized changes in microbiota composition such that treatment group differences were not identified, except for a significant increase in α-diversity in the FV group. The proportions of Clostridiales (Firmicutes phylum) at baseline were correlated with the magnitude of change in LBP during the study. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that WG and FV intake can have positive effects on metabolic health; however, different markers of inflammation were reduced on each diet suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effects were facilitated via different mechanisms. The anti-inflammatory effects were not related to changes in gut microbiota composition during the intervention, but were correlated with microbiota composition at baseline.

Locally-grown and imported fruit and vegetable samples, collected in 2016 were inspected for 10 perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) using QuEChERS as sample pre-treatment procedure followed by micro-HPLC-MS/MS. Three of 10 target analytes, perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were quantitatively determined. The detection frequency for PFASs across the 55 samples analysed was less than 10%. The major contributor of the total PFASs concentration in the investigated group was PFBA for which the concentration, reported only for banana, apple and orange samples, was 50.740 ng g-1 ww. The most often detected compound was PFOA. The origin and growing region are possible factors with the potential to influence PFASs distribution profile and their levels in food.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Previous interventions have reported desirable effects of diets rich in whole grains or rich in fruits and vegetables on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and weight management. However, data are lacking regarding the effect of these fiber sources separately. The aim of this randomized clinical feeding trial was to investigate the effects of fiber-rich diets with different sources of fiber (fruits, vegetables, and whole grains) on weight loss and CVD risk factors in overweight and obese women. METHODS: Overweight and obese women (N = 75) were randomized to one of three weight loss diets that were rich in whole grains, fruits and vegetables, or both for 10 weeks. Body weight, waist circumference, and risk factors of CVD were examined at baseline and 10 weeks. RESULTS: During the 10-week dietary intervention phase, the reductions in weight (p = 0.03), waist circumference (p = 0.001), systolic blood pressure (p = 0.04), fasting blood sugar (p = 0.03), and triglycerides (p = 0.001) were higher in the whole grains group compared with the fruits and vegetables group or the combination diet group. Also, the whole grain group had a greater increase (p = 0.01) in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared to the other groups. The change in other risk factors, including diastolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, was not different among the three diet groups. Within-group comparisons revealed significant reductions in weight, waist circumference, and fasting blood sugar in all groups. Only the fruits and vegetables group and the whole grains group had significant decreases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol over 10 weeks (p ≤ 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: This trial suggests that in overweight and obese women, a weight loss diet rich in whole grains may have a more beneficial effect on CVD risk factors than diets rich in fruits and vegetables or a combination of whole grains and fruits and vegetables.",

SETTING: Title I elementary schools in a large, urban district in central Virginia. PARTICIPANTS: Students (grades 1-5; >95% African American) from 2 elementary schools participated in plate waste assessments (282 plates were rated at baseline, 443 at post-assessment); fourth- and fifth-grade students from 15 (of 18 eligible) schools (n = 1,193) responded to surveys. INTERVENTION: Digital imagery plate waste assessments were conducted before salad bars were installed (baseline) and 1 month afterward (post). Post-surveys examined student perceptions of salad bars. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fruit and vegetable selection, consumption, and waste. ANALYSIS: General linear models (without considering clustering) examined changes in outcomes, controlling for school. Frequencies and qualitative analyses were applied to survey data. RESULTS: At post, students selected more types of FVs (1.81-2.58; P < .001), although FV consumption decreased by 0.65 cups (P < .001). Given the smaller portions selected, there was less FV waste (0.27 cups; P < .001) at post. Students liked the ability to choose FV from salad bars. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Short-term exposure to salad bars increased the number of FV students chose but decreased FV consumption. Additional strategies are needed to increase FV consumption.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this quasi-experimental pilot intervention, 180 third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade students in Los Angeles Unified School District participated in a 3-week program that included three Virtual Sprouts gaming sessions, three in-school lessons, and three in-home activities, using a nutrition- and gardening-focused curriculum. Pre- and postintervention questionnaires were used to assess psychosocial determinants of dietary behavior, including knowledge about and self-efficacy to eat fruits and vegetables (FV). Data were collected on FV, whole grains, fiber, total sugar, added sugar, and energy from sugary beverages through the Block Kids Food Screener (\"last week\" version) for Ages 2-17. Repeated measures analysis of covariance models was used for continuous outcomes, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, school, and free school lunch. RESULTS: After the intervention, the intervention group (n = 116) compared with the control group (n = 64) had a significantly improved self-efficacy to eat FV score (+1.6% vs. -10.3%, P = 0.01), and an improved self-efficacy to cook FV score (+2.9% vs. -5.0%, P = 0.05). There were no significant differences in dietary intake or self-efficacy to garden scores between intervention and control groups. CONCLUSION: The results from this 3-week pilot study suggest that an interactive mobile game with a nutrition- and gardening-focused curriculum can improve psychosocial determinants of dietary behavior in minority youth.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Weight loss interventions have not been advocated for overweight/obese older adults due to potential loss of skeletal muscle and strength impacting on physical function with potential loss of independence. Carotenoids and polyphenols are inversely associated with sarcopenic symptomology. This paper reports the protocol of a study evaluating the efficacy of a high-protein, energy restricted diet rich in carotenoids and polyphenols on body composition, muscle strength, physical performance and quality of life in overweight and obese older adults. METHODS: This randomised controlled clinical trial will recruit community-dwelling, healthy overweight and obese older adults (≥60 years) for a 12-week weight loss intervention. Seventy-three participants will be recruited and randomized to an energy restricted (~30% restriction), isocaloric diet (30% protein; 30% carbohydrate; 40% fat) enriched with either: a) 375 g/d of high carotenoid vegetables, 300 g/d high carotenoid fruit, and 40-60 ml extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO); or b) 375 g/d of lower carotenoid vegetables, 300 g/d lower carotenoid fruit, and 40-60 ml Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) based oil. All participants will receive individual dietary counselling each fortnight for the duration of the study and will be asked to maintain their habitual level of physical activity throughout the study. The primary outcome will be appendicular skeletal muscle (ASM) assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Secondary outcomes will include body weight, fat-free mass (FFM), fat mass (FM), muscle strength (Isometric hand-grip strength), physical performance (Short Physical Performance Battery), physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) and health related quality of life (SF-36). Outcomes will be measured at baseline and at week 12. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will provide a novel insight relating to the potential influence of high carotenoid and polyphenol intakes on attenuation of ASM during dietary energy-restricted weight loss in overweight and obese older adults.

DESIGN: Randomized controlled design. Purchases were tracked using a loyalty card that provided participants with a 5% discount on all purchases during a 3-month baseline period followed by the 4-month intervention. SETTING: A supermarket in a low-income rural Maine community. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 401 low-income and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) supermarket customers. INTERVENTION: Same-day coupon at checkout for half-off eligible fresh, frozen, or canned F&V over 4 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Weekly spending in dollars on eligible F&V. ANALYSIS: A linear model with random intercepts accounted for repeated transactions by individuals to estimate change in F&V spending per week from baseline to intervention. Secondary analyses examined changes among SNAP-eligible participants. RESULTS: Coupons were redeemed among 53% of eligible baskets. Total weekly F&V spending increased in the intervention arm compared with control ($1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], $0.29 to $3.88). The largest increase was for fresh F&V ($1.97; 95% CI, $0.49 to $3.44). Secondary analyses revealed greater increases in F&V spending among SNAP-eligible participants who redeemed coupons ($5.14; 95% CI, $1.93 to $8.34) than among non-SNAP eligible participants who redeemed coupons ($3.88; 95% CI, $1.67 to $6.08). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: A double-dollar pricing incentive increased F&V spending in a low-income community despite the moderate uptake of the coupon redemption. Customers who were eligible for SNAP saw the greatest F&V spending increases. Financial incentives for F&V are an effective strategy for food assistance programs to increase healthy purchases and improve dietary intake in low-income families.",

Design/Setting Participants were interviewed to collect food security status, home availability of variety of F&V and frequency of F&V intake. Bivariate analyses, multivariate regression and exploratory mediation analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics version 23.0 and the PROCESS macro. SUBJECTS: Low-income pregnant women (n 198) were interviewed if they were ≥18 years of age, in the second trimester of pregnancy, and spoke English or Spanish. RESULTS: Low/very low food security was found among 43 % of participants. Compared with fully food-secure participants, very low food-secure participants reported a lower variety of fruits (P=0·028) and vegetables (P=0·058) available at home. Mediation analyses indicated that through home availability of variety of fresh F&V, food security status was associated with the daily intake of F&V (indirect effect (95 % CI): fresh fruits, -0·039 (-0·074, -0·013); fresh vegetables, -0·048 (-0·083, -0·023)). As food security worsened, the available variety of fresh F&V decreased, which was associated with lower intake. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the interlink between food security, home food environment and diet quality, and the importance of nutrition education intervention to promote a healthy home food environment and improved pregnancy outcomes among low-income women.",

The present review provides an update of the scientific literature on additive and synergistic effects of mixtures of phytochemicals. Most research has been carried out in in vitro systems in which synergistic or additive effects have been established on the level of cell proliferation, apoptosis, antioxidant capacity, and tumor incidence, accompanied by changes in gene and protein expression in relevant pathways underlying molecular mechanisms of disease prevention. The number of human dietary intervention studies investigating complex mixtures of phytochemicals is relatively small, but showing promising results. These studies have demonstrated that combining transcriptomic data with phenotypic markers provide insight into the relevant cellular processes which contribute to the antioxidant response of complex mixtures of phytochemicals. Future studies should be designed as short-term studies testing different combinations of vegetables and fruit, in which markers for disease outcome as well as molecular ('omics)-markers and genetic variability between subjects are included. This will create new opportunities for food innovation and the development of more personalized strategies for prevention of chronic diseases.",

Whether the same is true in humans is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of preconception intake of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables (FVs) with outcomes of infertility treatment with assisted reproductive technologies (ART). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This analysis included 325 women who completed a diet assessment and subsequently underwent 541 ART cycles in the Environment and Reproductive Health (EARTH) prospective cohort study (2007-2016) at a fertility center at a teaching hospital. We categorized FVs as having high or low pesticide residues using a validated method based on surveillance data from the US Department of Agriculture. Cluster-weighted generalized estimating equations were used to analyze associations of high- and low-pesticide residue FV intake with ART outcomes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adjusted probabilities of clinical pregnancy and live birth per treatment cycle. RESULTS: In the 325 participants (mean [SD] age, 35.1 [4.0] y; body mass index, 24.1 [4.3]), mean (SD) intakes of high- and low-pesticide residue FVs were 1.7 (1.0) and 2.8 (1.6) servings/d, respectively. Greater intake of high-pesticide residue FVs was associated with a lower probability of clinical pregnancy and live birth. Compared with women in the lowest quartile of high-pesticide FV intake (<1.0 servings/d), women in the highest quartile (≥2.3 servings/d) had 18% (95% CI, 5%-30%) lower probability of clinical pregnancy and 26% (95% CI, 13%-37%) lower probability of live birth. Intake of low-pesticide residue FVs was not significantly related to ART outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Higher consumption of high-pesticide residue FVs was associated with lower probabilities of pregnancy and live birth following infertility treatment with ART. These data suggest that dietary pesticide exposure within the range of typical human exposure may be associated with adverse reproductive consequences.",

However, mechanical operations of cutting and peeling induce the liberation of cellular contents at the site of wounding that can promote the growth of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms. In addition, rates of tissue senescence can be enhanced resulting in reduced storage life of fresh-cut fruits and vegetables. Chlorine has been widely adopted in the disinfection and washing procedures of fresh-cut produce due to its low cost and efficacy against a broad spectrum of microorganisms. Continuous replenishment of chlorine in high organic wash water can promote the formation of carcinogenic compounds such as trihalomethanes, which threaten human and environmental health. Alternative green and innovative chemical and physical postharvest treatments such as ozone, electrolyzed water, hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet radiation, high pressure processing, and ultrasound can achieve similar reduction of microorganisms as chlorine without the production of harmful compounds or compromising the quality of fresh-cut produce.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The increase in overweight and obesity in adolescents and its health-related consequences highlight the need to develop strategies, which could help them adopt healthy eating habits. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of an innovative web-based school nutrition intervention (Team Nutriathlon) aimed at promoting the consumption of vegetables and fruit (V/F) and milk and alternatives (M/A) in high school students and to identify facilitators and/or barriers influencing its success. METHODS: Ten classes of first and second year secondary students (grades 7 and 8) from the Québec City region were randomized into two groups (control n = 89 and intervention n = 193). Participants in the intervention (Team Nutriathlon) were to increase their consumption of V/F and M/A using an innovative web-based platform, developed for this study, over 6 weeks. The control group followed the regular school curriculum. The number of servings of V/F and M/A consumed by students per day was compared between the two groups before, during, immediately after and 10 weeks after the intervention using a web-based platform. Main outcome measures included V/F and M/A servings and facilitators and/or barriers of program success. Repeated measures linear fixed effects models were used to assess the impact of Team Nutriathlon on V/F and M/A consumption. A P-value of <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Students in the intervention reported a significant increase of 3 servings and 1.8 servings per day of V/F and M/A, respectively, compared to the control group (P < 0.05); however, this was only observed in the short-term. Some factors contributing to the success of Team Nutriathlon included the team aspect of the program, use of the technology and recording results outside of classroom hours. CONCLUSION: Team Nutriathlon represents an innovative web-based nutrition program which positively impacts V/F and M/A consumption among high school students. Using web-based or technological platforms may help youth adopt healthy eating habits that will have implications later in adulthood; however, further studies are needed to determine their long-term effects.

      "abstract": "Consumers currently demand more nutritious food, which is minimally processed and naturally produced. Flavonoids are one of the major plant metabolites found throughout the plant kingdom, especially in fruits and vegetables. Flavonoids exert tremendous positive effects on health and protect against various diseases. Fruits and vegetables are difficult to store for a long period, owing to their perishable nature even at low temperatures. Therefore, processing is necessary to prolong their shelf lives and increase nutritional values. Thermal processing has been used in the food sector since ancient times. However, nonthermal processing has become more attractive to consumers and product developers recently, owing to the retention of beneficial health properties after nonthermal processing. The present review will address the effects of thermal and nonthermal processing methods such as blanching, drying, high-pressure processing, ultrasound, pulsed electric field, and ultraviolet irradiation on total and individual flavonoid content in fruits and vegetables. In addition, this text will elucidate the stability characteristics as well as bioavailability, cytotoxicity, and transformations of flavonoids during thermal and nonthermal treatments.",

This study evaluated the ability of three organic acids, namely, acetic acid, citric acid and lactic acid to manage E. coli and Salmonella sp. from fresh fruits and vegetables. Effect of these organic acids on biofilm forming ability and anti-quorum potential was also investigated. The effect of organic acids on inactivation of E. coli and Salmonella sp. on the surface of a selected vegetable (cucumber) was determined. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the organic acids were found to be 1.5, 2 and 0.2% in E. coli while it was observed to be 1, 1.5 and 1% in Salmonella sp. for acetic, citric and lactic acids respectively. Maximum inhibition of biofilm formation was recorded at 39.13% with lactic acid in E. coli and a minimum of 22.53% with citric acid in Salmonella sp. EPS production was affected in E. coli with lactic acid showing reduction by 13.42% while citric acid and acetic acid exhibited only 6.25% and 10.89% respectively. Swimming and swarming patterns in E. coli was notably affected by both acetic and lactic acids. Lactic and acetic acids showed higher anti-quorum sensing (QS) potential when compared to citric acid. 2% lactic acid showed a maximum inhibition of violacein production by 37.7%. Organic acids can therefore be used as potential quorum quenching agents in food industry. 2% lactic acid treatment on cucumber demonstrated that it was effective in inactivating E. coli and Salmonella sp. There was 1 log reduction in microbial count over a period of 6 days after the lactic acid treatment. Thus, organic acids can act as effective potential sanitizers in reducing the microbial load associated with fresh fruits and vegetables.",

      "abstract": "The presence of pesticide residues in primary and derived agricultural products raises serious health concerns for consumers. The aim of this study was to assess the level of pesticide residues in commonly consumed fruits and vegetables in Kuwait. A total of 150 samples of different fresh vegetables and fruits were analyzed for the presence of 34 pesticides using the quick easy cheap effective rugged and safe (QuEChERS) multi-residue extraction, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Pesticide residues above the maximum residue limits (MRL) were detected in 21% of the samples and 79% of the samples had no residues of the pesticides surveyed or contained residues below the MRL. Multiple residues were present in 40% of the samples with two to four pesticides, and four samples were contaminated with more than four pesticide residues. Of the pesticides investigated, 16 were detected, of which imidacloprid, deltamethrin, cypermethrin, malathion, acetamiprid, monocrotophos, chlorpyrifos-methyl, and diazinon exceeded their MRLs. Aldrin, an organochlorine pesticide, was detected in one apple sample, with residues below the MRL. The results indicate the occurrence of pesticide residues in commonly consumed fruits and vegetables in Kuwait, and pointed to an urgent need to develop comprehensive intervention measures to reduce the potential health risk to consumers. The need for the regular monitoring of pesticide residues and the sensitization of farmers to better pesticide safety practices, especially the need to adhere to recommended pre-harvest intervals is recommended.",

A range of palliative medicines comprising proton pump inhibitors, H2 receptor antagonists, COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs) is widely in use and patients have also been administered with acid suppression therapies. But these remedies aggravate the condition of patients causing severe side effects, or rather impart temporary relief. Therefore, it is highly imperative to develop safe and effective therapies for the treatment of gastric ulcer. Nature provides us various fruits and vegetables that can combat gastric ulcer through multiple mechanisms; predominantly via antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antisecretory, antimicrobial, anticholinergic and cytoprotective activity, inhibition of small intestinal propulsion etc. Various phytochemicals from fruits and vegetables such as phenolics, flavonoids, tannins and saponins play a vital role in the prevention and cure of gastric ulcer. This review is a compendium of all fruits and vegetables known for their profound antiulcer effect and their underlying mechanisms of action.",

METHODS: In this research, three fruits and three vegetables produced in Shanghai were selected as the materials, 54 pesticide residues were detected with the ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UPLC-MS/MS) method on the basis of optimized QuEChERS method according to different materials properties. RESULTS: The results showed that: all samples were directly extracted by acetonitrile containing 1% (v/v) acetic acid; complex matrix samples were purified by a mixed sorbent of 300mg MgSO4+100mg PSA+100mg C18+0.01g Carb, general matrix samples didn't add Carb, simple matrix samples such as watermelon directly filmed; Chromatographic column was ZORBAX Eclipse Plus-C18 column (3.0mm×150mm, 3.5μm) at 40°C, the methanol-water of mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.45mL/min by a gradient elution contained 0.1% formic acid and 5mmol/L ammonium acetate and the injection volume was 1μL. With switching electrospray ion source polarity, [M-H]- and high sensitive [M+Na]＋were respectively the precursor ions of eight pesticides and avermectin, [M+H]＋ was those of the else 45 pesticides. The detection parameters of multi-reactions monitoring (MRM) with simultaneously positive and negative ions (electron multiplier voltage was 200V) scanning were set as follows: the 310.3kPa of nebulizer pressure, the 300°C of drying gas temperature, the 7L/min of drying gas flow, the 3000V and 3500V of respectively capillary positive and negative voltage. With the optimized method, the calibration curves of 54 pesticides were better linear in 15-500μg/kg (r ≥0.988), the average adding standard recovery rates of 54 pesticides were 73.2%-134.3% except pymetrozine and cyromazine with the relative standard deviations (RSD) of 1.0%-13.8%; the limit of detection (LOD) under three times signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and limit of quantitative (LOQ) under 10 times S/N were respectively confirmed 0.003-2.000μg/kg and 0.01-6.67μg/kg. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that the optimized \"QuEChERS-UPLC-MS/MS method\" was a simple, rapid, sensitive, accurate, efficient, economical and safe method that simultaneously detected multiple pesticide residues through one time sample treatment; It had some advantages such as more pesticides per detection, simple and convenient pretreatment and less solvent dosage to be suitable for the quick high-throughput quantitative screening and confirmation of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables.",

Ruminant manure is a primary source of E. coli O157:H7 contaminating the environment and food sources. Therefore, effective interventions targeted at reducing the prevalence of fecal excretion of E. coli O157:H7 by cattle and sheep and the elimination of E. coli O157:H7 contamination of meat products as well as fruits and vegetables are required. Bacteriophages offer the prospect of sustainable alternative approaches against bacterial pathogens with the flexibility of being applied therapeutically or for biological control purposes. This article reviews the use of phages administered orally or rectally to ruminants and by spraying or immersion of fruits and vegetables as an antimicrobial strategy for controlling E. coli O157:H7. The few reports available demonstrate the potential of phage therapy to reduce E. coli O157:H7 carriage in cattle and sheep, and preparation of commercial phage products was recently launched into commercial markets. However, a better ecological understanding of the phage E. coli O157:H7 will improve antimicrobial effectiveness of phages for elimination of E. coli O157:H7 in vivo.",

This study examined the association between objective, GIS-derived supermarket proximity and fruit and vegetable serving frequency, using data from 623 English nurseries. Overall, 116 (18%) nurseries served fruits and vegetables infrequently (<2-3 times/week), but provision differed by supermarket proximity. In adjusted multivariable regression models, nurseries farthest from their nearest supermarket (Q5, 1.7-19.8km) had 2.38 (95% CI 1.01-5.63) greater odds of infrequent provision.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Investments have been made to alter the food environment of neighbourhoods that have a disproportionate number of unhealthy food venues. Corner store conversions are one strategy to increase access to fruits and vegetables (F&V). Although the literature shows modest success, the effectiveness of these interventions remains equivocal. The present paper reports on the evaluation of Proyecto MercadoFRESCO, a corner store conversion intervention in two Latino communities. DESIGN: A repeated cross-sectional design was employed. Data were stratified by intervention arm and bivariate tests assessed changes over time. Logistic and multiple regression models with intervention arm, time and the interaction of intervention and time were conducted. Supplementary analyses account for clustering of patrons within stores and staggering of store conversions. SETTING: Three stores were converted and five stores served as comparisons in East Los Angeles and Boyle Heights, California, USA. SUBJECTS: Store patrons were interviewed before (n550) and after (n407) the intervention. RESULTS: Relative to patrons of comparison stores, patrons of intervention stores demonstrated more favourable perceptions of corner stores and increased purchasing of F&V during that store visit. Changes were not detected in store patronage, percentage of weekly dollars spent on food for F&V or daily consumption of F&V. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with some extant food environment literature, findings demonstrate limited effects. Investments should be made in multilevel, comprehensive interventions that target a variety retail food outlets rather than focusing on corner stores exclusively. Complementary policies limiting the availability, affordability and marketing of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods should also be pursued.",

The intervention contributed to a significant increase in the household availability of fruit and vegetables (+2.7 p.p.; 95%CI: 1.5; 4.0), contrary to the trend towards stagnation of such availability in the general population in Brazil. Meanwhile, the purchase of sodas and cookies, which was not the intervention's target, mirrored the upward trend in the consumption of these products (+5.8 p.p.; 95%CI: 3.3; 8.4). Families that increased their purchase of sodas and cookies showed lower increases, or even decreases, in the purchase of fruits and vegetables (p < 0.05), and had nearly fourfold lower odds of experiencing any increase in the household availability of fruits and vegetables.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Food co-op models have gained popularity as a mechanism for offering affordable, quality produce. We describe the challenges, successes, and lessons learned from implementation of a school-based program using a food co-op model combined with nutrition education to improve access to and intake of fresh fruits and vegetables among low-income children and their families. METHODS: Brighter Bites is a 16-week intervention comprising of fresh produce deliveries, recipe demonstrations, and nutrition education. A mixed-methods approach was used comprising survey and focus group data collected from Brighter Bites staff, parents, and teachers. Descriptive statistics and frequencies were computed for the survey data collected. RESULTS: Brighter Bites was implemented across 9 schools, serving a total of 1530 predominantly low-income families in the 2013-2014 school year. Brighter Bites distributed an average 60.2 servings of fresh fruits and vegetables per family per week. Lessons learned included the importance of leveraging existing infrastructure of food banks and schools to implement the program, early school and parent engagement, and incorporating strategies to track and optimize engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Clear expectations and reliable partnerships are keys to the delivery of the Brighter Bites program.",
