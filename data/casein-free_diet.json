      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Numerous therapeutic and dietary interventions have been examined in the last thirty years for pediatric patients diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our interventional study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the gluten-free, casein-free (GFCF) diet in a cohort of Egyptian children with ASD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present clinical trial was conducted as a prospective 12-month, open-label, case-controlled interventional study. Thirty-six ASD children who were newly diagnosed and had not taken any prior psychiatric or rehabilitation therapy were included in this study. The patients were randomly assigned into two groups: group A, which received the GFCF diet, and group B, which served as the control group and was not restricted to food containing gluten and casein for 12 months. All patients were followed up for 1 year. RESULTS: Following the implementation of the GFCF diet in group A, significant improvements in CARS scores were observed compared to group B after 6-month and 1-year follow-up periods. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of the GFCF diet could be helpful and promising for autistic children. Conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of the GFCF diet remains a subject of controversy. Nonetheless, our study contributes some evidence supporting its potential benefits for children with ASD. It is recommended that future research on the GFCF diet employ a more sophisticated research design, incorporating a consistent baseline measure that can effectively assess the therapeutic effects of these interventions for individuals with ASD."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: It has been suggested that a gluten-free and casein-free (GFCF) diet may alleviate the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and facilitate neurodevelopment of children with ASD. Studies to date have been inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate (through quantitative meta-analysis) the efficacy and safety of a GFCF diet for children with ASD. To our knowledge, this is the first time such an analysis has been carried out. DATA SOURCES: Eight electronic databases were searched, from the establishment of each database up to March 27, 2020: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP databases. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently performed the data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment. DATA ANALYSIS: A quantitative meta-analysis was performed with standard procedures by using Stata SE 15 software. Within the total of 8 studies, with 297 participants, 5 studies reported significant reductions in stereotypical behaviors [standard mean difference (SMD) = -0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.68 to -0.15], and 3 studies reported improvements in cognition (SMD = -0.46, 95% CI: -0.91 to -0.01) following GFCF dietary intervention . No statistically significant changes were observed in other symptomatic categories (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The current meta-analysis showed that a GFCF diet can reduce stereotypical behaviors and improve the cognition of children with ASD. Though most of the included studies were single-blind, the benefits of a GFCF diet that have been indicated are promising. Additional studies on a larger scale are warranted.

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder [ASD] is characterized by deficits in communication and social interactions combined with repetitive and restricted patterns of behaviors. Bidirectional changes in brain-gut microbiota are known to be responsible for the pathophysiology of many brain-related disorders, such as autism, as well as well-known gastrointestinal diseases, including gut disorders. Imbalance in the composition of gut microbiota is frequently observed in individuals with ASD. It is therefore believed that this imbalance is significant in the frequent occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms. The integrity of the intestinal barrier and the blood-brain barrier [BBB] in individuals with ASD is affected. Incompletely digested peptides, toxins, and proinflammatory cytokines cross the BBB by entering the bloodstream and reach the central nervous system. As a result of the accumulation of these elements, brain function is adversely affected. It is hypothesized that incompletely digested peptides acting as opioid agonists reduce pain sensitivity and increase the severity of autism-specific behaviors. However, it is not known exactly how opioid peptides trigger ASD symptoms after they reach the brain. Diet therapies, especially elimination diets, are considered to be an alternative treatment to prevent this condition. Gluten-free casein-free [GFCF] diet is an elimination diet that involves the removal of certain proteins from the normal diet, such as gluten and casein. However, studies that demonstrate the beneficial effects of the GFCF diet on ASD patients and explain its mechanism is limited, which supports the opioid theory. This review aims to investigate the gastrointestinal and behavioral problems that are frequently observed in ASD, the possible action mechanisms of GFCF diets, and the efficacy of these elimination diets."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gluten-free and casein-free diet is frequently used in the support of therapy of children with autism spectrum disorders. In addition, many parents restrict the consumption of simple sugars for their children. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to understand factors influencing purchase decision in case of family with children with autism spectrum disorders on gluten-free and/or casein-free and/or sugar-free diet and the difficulties associated with this type of nutrition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study covered a group of 40 families with children with autism spectrum disorders (32 boys and 8 girls) aged 3 to 10 years. Data were collected with questionnaire included questions concerning overall characteristics of caregivers, availability of foods used in the special diet, factors affecting decision on the purchase of products, difficulties in maintaining the child nutrition method. RESULTS: The factors having strongest impact on parents' decisions on the purchase of products were product composition, presence of a certificate confirming the absence of gluten and/or milk and taste values. Exclusion diet constituted a considerable obstruction for traveling, social gatherings and resulted in conflicts with family and the environment. The limited range of healthy gluten-free, casein-free and sugar-free foods, low taste quality and unsatisfactory quality impeded purchase and preparation of varied meals. CONCLUSIONS: The surveyed parents were aware consumers, paying attention primarily to product composition and safety. The respondents were looking for healthy, organic and nutritionally valuable products with low sugar content. Further development of the gluten/casein/ sugar free products market may considerably improve certain aspects of family's life with children with autism spectrum disorders.",

Our aims were to determine the influence of a GFCF diet on behavior disorders in children and adolescents diagnosed with ASD and the potential association with urinary beta-casomorphin concentrations. Thirty-seven patients were recruited for this crossover trial. Each patient consumed a normal diet (including gluten and casein) for 6 months and a GFCF diet for another 6 months. The order of the intervention (beginning with normal diet or with GFCF diet) was assigned randomly. Patients were evaluated at three time-points (at the beginning of the study, after normal diet and after GFCF diet). Questionnaires regarding behavior and autism and dietary adherence were completed and urinary beta-casomorphin concentrations were determined at each time-point. No significant behavioral changes and no association with urinary beta-casomorphin concentrations were found after GFCF diet. A 6-month GFCF diet do not induce significant changes in behavioral symptoms of autism and urinary beta-casomorphin concentrations. Further studies with a long follow-up period similar to ours and including placebo and blinding elements are needed to identify better those respondents to GFCF diets.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Many diet regimens were studied for patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) over the past few years. Ketogenic diet is gaining attention due to its proven effect on neurological conditions like epilepsy in children. Forty-five children aged 3-8 years diagnosed with ASD based on DSM-5 criteria were enrolled in this study. Patients were equally divided into 3 groups, first group received ketogenic diet as modified Atkins diet (MAD), second group received gluten free casein free (GFCF) diet and the third group received balanced nutrition and served as a control group. All patients were assessed in terms of neurological examination, anthropometric measures, as well as Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Autism Treatment Evaluation Test (ATEC) scales before and 6 months after starting diet. Both diet groups showed significant improvement in ATEC and CARS scores in comparison to control group, yet ketogenic scored better results in cognition and sociability compared to GFCF diet group. Depending on the parameters measured in our study, modified Atkins diet and gluten free casein free diet regimens may safely improve autistic manifestations and could be recommended for children with ASD. At this stage, this study is a single center study with a small number of patients and a great deal of additional wide-scale prospective studies are however needed to confirm these results.

We systematically updated evidence on the effectiveness of a gluten-free and casein-free (GFCF) diet as a treatment for ASD in children. METHODS: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases were searched up until August 2016, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs); additional references were obtained from reviewed articles. RESULTS: Six RCTs (214 participants) were included. With few exceptions, there were no statistically significant differences in autism spectrum disorder core symptoms between groups, as measured by standardized scales. One trial found that compared with the control group, in the GFCF diet group there were significant improvements in the scores for the 'communication' subdomain of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and for the 'social interaction' subdomain of the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale. Another trial found significant differences between groups in the post-intervention scores for the 'autistic traits', 'communication', and 'social contact' subdomains of a standardized Danish scheme. The remaining differences, if present, referred to parent-based assessment tools or other developmental/ASD-related features. No adverse events associated with a GFCF diet were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is little evidence that a GFCF diet is beneficial for the symptoms of ASD in children.",

Other research suggests that children diagnosed with ASD can be classified into subpopulations based on various factors, including gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities and immune function. METHODS: This study analyzes parental report data collected using a 90-item online questionnaire from 387 parents or primary caregivers of children diagnosed with ASD on the efficacy of the GFCF diet. Parents reported on their child's GI symptoms, food allergy diagnoses, and suspected food sensitivities, as well as the degree and length of their diet implementation. RESULTS: Overall, diet efficacy among children whose parents reported the presence of GI symptoms, food allergy diagnoses, and suspected food sensitivities included greater improvement in ASD behaviors, physiological symptoms, and social behaviors compared with children whose parents reported none of these symptoms, diagnoses, or sensitivities (P < 0.05). Parental report of strict diet implementation, indicated by complete gluten/casein elimination and infrequent diet errors during and outside of parental care, also corresponded to improvement in ASD behaviors, physiological symptoms, and social behaviors (P < 0.05). DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that various intricacies related to diet implementation and GI and immune factors may play a role in differentiating diet responders from diet non-responders and substantiate the importance of further investigations into the various, nuanced factors that influence efficacy of the intervention among children with ASDs.",

Subsequently, various therapies were introduced when he was 5 months old yet the developmental delays persisted. Gastrointestinal problems such as frequent post-prandial vomiting and severe constipation were noted as well. At the age of 42 months, the boy was subjected to a gluten and casein-free diet. Soybean milk and rice were substituted for cow's milk, bread and noodles. After 2.5 months, interpersonal relations including eye to eye contact and verbal communication improved. At 5.5 months the boy was capable of playing and sharing toys with his sibling and other children, behavior noted to be closer to that of an unaffected child. In addition, the decreased frequency of postprandial vomiting led to a significant increment in body weight, body height (from below the third percentile to the tenth percentile) and vitality after 11 months on the diet. In view of the lack of consensus on the benefits of dietary intervention in patients with autism, we are suggesting an adjuvant therapy that is simple, safe and economical. In addition, the therapy may be more feasible in Taiwan as opposed to western countries because of cultural factors such as dietary preference and product availability.",
