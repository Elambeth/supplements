      "abstract": "Renal fibrosis is a critical progression of chronic kidney disease, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and extracellular matrix(ECM) deposition are crucial pathologic change of renal fibrosis, which still lacks of effective treatment. In this study, it was found that cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) could inhibit EMT and ECM activated by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) stimulation. Moreover, N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 2(NDRG2), which involved in the progression of renal fibrosis, was down-regulated in vivo and in vitro model. However, C3G pretreatment could reverse the reductive expression of NDRG2. Furthermore, we found that the combined treatment of C3G and si-NDRG2 could reverse the decreased EMT and ECM, which induced by C3G treatment only. And the activation of Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/ Protein Kinase B (AKT) pathway significantly enhanced EMT and ECM, which was decreased by C3G treatment only in TGF-β1 induced Human Kidney 2 (HK-2) cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that C3G alleviated EMT and ECM by elevating NDRG2 expression through the PI3K/AKT pathway, indicating that C3G could be a potential treatment against renal fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "The study is to explore the biosynthesis of cyanidin-3-glucoside-4-vinylcatechol (C3G_VC) through Lactiplantibacillus plantarum-fermented caffeic acid and cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) extract (molar ratio = 1:30) in the model medium. C3G_VC was isolated and purified by a venusil ASB-C18 column with a medium-pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) system. The chemical structure of C3G_VC was identified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which showed the maximum absorption wavelength of 505.57 nm. This study showed that Cd exposure of mice induced liver damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation of the gut microbiome. Our findings demonstrated that C3G_VC intervention in Cd-exposed mice significantly mitigated oxidative stress injury by declining the malondialdehyde (MDA) level and increasing the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) in the liver, meanwhile alleviating liver injury by decreasing the bile acid (BA) level and accelerating the excretion of fecal BA. Moreover, the Cd_C3G_VC group showed elevated levels of mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL6, IL1β, and TNF-α) and inhibited BA synthesis (CYP7A1) in Cd-exposed mice. The fermentation results in vitro showed that C3G_VC had a higher residue than that of cyanidin-3-glucoside. The 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing disclosed that C3G_VC intervention in Cd-exposed mice significantly increased the abundance of Faecalibaculum and unidentified_Lachnospiraceae. It is noteworthy that the C3G_VC supplement increased the abundance of Akkermansia. Overall, this study demonstrated that C3G_VC intervention in Cd-exposed mice had the potential to decrease the occurrence of inflammatory and oxidative stress and maintain bile acid homeostasis by regulating gut microflora.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (Cy3g) is a natural anthocyanin, showing favorable anti-cancer efficacy in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, its specific mechanism in CRC remains largely unexplored. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of Cy3g on CRC. METHODS: Cell viability of human CRC cell lines (SW620, HT29, LS174T, and HCT116) and normal colon fibroblast cell line (CCD-18Co) treated with Cy3g was detected by CCK-8. Effects of Cy3g on malignant characteristics of SW620 cells were determined by CCK-8, EdU, colony formation, wound healing, Transwell, and flow cytometry assays. To further elucidate Cy3g's mechanism in CRC, KLF4 expression was detected by RT-qPCR, and expression of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and p38 was examined by western blotting. The effects and mechanisms of Cy3g on CRC progression were further validated in a xenograft mouse model. RESULTS: Cy3g significantly inhibited the cell viability of human CRC cell lines but rarely affected the cell viability of normal colon fibroblast. Cy3g dose-dependently inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion and promoted apoptosis of SW620 cells. Moreover, Cy3g upregulated KLF4 expression and inactivated the ERK/p38 pathway in a concentration-dependent manner. KLF4 knockdown reversed the inhibitory effects of Cy3g on the malignant characteristics of SW620 and expression of ERK and p38. Animal experiments further validated that Cy3g inhibited tumor growth without altering body weight, activated KLF4, and suppressed the ERK/p38 pathway in CRC model mice. CONCLUSION: Cy3g inhibits CRC progression by suppressing the KLF4-mediated ERK/p38 pathway, offering new insights into CRC prevention and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are emerging as promising therapeutic agents due to their immunomodulatory effects, primarily mediated via paracrine signaling. Similarly, anthocyanins, such as cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), have demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory properties. In this context, this study investigated the immunomodulatory potential of C3G on MSCs, and subsequent effects on macrophage and lymphocyte responses. Cytotoxicity assays identified 50 µM as the highest nontoxic C3G concentration for MSCs. Flow cytometry confirmed that C3G treatment did not affect MSC viability or cell cycle distribution, even under LPS stimulation. Cytokine production by MSCs was evaluated after treatment with C3G and LPS. While no significant changes were observed in IL-6, IL-10, TGF-β, or PGE2 levels, IL-1β production was significantly reduced in LPS-stimulated MSCs treated with C3G. Protein expression analysis revealed decreased NFκB phosphorylation in LPS-stimulated MSCs treated with C3G, with no changes detected in STAT-3 or PCNA expression. The immunomodulatory effects of MSC-derived conditioned media on macrophages and lymphocytes were also assessed. In LPS-stimulated macrophages, conditioned media from MSCs reduced the production of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-12. Interestingly, conditioned media from C3G-treated MSCs specifically decreased TNF-α levels, enhanced IL-10 secretion, and further inhibited NFκB phosphorylation. In LPS-stimulated lymphocytes, conditioned media from C3G-treated MSCs suppressed IL-2 production while increasing IL-10 levels. In summary, these findings demonstrate that conditioned media from C3G-treated MSCs modulates immune cell responses more effectively than C3G alone. C3G influences the paracrine activity of MSCs, resulting in a shift in the secretory profile and subsequent effects on immune cell behavior.",

      "abstract": "Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) remains a significant global health issue, affecting millions despite a decrease in overall prevalence. However, complications continue to persist, with substantial mortality rates in regions like India and China. Current treatments, though effective, have limitations, driving interest in plant-derived therapy. Anthocyanins, including cyanidin and cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aims to explore the potential of cyanidin and C3G in alleviating PUD, focusing on their mechanisms of action and therapeutic efficacy in preclinical studies. Articles were searched in Scopus and PubMed databases and filtered for publication from 2014 to 2024, resulting in 89 articles from Scopus and 11 articles from PubMed. The articles were further screened by title, abstract, and full text, resulting in 6 articles. Cyanidin and C3G were described to be able to alleviate PUD by inhibiting the cytokine pro-inflammatory, reducing inflammation in gastric mucosa, and reducing lipid peroxidation in the gastric mucosa. These compounds have proven effective in managing other health problems, including peptic ulcers, but more in-depth exploration in clinical settings is required to confirm therapeutic potential in humans. It is necessary to validate the therapeutic efficacy and safety in human populations. This review provides an overview of preclinical studies of cyanidin and C3G, such as in vitro and in vivo, focusing on mechanism of action or their effectiveness in alleviating peptic ulcers.",

      "abstract": "Anthocyanins, water-soluble flavonoids found in fruits and vegetables, exhibit diverse biological activities, with cyanidin being the most common pigment. While cyanidin's chemo preventive and -antioxidant activity is well-studied, its impact on inflammatory profile and migration capacity of leukemic cells are less understood. This study evaluates the effects of Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) on the inflammatory mechanisms influencing leukemic cell migration. Results show that C3G doses up to 50 µM do not affect cell metabolism, viability, or cell cycle phases. C3G significantly reduces TNF-α, IL-8, CCL2 production, and the p-NFκB/NFκB ratio in LPS (Lipopolysaccharide)-challenged cells. It also diminishes migration rates in response to LPS or fMLP (N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine) stimulation and reduces Rho-GTP expression. Thus, C3G modifies the inflammatory and migration properties of leukemic cells, highlighting the potential of anthocyanins as a complementary therapy and an avenue for further therapeutic intervention."

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a significant global health challenge, with approximately 1.8 million new cases diagnosed annually and a mortality toll exceeding 881,000 lives each year. This study aimed to evaluate the chemoprotective efficacy of Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) in a rat model of CRC induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH). Rats were stratified into groups and administered C3G at doses of 10 and 15 mg/kg following DMH exposure to initiate CRC. Key parameters, including organ weights, tumor burdens, and biochemical markers, were meticulously assessed. Administration of C3G significantly restored body weight while reducing the weights of colon and spleen tissues. Moreover, C3G treatment substantially suppressed tumor incidence and weight in DMH-induced CRC rats. Biochemical analysis revealed that C3G markedly reduced levels of CFA, CA19.9, LDH, and nitric oxide (NO). It also modulated lipid profiles, antioxidant activities, and the expression of both Phase I and II enzymes. Inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-1α, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-17, were significantly downregulated. Notably, C3G inhibited inflammatory markers such as COX-2, PGE2, iNOS, and NF-κB while promoting Caspase-3, -6, and -9 activity. Furthermore, it regulated the Bax/Bcl-2 apoptotic axis, reducing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. Cyanidin-3-glucoside demonstrated potent chemopreventive effects against colorectal cancer in this experimental model. Its mechanism of action is likely mediated through modulation of NF-κB and the Bcl-2/Bax/Caspase pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent in CRC management.",

Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), a recognized food antioxidant, has shown promise in protecting in male reproduction and modulating epigenetic modifications. However, its potential role in ameliorating intergenerational inheritance induced by HFHFD remains underexplored. In this study, we investigated the effects of paternal HFHFD on reproductive injury of offspring and the protective effect of C3G. Paternal mice were subjected to 12 weeks of HFHFD induction and C3G treatment was conducted for 8 weeks. Offspring obtained via in vitro fertilization were fed either a normal diet (ND) or high-fat diet (HFD). Our findings indicate that while the paternal HFHFD did not result in observable reproductive impairments in paternal mice, it did affect offspring testicular function through intergenerational inheritance, rendering them more susceptible to testicular damage and reduced sperm counts when exposed to an HFD. Notably, C3G intervention significantly mitigated these effects, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic compound for alleviating the impact of paternal intergenerational inheritance on male fertility resulting from HFHFD. These results underscore the importance of further exploring the mechanisms underlying intergenerational inheritance and the potential of interventions such as C3G in mitigating its effects, with implications for both basic research and clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Inhibition of human concentrative nucleoside transporter 2 (CNT2) could suppress increases in serum urate levels derived from dietary purines. However, the structural basis for substrate recognition of CNT2 is still unknown and only a few inhibitors have been reported. In this study, a homology model of CNT2 was constructed and residues T315, E316, N426, N491, E492, F536 and N538 were identified as binding sites for adenosine through site-directed mutagenesis and a 3H-adenosine uptake assay. To explore potential CNT2 inhibitors, a database containing 4704 saccharides and glycosides was constructed, followed by high-throughput virtual screening. The top 20 compounds with the highest docking scores were then evaluated their in vitro activity. Among them, cyanidin-3-O-galactoside (Cy3Gal) demonstrated the most potent inhibitory activity against CNT2, exhibiting an IC50 value of 9.40 μM. Docking analysis revealed that residues M314, T315, T347, N422, F536 and S541 contributed to a strong binding affinity with Cy3Gal. In addition, Cy3Gal exhibited minimal inhibitory effects on CNT3 and equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) in vitro. At doses of 5-20 mg/kg, Cy3Gal effectively reduced serum and urine levels of uric acid and adenosine in vivo. The CCK-8 assay revealed that Cy3Gal displayed minimal cytotoxicity to mTEC and hIEC cells at a concentration of 100 μM. The serum CR and BUN levels indicate that Cy3Gal does not exhibit any apparent renal toxicity compared to lesinurad and allopurinol. HE examination showed no noticeable pathological changes in the kidneys or colons after treatment with Cy3Gal. In summary, Cy3Gal could be a CNT2 inhibitor with favorable drugability for the treatment of hyperuricemia.",

This study aimed to demonstrate the role and mechanism of C3G in regulating 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR)-mediated cholesterol anabolism on H2O2-induced oxidative stress in HEK-293T cells. Firstly, the inhibitory effect of C3G on oxidative stress was confirmed by CCK-8, ROS, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) experiments. Then, proteomics was used to investigate and screen differentially expressed proteins in inhibiting cellular oxidative stress by C3G. HMGCR was screened as a key differentially expressed protein by proteomic analysis. The results verified that C3G could reduce cholesterol levels by inhibiting sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP2)/HMGCR pathway, increasing ATP, and reducing acetyl-CoA. Finally, HMGCR had been shown to positively increase ROS accumulation and decrease MMP, which were reversed by intervention of C3G through a series of knockdown and overexpression experiments. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that C3G could inhibit the disorder of cholesterol synthesis in oxidative stress cells by regulating the ROS/SREBP2/HMGCR pathway."

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis is a public health issue with a rising worldwide incidence. It has been found that current medications for treating UC may cause varying degrees of damage to male fertility. Our previous study demonstrated that cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) treatment could effectively restore reproductive damage in a mouse model of DSS induced colitis. However, the underlying mechanism of C3G alleviates UC induced male reproductive disorders remain scarce. The aim of this study is to discover the molecular mechanisms of C3G on the amelioration of UC stimulated reproductive disorders. The targeted genes toward UC-induced reproductive injury upon C3G treatments were explored by transcriptomic analysis. Hematological analysis, histopathological examination, and real time transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis were applied for conjoined identification. Results showed that C3G may effectively target for reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in testis through cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. Transcriptome sequencing found that a series of genetic pathways involved in the protective effects of C3G on male reproduction were identified by gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Further results presented that C3G could effectively restore mRNA expression levels of Ly6a and Col1a1, closely linked with UC induced male reproductive damage pathways. Sufficient results implied that Ly6a and Col1a1 may be treated as the promising therapeutic targets for the mechanism of C3G in treating UC induced reproductive impairment. C3G administration might be an effective dietary supplementation strategy for male reproduction improvement.",

The results showed that C3G significantly decreased wet to dry weight (W/D) ratio of uterine, improved uterine pathological injury, and inhibited MPO activity. Further mechanism investigation showed that the activation of NFκB pathway and the levels of TNF-a, IL-1β, and IL-6 were significantly suppressed after C3G treatment. Conversely, C3G promoted LPS-induced the activation of the PPARγ/ABCA1 pathway. Interestingly, the anti-inflammatory effect of C3G was significantly weakened by GW9662, a PPARγ inhibitor. In addition, the anti-oxidative stress effect of C3G was also found. For the first time, our results showed that treatment with C3G might be a new strategy for treating endometritis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a leading cause of liver disease-related deaths worldwide. Unfortunately, approved medications for the treatment of this condition are quite limited. One promising candidate is the anthocyanin, Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), which has been reported to protect mice against hepatic lipid accumulation, as well as fibrosis in different animal models. However, the specific effects and mechanisms of C3G on ALD remain to be investigated. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In this report, a Gao-binge mouse model of ALD was used to investigate the effects of C3G on ethanol-induced liver injury. The mechanisms of these C3G effects were assessed using AML12 hepatocytes. RESULTS: C3G administration ameliorated ethanol-induced liver injury by suppressing hepatic oxidative stress, as well as through reducing hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation. Mechanistically, C3G activated the AMPK pathway and enhanced mitophagy to eliminate damaged mitochondria, thus reducing mitochondria-derived reactive oxidative species in ethanol-challenged hepatocytes. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that mitophagy plays a potentially important role underlying the hepatoprotective action of C3G, as demonstrated in a Gao-binge mouse model of ALD. Accordingly, C3G may serve as a promising, new therapeutic drug candidate for use in ALD.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Research has unveiled the neurotoxicity of Bisphenol A (BPA) linked to neuropathological traits of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through varied mechanisms. This study aims to investigate the neuroprotective properties of cyanidin, an anthocyanin, in an in vivo model of BPA-induced Alzheimer's-like neuropathology. METHODS: Three-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups: vehicle control, negative control (BPA exposure), low-dose cyanidin treatment (BPA + cyanidin 5 mg/kg), and high-dose cyanidin treatment (BPA + cyanidin 10 mg/kg). Spatial memory was assessed through behavioral tests, including the Y-maze, novel object recognition, and Morris water maze. After behavioral tests, animals were euthanized, and brain regions were examined for acetylcholinesterase inhibition, p-tau, Wnt3, GSK3β, and β-catenin levels, antioxidant activities, and histopathological changes. RESULTS: BPA-exposed groups displayed memory impairments, while cyanidin-treated groups showed significant memory improvement (p < 0.0001). Cyanidin down regulated p-tau and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) and restored Wnt3 and β-catenin levels (p < 0.0001). Moreover, cyanidin exhibited antioxidant properties, elevating catalase and superoxide dismutase levels. The intervention significantly reduced the concentrations of acetylcholinesterase in the cortex and hippocampus in comparison to the groups treated with BPA (p < 0.0001). Significant gender-based disparities were not observed. CONCLUSION: Cyanidin demonstrated potent neuroprotection against BPA-induced Alzheimer's-like neuropathology by enhancing antioxidant defenses, modulating tau phosphorylation by restoring the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and ameliorating spatial memory deficits. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of cyanidin in countering neurotoxicity linked to BPA exposure.",

      "abstract": "Microplastics derived from plastic waste have emerged as a pervasive environmental pollutant with potential transfer and accumulation through the food chain, thus posing risks to both ecosystems and human health. The gut microbiota, tightly intertwined with metabolic processes, exert substantial influences on host physiology by utilizing dietary compounds and generating bacterial metabolites such as tryptophan and bile acid. Our previous studies have demonstrated that exposure to microplastic polystyrene (PS) disrupts the gut microbiota and induces colonic inflammation. Meanwhile, intervention with cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), a natural anthocyanin derived from red bayberry, could mitigate colonic inflammation by reshaping the gut bacterial composition. Despite these findings, the specific influence of gut bacteria and their metabolites on alleviating colonic inflammation through C3G intervention remains incompletely elucidated. Therefore, employing a C57BL/6 mouse model, this study aims to investigate the mechanisms underlying how C3G modulates gut bacteria and their metabolites to alleviate colonic inflammation. Notably, our findings demonstrated the efficacy of C3G in reversing the elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α) and the upregulation of mRNA expression (Il-6, Il-1β, and Tnf-α) induced by PS exposure. Meanwhile, C3G effectively inhibited the reduction in levels (IL-22, IL-10, and IL-4) and the downregulation of mRNA expression (Il-22, Il-10, and Il-4) of anti-inflammatory cytokines induced by PS exposure. Moreover, PS-induced phosphorylation of the transcription factor NF-κB in the nucleus, as well as the increased level of protein expression of iNOS and COX-2 in the colon, were inhibited by C3G. Metabolisms of gut bacterial tryptophan and bile acids have been extensively implicated in the regulation of inflammatory processes. The 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing disclosed that PS treatment significantly increased the abundance of pro-inflammatory bacteria (Desulfovibrio, norank_f_Oscillospiraceae, Helicobacter, and Lachnoclostridium) while decreasing the abundance of anti-inflammatory bacteria (Dubosiella, Akkermansia, and Alistipes). Intriguingly, C3G intervention reversed these pro-inflammatory changes in bacterial abundances and augmented the enrichment of bacterial genes involved in tryptophan and bile acid metabolism pathways. Furthermore, untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed the notable upregulation of metabolites associated with tryptophan metabolism (shikimate, l-tryptophan, indole-3-lactic acid, and N-acetylserotonin) and bile acid metabolism (3b-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid, chenodeoxycholate, taurine, and lithocholic acid) following C3G administration. Collectively, these findings shed new light on the protective effects of dietary C3G against PS exposure and underscore the involvement of specific gut bacterial metabolites in the amelioration of colonic inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic testicular damage is quite a common and significant complication in diabetic men, which could result in infertility. The natural fertility rate of type 1 diabetes men is only 50% because of testicular damage. This research first aimed to explore the intervention effect of C3G on testicular tissue damage induced by diabetes. Here, a streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic rat model was established, and then C3G was administered. After 8 weeks of C3G supplementation, the symptoms of diabetes (e.g., high blood glucose, lower body weight, polydipsia, polyphagia) were relieved, and at the same time that sperm motility and viability increased, sperm abnormality decreased in C3G-treated diabetic rats. Furthermore, the pathological structure of testis was restored; the fibrosis of the testicular interstitial tissue was inhibited; and the LH, FSH, and testosterone levels were all increased in the C3G-treated groups. Testicular oxidative stress was relieved; serum and testicular inflammatory cytokines levels were significantly decreased in C3G-treated groups; levels of Bax, Caspase-3, TGF-β1 and Smad2/3 protein in testis decreased; and the level of Bcl-2 was up-regulated in the C3G-treated groups. A possible mechanism might be that C3G improved antioxidant capacity, relieved oxidative stress, increased anti-inflammatory cytokine expression, and inhibited the apoptosis of spermatogenic cells and testicular fibrosis, thus promoting the production of testosterone and repair of testicular function. In conclusion, this study is the first to reveal that testicular damage could be mitigated by C3G in type 1 diabetic rats. Our results provide a theoretical basis for the application of C3G in male reproductive injury caused by diabetes."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anthocyanins are a group of natural products widely found in plants. They have been found to alleviate the disorders of glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: HepG2 and L02 cells were incubated with 0.2 mM PA and 30 mM glucose for 24 h to induce IR, and cells treated with 5 mM glucose were used as the control. C57BL/6 J male mice and db/db male mice were fed with a chow diet and gavaged with pure water or cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) solution (150 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks. RESULTS: In this study, the anthocyanin C3G, extracted from red bayberry, was found to alleviate disorders of glucose metabolism, which resulted in increased insulin sensitivity in hepatocytes, and achieved by enhancing the glucose consumption as well as glycogen synthesis in insulin resistance (IR) hepatpcytes. Subsequently, the expression of key proteins involved in IR was detected by western blotting analysis. Protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B), a negative regulator of insulin signaling, could reduce cellular sensitivity to insulin by inhibiting the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2). Results of this study showed that C3G inhibited the increase in PTP1B after high glucose and palmitic acid treatment. And this inhibition was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of IRS proteins. Furthermore, the effect of C3G on improving IR in vivo was validated by using a diabetic db/db mouse model. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that C3G could alleviate IR in vitro and in vivo to increase insulin sensitivity, which may offer a new insight for regulating glucose metabolism during T2DM by using the natural dietary bioactive components. C3G promotes the phosphorylation of IRS-2 proteins by suppressing the expression of PTP1B, and then enhances the sensitivity of hepatocyte to insulin.",

      "abstract": "In the current study the effects of metformin and cyanidin on the immune system and intestinal flora in rats with type-2 diabetes was investigated. The findings showed that metformin or cyanidin treatment considerably reduced the rise in body weight and glucose levels induced by type-2 diabetes. The type-2 diabetic rats' glucose tolerance was significantly increased by cyanidin administration comparable to that of metformin. Cyanidin administration resulted in a significant reduction in serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in rats with type-2 diabetes. Treatment with cyanidin significantly increased the ratio of high-density lipoprotein to low-density lipoprotein in type-2 diabetes rats. Cyanidin administration significantly raised the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes in the fecal samples of type-2 diabetic rats compared to the model group. In comparison to the model group, it also significantly raised the levels of Lactobacillus intestinalis, Lactobacillus gasseri, and Lactobacillus reuteri in the type-2 diabetes rats. In type-2 diabetes rat fecal samples, the abundance of Christensenellaceae significantly increased while Enterobacteriaceae and Proteobacteria were found to decrease upon cyanidin administration. Furthermore, cyanidin administration to the rats with type-2 diabetes significantly improved the glucose homeostasis. In conclusion, the study demonstrates that cyanidin enhances glucose homeostasis in rats with type-2 diabetes, potentially through controlling intestinal flora. Thus, cyanidin may be looked into more as a possible therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Myocardial infarction is a worldwide disease with high morbidity and mortality and a major cause of chronic heart failure, seriously affecting patients' quality of life. Natural medicine has been used to cure or prevent cardiovascular disease for decades. As a natural flavonoid, anthocyanidin has been used to treat many diseases due to its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and other properties. A mouse model (C57BL/6) weighing 30-40 g was utilized to induce myocardial infarction by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. Cyanidin (30 mg/kg) was administered orally to mice for four weeks. A variety of assessments were used to evaluate cardiac function. The gene expression was measured using RNAseq and Western blot. Histological changes in myocardial tissue were assessed using staining techniques, including Masson, Hematoxylin Eosin (HE), and transmission electron microscopy. Tunnel staining was implemented as a method to detect cellular apoptosis. For the quantification of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in the serum, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed. Furthermore, autodock simulation was executed in order to assess the interaction between cyanidin and a subset of genes. Cyanidin treatment inhibited myocardial cell apoptosis, improved cardiac function, and reduced serum concentrations of BNP and atrial natriuretic peptide ANP, as well as mitigated histological cardiac tissue damage. Cyanidin also inhibited the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2/9) and Fibronectin 1 (Fn1). Cyanidin improves heart function and reduces myocardial damage in mice after MI. Furthermore, cyanidin can prevent cardiomyocyte apoptosis. These effects are most likely caused by suppression of MMP9/2 and control of the Akt signaling pathway, suggesting an appropriate therapeutic target.",

      "abstract": "Muscular dystrophies (MDs) are incurable genetic myopathies characterized by progressive degeneration of skeletal muscles. Dystrophic mice lacking the transcription factor Nfix display morphological and functional improvements of the disease. Recently, we demonstrated that MAPK signaling pathway positively regulates Nfix in muscle development and that Cyanidin, a natural antioxidant molecule, strongly ameliorates the pathology. To explore a synergistic approach aimed at treating MDs, we administered Trametinib, a clinically approved MEK inhibitor, alone or combined with Cyanidin to adult Sgca null mice. We observed that chronic treatment with Trametinib and Cyanidin reduced Nfix in myogenic cells but, unexpectedly, caused ectopic calcifications exclusively in dystrophic muscles. The combined treatment with Cyanidin resulted in histological improvements by preventing Trametinib-induced calcifications in Diaphragm and Soleus. Collectively, this first pilot study revealed that Nfix is modulated by the MAPK pathway in MDs, and that Cyanidin partly rescued the unexpected ectopic calcifications caused by MEK inhibition."

This study employed an experimental design combining in vitro and in vivo approaches to explore the effects of Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) and Carboxypyranocyanidin-3-O-glucoside (Vitisin A) on AGA. In human dermal papilla cells (HDPCs), both anthocyanins demonstrated inhibitory effects on androgen receptors, significantly reduced dihydrotestosterone (DHT) induced apoptosis of HDPCs, and regulated the secretion of Fibroblast growth factor 7 and Transforming growth factor beta 1. In vitro transdermal experiment revealed that both C3G and Vitisin A could penetrate mice skin, aided by the application of cream. Furthermore, in vivo experiments with mice indicated that application of C3G or Vitisin A cream effectively improved hair follicles miniaturization, regression, and apoptosis caused by DHT. The repression of Wnt10b and β-catenin expression induced by DHT was prevented by C3G and Vitisin A in both cell and mouse model. Consequently, these findings suggest that C3G and Vitisin A could be considered as alternative methods for alleviating AGA.",

      "abstract": "Obesity has become a major health issue worldwide and obese individuals possess higher levels of adipose tissue when compared with healthy individuals. Obesity is highly associated with the development of different chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, cancers, etc. Previous studies established that anthocyanin compounds play an important role in attenuating obesity-related consequences. Among various anthocyanin compounds, cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside (C3G) is the most important component and is widely distributed in various colored edible plant materials, especially berries, cherries, black rice, purple corn, etc. In recent decades, several studies have reported the therapeutical properties of C3G. C3G has various biological properties and health benefits, such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anti-obesity, neuroprotective, anticancer, etc. In this review, we summarized the in vitro and in vivo studies in relation to the role of C3G in obesity-related complications. Several mechanistic studies demonstrated that C3G maintains the metabolism of glucose, fatty acids, and lipids by regulating different genes and signaling pathways. It could be concluded that the consumption of C3G protects healthy individuals from obesity-related issues by maintaining body weight and regulating their metabolism and energy balance. This review provides some important signaling pathways/targets of C3G to facilitate the prevention and treatment of obesity, leading to the development of important food supplements."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in the biological and biochemical processes of cells, and it is a critical process in the malignant transformation, and mobility of cancer. Additionally, EMT is one of the main mechanisms contributing to chemoresistance. Resistance to oxaliplatin (OXA) poses a momentous challenge in the chemotherapy of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, highlighting the need to reverse drug resistance and improve patient survival. In this study, we explored the response of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), the most abundant anthocyanin in plants, on the mechanisms of drug resistance in cancer, with the purpose of overcoming acquired OXA resistance in CRC cell lines. METHODS: We generated an acquired OXA-resistant cell line, named HCT-116-ROx, by gradually exposing parental HCT-116 cells to increasing concentrations of OXA. To characterize the resistance, we performed cytotoxicity assays and shape factor analyses. The apoptotic rate of both resistant and parental cells was determined using Hoechst 33342/Propidium Iodide (PI) fluorescence staining. Migration capacity was evaluated using a wound-healing assay. The mesenchymal phenotype was assessed through qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining, employing E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin markers. RESULTS: Resistance characterization announced decreased OXA sensitivity in resistant cells compared to parental cells. Moreover, the resistant cells exhibited a spindle cell morphology, indicative of the mesenchymal phenotype. Combined treatment of C3G and OXA resulted in an augmented apoptotic rate in the resistant cells. The migration capacity of resistant cells was higher than parental cells, while treatment with C3G decreased the migration rate of HCT-116-ROx cells. Analysis of EMT markers showed that HCT-116-ROx cells exhibited loss of the epithelial phenotype (E-cadherin) and gain of the mesenchymal phenotype (N-cadherin and Vimentin) compared to HCT-116 cells. However, treatment of resistant cells with C3G reversed the mesenchymal phenotype. CONCLUSION: The morphological observations of cells acquiring oxaliplatin resistance indicated the loss of the epithelial phenotype and the acquisition of the mesenchymal phenotype. These findings suggest that EMT may contribute to acquired OXA resistance in CRC. Furthermore, C3G decreased the mobility of resistant cells, and reversed the EMT process, indicating its potential to overcome acquired OXA resistance.",

However, as the effects of C3G on the amyloidogenic pathway, autophagy, tau phosphorylation, neuronal cell death, and synaptic plasticity in Alzheimer's disease models have not been reported, we attempted to investigate the same in the brains of APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice were analyzed. After oral administration of C3G (30 mg/kg/day) for 16 weeks, the cortical and hippocampal regions in the brains of APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice were analyzed. C3G treatment reduced the levels of soluble and insoluble Aβ (Aβ40 and Aβ42) peptides and reduced the protein expression of the amyloid precursor protein, presenilin-1, and β-secretase in the cortical and hippocampal regions. And C3G treatment upregulated the expression of autophagy-related markers, LC3B-II, LAMP-1, TFEB, and PPAR-α and downregulated that of SQSTM1/p62, improving the autophagy of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In addition, C3G increased the protein expression of phosphorylated-AMPK/AMPK and Sirtuin 1 and decreased that of mitogen-activated protein kinases, such as phosphorylated-Akt/Akt and phosphorylated-ERK/ERK, thus demonstrating its neuroprotective effects. Furthermore, C3G regulated the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling by upregulating phosphorylated-Akt/Akt and phosphorylated-GSK3β/GSK3β expression. C3G administration mitigated tau phosphorylation and improved synaptic function and plasticity by upregulating the expression of synapse-associated proteins synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein-95. Although the potential of C3G in the APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mouse models has not yet been reported, oral administration of the C3G is shown to protect the brain and improve cognitive behavior.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder causing memory loss and cognitive decline, linked to amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau protein accumulation in the brain. Environmental pollutant bisphenol A (BPA) has been implicated in AD pathology due to its neurotoxic effects. This study aims to evaluate cyanidin from flower bracts of Musa acuminata Colla (red variety; AAA group) for its neuroprotective properties against BPA-induced AD pathology. The extraction of cyanidin was optimized using 70% ethanol in acidified water, showing promising anti-acetylcholinesterase activity. Cyanidin was effectively purified from the resultant extract and characterized using spectroscopic techniques. Two gradient doses of cyanidin (90 and 10 µg/ml) were determined based on cell viability assay. The role of cyanidin in promoting nerve growth and differentiation was assessed in PC12 cells for up to 72 h. A discernible and statistically significant difference was assessed in neurite extension at both doses at 72 h, followed by pre-treatment with cyanidin. BPA stimulation significantly increased the p-tau expression compared to the control (p < 0.0001). Pre-treatment with cyanidin reduced the tau expression; however, a significant difference was observed compared to control cells (p = 0.0003). Cyanidin significantly enhanced the mRNA expression of Wnt3a (p < 0.0001), β-catenin (p = 0.0004), and NeuroD1 (p = 0.0289), and decreased the expression of WIF1(p = 0.0040) and DKK1 (p < 0.0001), which are Wnt antagonist when compared to cells stimulated with BPA. Conclusively, our finding suggests that cyanidin could agonize nerve growth factor and promote neuronal differentiation, reduce tau-hyperphosphorylation by restoring the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade, and thereby render its neuroprotective potential against BPA-induced AD pathology.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of covalent and non-covalent interactions between myofibrillar protein (MP) and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) on protein structure, binding sites, and digestion properties. Four methods of inducing covalent cross-linking were used in the preparation of MP-C3G conjugates, including tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidation, alkaline pH shift treatment, free radical grafting, and ultrasonic treatment. A comparison was made between MP-C3G conjugates and complexes, and the analysis included sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), C3G binding ratio, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), protein side-chain amino acids, circular dichroism spectroscopy, three-dimensional fluorescence, particle size, and in vitro simulated digestion. RESULTS: Covalent bonding between C3G and amino acid side chains in MP was confirmed by LC-MS/MS. In covalent bonding, tryptophan residues, free amino groups and sulfhydryl groups were all implicated. Among the 22 peptides covalently modified by C3G, 30 modification sites were identified, located in lysine, histidine, tryptophan, arginine and cysteine. In vitro simulated digestion experiments showed that the addition of C3G significantly reduced the digestibility of MP, with the covalent conjugate showing lower digestibility than the non-covalent conjugate. Moreover, the digestibility of protein decreased more during intestinal digestion, possibly because covalent cross-linking of C3G and MP further inhibited trypsin targeting sites (lysine and arginine). CONCLUSION: Covalent cross-linking of C3G with myofibrillar proteins significantly affected protein structure and reduced protein digestibility by occupying more trypsin binding sites. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "The human ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein, Pgp) protein is an active exporter expressed in the plasma membrane of cells forming biological barriers. In accordance with its broad substrate spectrum and tissue expression pattern, it affects the pharmacokinetics of numerous chemotherapeutic drugs and it is involved in unwanted drug-drug interactions leading to side effects or toxicities. When expressed in tumor tissues, it contributes to the development of chemotherapy resistance in malignancies. Therefore, the understanding of the molecular details of the ligand-ABCB1 interactions is of crucial importance. In a previous study, we found that quercetin (QUR) hampers both the transport and ATPase activity of ABCB1, while cyandin-3O-sophroside (C3S) stimulates the ATPase activity and causes only a weak inhibition of substrate transport. In the current study, when QUR and C3S were applied together, both a stronger ATPase inhibition and a robust decrease in substrate transport were observed, supporting their synergistic ABCB1 inhibitory effect. Similar to cyclosporine A, a potent ABCB1 inhibitor, co-treatment with QUR and C3S shifted the conformational equilibrium to the \"inward-facing\" conformer of ABCB1, as it was detected by the conformation-selective UIC2 mAb. To gain deeper insight into the molecular details of ligand-ABCB1 interactions, molecular docking experiments and MD simulations were also carried out. Our in silico studies support that QUR and C3S can bind simultaneously to ABCB1. The most favourable ligand-ABCB1 interaction is obtained when C3S binds to the central substrate binding site and QUR occupies the \"access tunnel\". Our results also highlight that the strong ABCB1 inhibitory effect of the combined treatment with QUR and C3S may be exploited in chemotherapy protocols for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tumors or for improving drug delivery through pharmacological barriers.",

      "abstract": "Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), the most widely distributed anthocyanin (ACN) in edible fruits, has been proposed for several bioactivities, including anti-inflammatory, neuro-protective, antimicrobial, anti-viral, anti-thrombotic and epigenetic actions. However, habitual intake of ACNs and C3G may vary widely among populations, regions, and seasons, among individuals with different education and financial status. The main point of C3G absorption occurs in the small and large bowel. Therefore, it has been supposed that the treating properties of C3G might affect inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). IBDs develop through complex inflammatory pathways and sometimes may be resistant to conventional treatment strategies. C3G presents antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective, and antimicrobial effects useful for IBD management. In particular, different studies have demonstrated that C3G inhibits NF-κB pathway activation. In addition, C3G activates the Nrf2 pathway. On the other hand, it modulates the expression of antioxidant enzymes and cytoprotective proteins, such as NAD(P)H, superoxide dismutase, heme-oxygenase (HO-1), thioredoxin, quinone reductase-oxide 1 (NQO1), catalase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase. Interferon I and II pathways are downregulated by C3G inhibiting interferon-mediating inflammatory cascades. Moreover, C3G reduces reactive species and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as C reactive protein, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-5, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p70, and IL-17A in UC and CD patients. Finally, C3G modulates gut microbiota by inducing an increase in beneficial gut bacteria and increasing microbial abundances, thus mitigating dysbiosis. Thus, C3G presents activities that may have potential therapeutic and protective actions against IBD. Still, in the future, clinical trials should be designed to investigate the bioavailability of C3G in IBD patients and the proper therapeutic doses through different sources, aiming to the standardization of the exact clinical outcome and efficacy of C3G.",

METHODS: Mouse models were established by clamping the left renal vessels, and in vitro cellular models were established by hypoxic reoxygenation. RESULTS: Renal dysfunction and tissue structural damage were significantly higher in the I/R group. After treatment with different concentrations of C3G, the levels of renal dysfunction and tissue structural damage decreased at different levels. And its protective effect was most pronounced at 200 mg/kg. The use of C3G reduced apoptosis as well as the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related proteins. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced apoptosis and ERS are dependent on oxidative stress in vitro. In addition, both AG490 and C3G inhibited the activation of JAK/STAT pathway and attenuated oxidative stress, ischemia-induced apoptosis and ERS. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that C3G blocked renal apoptosis and ERS protein expression by preventing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production after I/R via the JAK/STAT pathway, suggesting that C3G may be a potential therapeutic agent for renal I/R injury.",

      "abstract": "Bisphenol A (BPA) has attracted growing attention as a well-known environmental pollutant due to its high risk of male reproductive toxicity. In this study, transcriptomics profiling combined with metabolomic techniques was applied to explore the intervention effects of BPA-induced male reproductive toxicity. We demonstrated that cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) and its main metabolite protocatechuic acid (PCA) significantly increased testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels in the serum of rats, and improved sperm quality. Furthermore, we identified and screened differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and metabolites (DMs) that functionally enriched in the steroidogenesis-related pathways. Next, the validated results found that C3G and PCA significantly up-regulated the gene expressions of Star, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, Cyp19a1, Cyp7a1, Hsd3b1, Hsd3b2, Hsd17b3, Scrab1, and Ass1 in testicular. In Leydig cells, C3G and PCA dramatically alleviated apoptosis, ROS accumulation, and cell cycle arrest caused by BPA. In addition, molecular docking and simulation results implied that C3G and PCA competitively with BPA bind to the estrogen receptors α and β (ERα and ERβ) and shared common key amino acids. The main interaction modes between small molecules and estrogen receptors included π-π stacking, salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions. Therefore, our study sheds light on C3G and PCA supplementation can protect male reproduction from BPA-induced injury.",

      "abstract": "Cyanidin is the most abundant anthocyanin found in red-purple plants and possesses anti-obesity properties. However, its mechanism of action in adipocytes remains unknown. The objective of this study was to elucidate how cyanidin inhibits adipocyte formation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Cells were cultured in adipogenic differentiation medium supplemented with cyanidin and examined for adipogenesis, cell viability, and adipocyte gene expression using Oil Red O staining, MTT assay, and RT-qPCR. Real-time Ca2+ imaging analysis was performed in living cells to elucidate cyanidin's mechanism of action. The results demonstrated that cyanidin (1-50 μM) supplementation to the adipogenic medium inhibited adipogenesis by downregulating adipogenic marker gene expression (PPARγ, C/EBPα, adiponectin, and aP2) without affecting cell viability after 4 days of treatment. Stimulation of cells with cyanidin (30-100 μM) increased intracellular Ca2+ in a concentration dependent manner with peak calcium increases at 50 μM. Pretreatment of cells with the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122, inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptor blocker 2-APB, and depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores by thapsigargin abolished the Ca2+ increases by cyanidin. These findings suggested that cyanidin inhibits adipocyte formation by activating the PLC-IP3 pathway and intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Our study is the first report describing the mechanism underlying the anti-obesity effect of cyanidin.",

Intervention trials and subsequent meta-analyses have suggested that anthocyanins could reduce the risks of cardiovascular diseases. This study investigated hemodynamic alterations following a single intragastric dose of C3G by measuring blood flow in rat cremaster muscle arteriole for 60 min. Next, in excised aortas, we performed western blotting to measure the phosphorylation of Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). A single oral dose of C3G significantly increased blood flow soon after ingestion, and it was maintained throughout the experimental period. In addition, aortic Akt phosphorylation increased. Then, we examined the impact of repeated oral administrations of C3G for 14 days. The mean blood pressure was significantly reduced at 7 and 14 days after treatment, with a slight increase in aortic eNOS expression. Immunohistochemical analyses of the soleus showed that the level of CD31, an angiogenesis-marker protein, was significantly increased with C3G. These results suggested that an oral dose of C3G increased blood flow, which promoted angiogenesis within skeletal muscle, and consequently, blood pressure was reduced."

      "abstract": "Psychostimulant exposure and withdrawal cause neuroimmune dysregulation and anxiety that contributes to dependence and relapse. Here, we tested the hypothesis that withdrawal from the synthetic cathinone MDPV (methylenedioxypyrovalerone) produces anxiety-like effects and enhanced levels of mesocorticolimbic cytokines that are inhibited by cyanidin, an anti-inflammatory flavonoid and nonselective blocker of IL-17A signaling. For comparison, we tested effects on glutamate transporter systems that are also dysregulated during psychostimulant free period. Rats injected for 9 d with MDPV (1 mg/kg, IP) or saline were pretreated daily with cyanidin (0.5 mg/kg, IP) or saline, followed by behavioral testing on the elevated zero maze (EZM) 72 h after the last MDPV injection. MDPV withdrawal caused a reduction in time spent on the open arm of the EZM that was prevented by cyanidin. Cyanidin itself did not affect locomotor activity or time spent on the open arm, or cause aversive or rewarding effects in place preference experiments. MDPV withdrawal caused enhancement of cytokine levels (IL-17A, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF=α, IL-10, and CCL2) in the ventral tegmental area, but not amygdala, nucleus accumbens, or prefrontal cortex, that was prevented by cyanidin. During MDPV withdrawal, mRNA levels of glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) and glutamate transporter subtype 1 (GLT-1) in the amygdala were also elevated but normalized by cyanidin treatment. These results show that MDPV withdrawal induced anxiety, and brain-region specific dysregulation of cytokine and glutamate systems, that are both prevented by cyanidin, thus identifying cyanidin for further investigation in the context of psychostimulant dependence and relapse.",

C3G was investigated for its effect on human gastric cancer (GC) cells, together with its molecular mechanism. The CCK-8 assay results showed that C3G had significant antiproliferative effects on GC cells, but it had little effect on normal cells. Western blot and flow cytometry results showed that C3G regulated the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential and arrested the cell cycle in the G2/M phase through the AKT signaling pathway, causing the cells to undergo apoptosis. Additionally, in MKN-45 cells, C3G markedly raised intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The wound healing assay and Transwell assay results showed that MKN-45 cell migration was significantly inhibited. Western blot results showed that the expression of E-cadherin protein was upregulated and the expressions of β-catenin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin were downregulated. Additionally, following N-acetylcysteine treatment, the expression levels of these proteins were reduced. In conclusion, C3G caused MKN-45 cells to undergo apoptosis; arrested the cell cycle in the G2/M phase; hindered cell migration; and activated the MAPK, STAT3, and NF-κB signaling pathways, by inducing an increase in ROS levels. Thus, C3G may be a promising new medication for the treatment of GC.",

However, the effect of Rosa gallica on skin hydration and its active components are largely unknown. Herein, we aimed to investigate the skin hydration effect of rose petal extract (RPE) in humans and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. A double-blinded clinical study was performed to investigate the effect of RPE on skin hydration. Stratum corneum moisture analysis demonstrated that RPE treatment significantly improved hydration levels in human skin. Furthermore, HAS2 and hyaluronic acid levels were notably increased by RPE in keratinocytes and 3D human skin equivalent model. By comparing the modulatory effect on HAS2 expression, cyanidin-3,5-O-diglucoside (CDG) was identified as the most potent compound in RPE likely responsible for skin hydration. The kinase activity of GLK, an upstream regulator of MAPK signaling, was increased by CDG in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, silencing GLK reversed CDG-mediated HAS2 upregulation, further supporting the involvement of GLK in the CDG-mediated effects. Binding of CDG to GLK was confirmed by pull-down assay and computer modeling. These findings suggest that RPE and its active component CDG increases skin hydration by upregulating HAS2 expression through modulating the GLK-MAP2K-MAPK signaling pathway.",

In this study, we evaluated the hepatoprotective ability of cyanidin (Cy) and investigated its associated mechanisms. Cy administration significantly and dose-dependently ameliorated acute liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). High-dose Cy showed effects comparable to those achieved by the positive control (silymarin). Severe oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in the liver tissue induced by CCl4 were significantly mitigated by Cy supplementation. The total antioxidant capacity and the activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase were increased and the content of malondialdehyde, lipid peroxide, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 were decreased. Additionally, the Nrf2 and NF-κB signaling pathways, which regulate antioxidative and inflammatory responses, were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot assay. Cy treatment not only increased Nrf2 transcription and expression but also decreased NF-κB signaling. Moreover, molecular docking simulation indicated that Cy had high affinity for Keap1 and NF-κB/p65, which may promote nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and inhibit that of NF-κB. In summary, Cy treatment exerted antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects and ameliorated liver injury by increasing Nrf2 and inhibiting the NF-κB pathway, demonstrating the potential of Cy as a therapeutic agent in liver injury."

In this study, we tested the antioxidants cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) and verbascoside (Verb) in the protection of retinal endothelium against glucose toxicity \"in vitro\". METHODS: Increasing amounts (5-50 μM) of C3G, Verb or the combination of both compounds were tested in Human Retinal Endothelial Cells (HREC) grown with normal glucose (5 mM, NG) or high glucose (25 mM, HG). RESULTS: Reduced cell viability and enhanced ROS levels (evaluated by MTT and H2DCFDA assays, respectively) in HG-stimulated HREC were restored by C3G and Verb in a dose-dependent manner, achieving the maximum protection in the presence of both compounds. Moreover, co-treatment with C3G and Verb worked better than each single molecule alone in the prevention of the disruption of blood-retinal-barrier-like properties by HG in a confluent HREC monolayer, as assessed by trans endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and Na-Fluorescein permeability assays. Accordingly, C3G and Verb together also better counteracted the HG-induced down-regulation of the tight junction membrane proteins Zonula Occludens-1 and VE-Cadherin evaluated by immunocytochemical and Western blot analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our data indicate that C3G and Verb could efficiently protect the retinal endothelium against high glucose damage.",

METHODS: Using seven GSC lines, the anti-tumor effect of cyanidin is tested. The effect of cyanidin on the cell viability in each cell line is evaluated. Wnt signaling pathway-related genes are checked after treatment of cyanidin. Cytoplasmic/nuclear β-catenin protein levels post cyanidin treatment is detected. Protein levels of c-Myc after cyanidin treatment are determined. Twist1 and Snail1 protein levels after cyanidin treatment are checked as well. RESULTS: Cyanidin significantly reduces the cell viability of all GSCs, and exhibited the most substantial effect in GBM2 but no apparent effect in 293T cells. It can regulate the Wnt signaling pathway of all GSC lines. In the GBM2, GBM7, G166, and G179 cell lines, there is upregulation of WNT1 and MYC genes, while in the G144 and GliNS2 cell line, these two genes are down-regulated after cyanidin treatment. Cytoplasmic and nuclear protein levels of β-catenin in all cell lines are down-regulated. Cyanidin treatment significantly decreases the protein level for c-Myc in the GBM2 cell line compared with untreated cells, not in G144 or GliNS2 cells. Furthermore, cyanidin strongly reduces the expression of Twist1 and Snail1 in GBM2, G179, and G144 cell lines, while the GliNS2 cells show an opposite change in the cytoplasm and no change in nuclear. CONCLUSION: Cyanidin exerts an anti-tumor effect in glioma stem cell lines, probably through the Wnt signaling pathway.",

The article provides an insight into the potential of using a single phytochemical, cyanidin to treat various cancer types including breast, liver, lung, prostate, and thyroid cancer. Information about cyanidin and its pharmacological impact on cancer was collected from books, scientific journals, and reports through electronic data search (Web of Science, Scifinder, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Elsevier, Springer, Wiley, ACS, Science Direct, CNKI as well as Kew Plants of the Word Online) and library. Cyanidin produces its effects against cancer probably by inhibiting (RAS, MAPK) and activating (caspases-3 and P-38) innovative molecular pathways. It may cause cell cycle arrest, cell differentiation processes and changes in redox status which trigger the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic effects. However, it also optimizes the chemotherapeutic targets which are cancer cells less responsive to chemotherapy. Cancer is considered the most widely spread disease and cyanidin from natural origin provides an essential role in treatment of cancer by approaching various mechanistic pathways.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a global disease that places a significant burden on human health. Neuroinflammation and disturbance of glutamate metabolism in brain regions, such as the hippocampus, play vital roles in the development of depression. Previous studies have shown that cyanidin chloride (Cycl) has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties with neuroprotective effects in peripheral tissues. However, the effects of Cycl on depression and the possible mechanism by which this compound targets brain regions remain less elucidated. We investigated the role of Cycl in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression and examined the influence of the drug on central inflammation and the expression of excitatory amino acid transporters in the hippocampus. We found that prophylactic i.p. application of Cycl at 20 or 40 mg/kg for 5 days significantly reduced the immobility time assessed by the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swim test (FST) in LPS-challenged mice, suggesting an effective antidepressant activity of the drug. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining in the hippocampus revealed that Cycl inhibited the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-6, and suppressed the hyperactivity of microglia induced by LPS, indicating an anti-inflammatory role in the hippocampus. Moreover, treatment with Cycl also recovered the downregulated expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST) and excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2), two members in the excitatory amino acid transporter family. The role of Cycl was also verified in cultured BV2 and U251 cells. In conclusion, the present in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate that Cycl exerts potent antidepressant action in an LPS-induced depression model and the underlying mechanism is associated with reduced hippocampal inflammation, improved neurotrophic function, and attenuated excitotoxicity induced by glutamate.",

      "abstract": "Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) is the most widely distributed anthocyanin and it can reportedly reduce the risk of osteoporosis, but the molecular mechanism by which C3G promotes bone formation is poorly understood. In the current study, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to investigate the mechanism of action of C3G in osteogenesis. MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts were divided into a C3G (100 μmol/L)-treated group and a vehicle-treated control group, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in groups were evaluated via RNA-seq analysis. The functions of the DEGs were evaluated by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses, and the genes were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. The RNA-seq analysis identified 34 genes that were upregulated in C3G-treated cells compared to vehicle-treated cells, and 17 that were downregulated GO and KEGG pathway analyses indicated that these genes were highly enriched in functions related to lysosomes and glycolipid biosynthesis, among others. The differential expression of ATPase H+-transporting V0 subunit C (Atp6v0c), chemokine (C-X3-C motif) ligand 1 (Cx3cl1), and lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus A (Ly6a) genes was validated by quantitative real-time-PCR. Because these genes have been previously implicated in osteoporosis, they are potential target genes of C3G action in MC3T3-E1 cells. These results provide molecular level evidence for the therapeutic potential of C3G in the treatment of osteoporosis and other disorders of bone metabolism."

Nanoliposomes can inhibit C3G degradation and enhance the absorption rate of C3G as tools for conveying materials to particular locations. This experiment aims to study the absorption, transport and anti-inflammatory effects of C3G nanoliposomes in Caco-2/RAW 264.7 co-culture model, which symbolizes an intestinal inflammation system. The results indicated that the uptake and transport of C3G nanoliposomes by Caco-2/RAW 264.7 co-culture model were concentration-dependent as well as affected by temperature (37 and 4°C) and endocytic inhibitors, which revealed C3G nanoliposomes penetrate cells via endocytosis. Moreover, compared with C3G, C3G nanoliposomes significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8), suggesting a stronger anti-inflammatory potential. Conclusively, the uptake of C3G nanoliposomes by Caco-2/RAW 264.7 co-culture model is mainly involved in macropinocytosis and endocytosis mediated by carrier protein (clathrin). C3G nanoliposomes may play a better role in the treatment of LPS-induced intestinal inflammation diseases."

      "abstract": "Chinese bayberry has been used to treat diarrhea in China for more than 2,000 years, but the mechanism is not clear. Due to the extensive use of antibiotics, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is becoming more and more common in clinic, but there is no effective drug for the treatment. The present study aimed to explore the therapeutic effect of Chinese bayberry on AAD for the first time, and explained the underlying mechanism from different aspects. The BALB/c mice model was established by intragastric administration of lincomycin (3 g/kg). Successfully modeled mice were treated with purified water, dried bayberry powder suspension (100 mg/kg), C3G suspension (40 mg/kg) and montmorillonite powder suspension (40 mg/kg), respectively. The changes of body weight, diarrhea index, diarrhea status score were recorded and calculated regularly. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, intestinal immunofluorescence and inflammatory factor detection were further performed. The treatment with dried bayberry powder suspension and C3G suspension could rapidly reduce the diarrhea score and diarrhea index, increase food intake and restore body weight gain. The gut microbiota richness and diversity were significantly increased after dried bayberry powder suspension and C3G suspension treatments, typically decreased bacterial genera Enterococcus and Clostridium senus stricto 1. In addition, intake of Chinese bayberry powder and C3G significantly decreased the level of p65 phosphorylation, and up-regulated the expression of intestinal tight junction protein claudin-1 and ZO-1. Chinese bayberry fruit had the effect of alleviating AAD, and C3G was supposed to play the predominant role. The mechanism was indicated to be related with restoring the homeostasis of gut microbiota, inhibiting the level of harmful bacteria and increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria, down-regulating TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12 factors to reduce inflammation, restoring intestinal tight junction proteins and reducing intestinal permeability."

      "abstract": "Microplastic pollution has attracted growing attention due to its prevalent and persistent exposure to general population through the food chain, but few reports have focused on the toxicological prevention of polystyrene (PS). Using the wild-type and mutant strains, this study explored the impacts of PS and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) on stress tolerance and lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). In N2 nematodes, PS exposure initiated the oxidative stress and subsequent lifespan reduction, while these adverse impacts could be positively improved by C3G treatment. Considering the pivotal role of DAF-16 pathway in stress tolerance and lifespan regulation, the expression of the daf-16 gene and its downstream antioxidant genes (clt-2, hsp-16.1, sod-3, sod-5) were examined, and found to be significantly enhanced by C3G. Since the sod-3 gene was up-regulated the most fold by C3G, the activity of SOD enzyme that encoded by the sod-3 was examined, and could be obviously enhanced upon C3G treatment. This explained the improved oxidative stress and delayed oxidation-associated aging after C3G intervention. Nevertheless, these positive effects of C3G were weakened in daf-16(-) mutant strain (with deleted DAF-16 gene), for which the beneficial effects of C3G in promoting stress resistance and lifespan extension were inhibited. These findings suggested that the DAF-16 gene and its downstream antioxidant genes, have participated in C3G's regulations on redox balance and lifespan that impacted by nano-polystyrene particles. This study highlighted the link between dietary components and environmentally driven disturbance.",

Thermal treatment promoted the formation of 7S-C3G complexes via hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds but did not induce the formation of 7S-C3G covalent products. Thermal treatment at 65 °C and 121 °C enhanced the binding affinity of 7S-C3G complexes by 46.19 % and 1203 % compared with 25 °C. The 7S-C3G interaction decreased C3G bioaccessibility by 4.37 %, 8.74 %, and 46.37 % at 25 °C, 65 °C, and 121 °C. Diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ABTS antioxidant capacity assay indicated an antagonistic effect between 7S and C3G. The increased binding affinity of C3G to 7S limited the bioaccessibility of C3G and promoted the antagonism of antioxidant capacity between 7S and C3G. 7S addition was detrimental to the antioxidant capacity and bioaccessibility of C3G in vitro after thermal processing.",

It also relieved SP-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), 400 mg/kg C3G treatment increasing epithelial-cadherin mRNA expression and decreasing α-smooth muscle actin mRNA expression to the level of that in the control group. Western blot analysis showed that exposure to SP increased the production of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by 4.71- and 4.15-fold, respectively, in the lungs of mice, which were significantly inhibited by C3G treatment. Moreover, 400 mg/kg C3G treatment up-regulated two important antioxidant mediators, nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2; 4.91-fold) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1; 4.81-fold). The mechanism study indicated that C3G might inhibit the TGF-β/mTOR signaling via the NRF2/HO-1 pathway and that SP-induced pulmonary EMT was ameliorated by inhibiting the TGF-β/mTOR signaling pathway. Our findings could provide new avenues for C3G as a functional food for preventing or mediating the progression of SP-induced pulmonary fibrosis."

C3G induced HGF production at both mRNA and protein levels in NHDF cells and enhanced the phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein. We also observed that treatment with C3G increased intracellular cAMP level and promoter activity of cAMP-response element in HEK293 cells expressing β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR). In contrast, cyanidin, an aglycon of C3G, did not show the activation of β2AR signaling and HGF production. These results indicate that C3G behaves as an agonist for β2AR signaling to activate the protein kinase A pathway and induce the production of HGF."

      "abstract": "The impact of heat treatment at different temperatures on the interaction of β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) and anthocyanin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) was studied. Heat treatment and the addition of C3G changed the secondary structure of β-Lg with decreasing β-sheets and increasing random coils. Interactions between C3G and β-Lg were mainly via hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces at 25 °C. The elevated temperature promoted hydrophobic interactions between C3G and β-Lg due to an increase in the hydrophobic groups and amino groups on the surface of β-Lg molecules. The addition of β-Lg to the C3G eliminated heat-induced thermal degradation of C3G. The β-Lg-C3G interactions accompanied with increased particle size and constant zeta potential could increase the antioxidant capacity of C3G approximately by 4% to 10% and protect the colour of C3G from degradation under heat treatment. The C3G bioaccessibility with β-Lg addition increased by 26.08%, 33.45%, 83.09%, 72.27%, and 354.62% compared with C-25, C-60, C-85, C-100, and C-121, respectively. The protective effect of the non-covalent interactions on C3G at high temperatures (85 °C to 121 °C) was significantly stronger than at 25 °C and 60 °C. The application of β-Lg in foodstuffs could enhance the antioxidant activity and bioaccessibility of C3G.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial degenerative disease of the central nervous system, which affects mostly older adults. To date, research has focused on the progression of PD. Simultaneously, it was confirmed that the imbalances in gut microbiota are associated with the onset and progression of PD. Accurate diagnosis and precise treatment of PD are currently deficient due to the absence of effective biomarkers. METHODS: In this study, the pharmacodynamic study of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside in PD mice was used. It intends to use the \"imbalance\" and \"balance\" of intestinal microecology as the starting point to investigate the \"gut-to-brain\" hypothesis using metabolomic-combined 16S rRNA gene sequencing methods. Simultaneously, metabolomic analysis was implemented to acquire differential metabolites, and microbiome analysis was performed to analyze the composition and filter the remarkably altered gut microbiota at the phylum/genera level. Afterward, metabolic pathway and functional prediction analysis of the screened differential metabolites and gut microbiota were applied using the MetaboAnalyst database. In addition, Pearson's correlation analysis was used for the differential metabolites and gut microbiota. We found that cyanidin-3-O-glucoside could protect 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropy ridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice. RESULTS: Metabolomic analysis showed that MPTP-induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota significantly altered sixty-seven metabolites. The present studies have also shown that MPTP-induced PD is related to lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and so on. The 16S rRNA sequencing analysis indicated that 5 phyla and 22 genera were significantly altered. Furthermore, the differential gut microbiota was interrelated with amino acid metabolism, and so on. The metabolites and gut microbiota network diagram revealed significant correlations between 11 genera and 8 differential metabolites. CONCLUSION: In combination, this study offers potential molecular biomarkers that should be validated for future translation into clinical applications for more accurately diagnosing PD. Simultaneously, the results of this study lay a basis for further study of the association between host metabolisms, gut microbiota, and PD."

Mechanistically, the primary role of the PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway was detected by RNA sequencing, and the PERK-pathway-related protein expression, especially the pro-apoptotic marker C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression, was significantly downregulated by C3G treatment. The critical role of CHOP in mediating the protective effect of C3G was further validated by small interfering RNA. Conclusively, C3G could ameliorate PA-induced pancreatic beta cell dysfunction targeting the CHOP-related ER stress pathway, which might be used as a nutritional intervention for the preservation of beta cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

      "abstract": "Overcoming resistance to alkylating agents has important clinical significance in glioma. Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) has a tumor-suppressive effect on tumor cells. However, whether it plays a role in temozolomide resistance in glioma is still unclear. We constructed a TMZ-resistant LN-18/TR glioma cell line, observed the effect of C3G on TMZ resistance in this cell line, and explored the role of miR-214-5p in chemoresistance. Results showed that β-catenin and MGMT were significantly upregulated in LN-18/TR cells. C3G upregulated miR-214-5p and enhanced the cytotoxic effect of temozolomide on LN-18/TR cells. Contrarily, C3G downregulated β-catenin and MGMT. Moreover, the miR-214-5p mimic downregulated β-catenin and MGMT in LN-18/TR cells, whereas the miR-214-5p inhibitor had the opposite effect; the miR-214-5p inhibitor significantly blocked the C3G-induced downregulation of β-catenin and MGMT. C3G or the miR-214-5p mimic enhanced temozolomide-induced apoptosis in LN-18/TR cells, whereas the miR-214-5p inhibitor blocked this effect. Furthermore, C3G or miR-214-5p agomir combined with TMZ significantly inhibited the growth of LN-18/TR tumors. Collectively, our research discovered the potential signaling mechanism associated with C3G-mediated suppression of TMZ resistance in LN-18/TR cells through miR-214-5p, which can facilitate the treatment of MGMT-induced resistance in glioma cells.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The treatment of intervertebral disc degeneration is limited, cyanidin can protect chondrocytes from degeneration. This research investigated the effect of cyanidin on human nucleus pulposus cells (HNPC) metabolism and its mechanism. METHODS: HNPC were treated with cyanidin, XAV-939 (inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling) and SKL2001 (activator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling), and pressurized at 1, 3, and 30 atm. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot were used to assess the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), Collagen-II, Aggrecan, Wnt-3a and β-catenin in treated HNPC. Cell counting kit-8 was used to detect the HNPC cell viability. Radioisotope incorporation method was used to assess the proteoglycan synthesis rate of HNPC. The level of cell matrix was detected by toluidine blue staining. RESULTS: Proper hydrostatic pressure of 3 atm could elevate cell viability, proteoglycan synthesis and the level of cell matrix of HNPC, while high hydrostatic pressure of 30 atm reduced the above effects. Cyanidin and XAV-939 reversed the promoting effect of 30 atm pressure on Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and the inhibiting effect on cell viability, proteoglycan synthesis and the level of cell matrix. Subsequently, SKL2001 further reversed the function of cyanidin on HNPC. CONCLUSION: Cyanidin attenuated the high hydrostatic pressure-induced degradation of cellular matrix of HNPC via blocking the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Our findings in this research provided a basis for in vitro experiment of cyanidin and a theoretical fundament on this disease.",

However, the effects of C3G on glucose metabolism and its underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate the metabolic impact of C3G on db/db mice and to determine whether its consequent anti-diabetic effects were related to glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) by in vivo and in vitro studies. As a result, through diabetic db/db mice, C3G treatment was found to significantly reduce the fasting blood glucose level and increase glycogen synthesis, which were associated with upregulation of GLUT-1 expression in the liver of the mice. In addition, in liver cells of the HepG2 and L02 lines, we further discovered that C3G could effectively promote glucose consumption by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin-WISP1 signaling pathway. Nevertheless, such effects would be restricted when the expression of GLUT-1 was blocked by the inhibitor IWR-1. Meanwhile, molecular docking technology was applied to simulate the possible action sites of C3G at the molecular level, and the results indicated that C3G might bind to β-catenin. In conclusion, our study provided evidence of the antihyperglycemic effect of C3G in vivo and in vitro via regulating GLUT-1 expression and the related signaling pathways.",

      "abstract": "Neurotoxicity seriously affects the normal function of the nervous system. Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) is the most abundant anthocyanin widely distributed in plants. Using β-amyloid (Aβ) transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans and cell models, the neuroprotective effect of C3G was examined. The results showed that C3G remarkably suppressed Aβ aggregation, enhanced antioxidant capacity, improved the sensitive capacity towards chemical compounds, and boosted the memory ability of C. elegans. There was no significant difference between preventive and long-term treatment groups at the same dosage of C3G. Given the rapid metabolism and oxidation of C3G in vivo, the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities of C3G, the metabolite cyanidin (Cy), oxidation products of Cy (OP), as well as protocatechuic acid (PCA) at the corresponding level in OP were compared by using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglia cell model. The results indicated that C3G, Cy, and OP could prevent BV2 cells against LPS-induced inflammation and oxidative damage. There was no significant difference on antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities among C3G, Cy, and OP at the same level. Notably, PCA at the corresponding concentration in OP exhibited limited antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities. The results suggested that C3G could exert neuroprotective function through the metabolite Cy and its oxidation products by inhibiting inflammation and oxidative damage, and PCA was not the primary bioactive species in OP. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study confirmed the neuroprotection of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans. C3G, its metabolite cyanidin (Cy), and oxidation products of Cy (OP) alleviated both neuroinflammation and oxidative damage. It highlighted that C3G-rich foods could exert neuroprotective potential through their oxidation products, the constitution, and existence of OP in vivo need further study.",

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting, and 16S rDNA sequencing were used to study the expression of inflammation-related factors, activation of signal pathway-related proteins, and changes in the intestinal flora in ulcerative colitis (UC) mice. The results showed that HHP-treated C3G-BP complexes significantly relieved diarrhea and blood loss in the stool of UC mice and alleviated colon shortening. The potential mechanism of action involved reduction in intestinal oxidative stress mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory factors, improvement in anti-inflammatory factor levels, inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway, increased protein levels of Bcl-2/Bax and caspase-3/cleaved caspase-3 genes, and improved gut microbiota composition. Compared with other experimental groups, the HHP-treated C3G-BP complexes group exhibited the best anti-inflammatory effect on DSS-induced UC mice. The results may provide new ideas for using C3G-BP complexes for treating UC and help develop better processing methods.",

It has been noted that inflammation may impact fertility by affecting testicular spermatogenesis. Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside is a natural functional pigment with various health benefits. Nevertheless, studies on the mechanism by which C3G protects male reproduction in mice with ulcerative colitis remain scarce. The purpose of this study is to illustrate the potential mechanism of C3G for improving impaired fertility caused by colitis. A DSS-induced colitis model was applied to assess the effects of sperm quality with colitis and the health benefit role of C3G. Results indicated that C3G-treated mice exhibited higher body weight, longer colon length, less crypt damage and focal inflammation infiltration. Being consistent with that, low sperm count, low testis weight, high inflammation levels and abnormal thickness of seminiferous epithelium also observed in the DSS group were significantly recovered upon C3G treatment. These findings suggested that colitis has a close link to impaired fertility. Further analysis found that C3G could significantly suppress the inflammatory mediators in serum. Results conjointly indicated that C3G might improve the impaired fertility of mice with colitis by inhibiting inflammatory cytokines through the blood-testis barrier. C3G could be a promising daily supplement for ameliorating impaired fertility caused by colitis.",

HPP was found to have a positive effect on the binding between the two molecules, and the binding rate was increased by 32.8% after treatment (500 MPa/15 min). The increase in the binding rate is mainly due to the influence of high pressure on noncovalent effects such as hydrogen bonding and hydrophobicity. The results indicate that high pressure can be used to maintain the antioxidant capacity of C3G and improve the stability of C3G. The C3G retention rate is increased by 34.0% and 38.3% after heat treatment and simulated digestion, respectively.

A balanced gut microbiota contributes to many health benefits, which is readily influenced by environmental chemicals such as MPs. Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), a bioactive compound of the anthocyanin family, possesses a variety of functional effects including anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory, as well as gut microbiota modulation. C3G has been demonstrated to prevent polystyrene (PS) induced toxicities in Caco-2 cells and Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) via activating autophagy and promoting discharge. In the present study, we aimed to explore the alleviation effect of C3G on PS induced toxicities in C57BL/6 mice. Our results showed that the supplementation of C3G effectively reduced the tissue accumulation and promoted the fecal PS discharge, leading to alleviation of the PS-caused oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Meanwhile, C3G modulated PS-associated gut microbiome perturbations and regulated functional bacteria in inflammation such as Desulfovibrio, Helicobacter, Oscillospiraceae and Lachnoclostridium. Also, C3G administration initiated alterations in functional pathways in response to xenobiotic PS, and reduced bacterial functional genes related to inflammation and human diseases. These findings may offer evidence for the protective role of C3G in the intervention of PS-induced toxicity and gut dysbiosis.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic disorder, which commonly happens among senile people worldwide, is an important sign of aging. The early symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases include a decrease in energy metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction. Comparably, early dietary intervention may be more effective in preventing or delaying brain aging, owing to its role in regulating metabolism. Polyphenol intake has shown its potential in preventing Alzheimer's disease. However, whether there are close connections between polyphenols and the energy metabolism of the brain during aging remains unclear. This study sought to evaluate whether cyanidin 3-O-β-galactoside from black chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa (Michx.) Elliott) has positive effects on energy metabolism, as well as cognitive function in aging mice. Intragastrical administration of cyanidin 3-O-β-galactoside (25 and 50 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks effectively alleviated the decline in brain glucose uptake (decline rate 18.29% versus 1.05%, 7.63%) of aging mice. Moreover, cyanidin 3-O-β-galactoside also alleviated neuronal damage in the hippocampus (number of neurons 212.33 ± 16.19 versus 285.33 ± 29.53, 301.67 ± 10.07; p < 0.05) and cortex (number of neurons 82.00 ± 4.58 versus 111.67 ± 6.51, 112.00 ± 1.00; p < 0.05). Furthermore, cyanidin 3-O-β-galactoside reduced β-amyloid load in the brain and significantly increased the crossing-platform number (0.92 ± 1.11 versus 1.83 ± 0.68, 2.08 ± 0.58; p < 0.05) in the Morris water maze test. We further determined that protein kinase B (AKT) might be the target of cyanidin 3-O-β-galactoside, which played a beneficial role in controlling the energy metabolism of the brain. These results suggested that early intervention of anthocyanins could promote neuroprotection under the challenge of brain energy metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Tyrosinase, exquisitely catalyzes the phenolic compounds into brown or black pigment, inhibition is used as a treatment for dermatological or neurodegenerative disorders. Natural products, such as cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and (-/+)-catechin, are considered safe and non-toxic food additives in tyrosinase inhibition but their ambiguous inhibitory mechanism against tyrosinase is still elusive. Thus, we presented the mechanistic insights into tyrosinase with cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and (-/+)-catechin using computational simulations and in vitro assessment. Initial molecular docking results predicted ideal docked poses (- 9.346 to - 5.795 kcal/mol) for tyrosinase with selected flavonoids. Furthermore, 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations and post-simulation analysis of docked poses established their stability and oxidation of flavonoids as substrate by tyrosinase. Particularly, metal chelation via catechol group linked with the free 3-OH group on the unconjugated dihydropyran heterocycle chain was elucidated to contribute to tyrosinase inhibition by (-/+)-catechin against cyanidin-3-O-glucoside. Also, predicted binding free energy using molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area for each docked pose was consistent with in vitro enzyme inhibition for both mushroom and murine tyrosinases. Conclusively, (-/+)-catechin was observed for substantial tyrosinase inhibition and advocated for further investigation for drug development against tyrosinase-associated diseases.",

In this study, we explored the role and action mechanism of C3G in high glucose (HG)-induced damage of human nucleus pulposus cells (HNPCs). Cell viability was assessed by CCK-8 assay. TUNEL assay was performed for detecting apoptotic rate. Western blot was performed to determine the expression levels of cl-caspase-3, caspase-3, Bax, Bim, collagen II, aggrecan, MMP-3, MMP-13, and ADAMTS5. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was analyzed using DCFH-DA staining. The Nrf2 was knocked down or overexpressed in HNPCs through transfection with si-Nrf2 or pcDNA3.0-Nrf2. C3G treatment (12.5, 25, and 50 μM) improved cell viability of HNPCs under HG condition. HG-induced cell apoptosis of HNPCs was attenuated by C3G with decreased apoptotic rate and relative levels of cl-caspase-3/caspase-3, Bax, and Bim. C3G treatment caused significant increase in expression levels of collagen II and aggrecan and decrease in the relative levels of MMP-3, MMP-13, and ADAMTS5. After treatment with C3G, ROS generation in HNPCs was markedly reduced. Treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reversed HG-induced cell apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. C3G treatment induced the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 in HG-induced HNPCs. Moreover, knockdown of Nrf2 reversed the inhibitory effect of C3G on ROS production. Summarily, C3G exerted a protective effect on ROS-mediated cellular damage in HNPCs under HG condition, which was attributed to the induction of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.",

Assessing the value of sporadic beneficial diet is critical for practical application. We aimed to determine whether and how the cardioptotective effect of dietary intake of anthocyanins persists. Gene expression, histology and resistance to I/R were investigated ex vivo in hearts from mice after a month beyond the cease of the C3G-enriched diet. Cardiac injury, oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage following I/R was effectively reduced in mice fed C3G-enriched diet, even after a month of wash out with standard diet. Cardioprotection was observed also in immune-deficient mice lacking mature B and T cells indicating the anti-inflammatory activity of C3G was not involved. Moreover, the transcription reprogramming induced by the C3G-enriched diets was rescued by the wash out treatment. Instead, we found C3G-enriched diet changed the microbiome and the transplantation of the fecal microbiota transferred the cardioprotection from mice fed C3G-enriched diet to mice fed standard diet. These findings established the effect of C3G dietary intake on gut microbiota determines long lasting cardioprotection.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a disease associated with an oxidative milieu that often leads to adverse health outcomes. Multiple anthocyanins have been reported to possess outstanding antioxidant activity, however, their effects on hyperglycemia-related oxidative stress remain elusive. In the present study, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), a typical anthocyanin with various widely accepted health benefits, was applied to alleviate oxidative stress in pancreas islets under the conditions of hyperglycemia. Firstly, significantly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and antioxidant enzymes, as well as increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and O2- levels, were detected after exposure to a series of concentrations of high glucose (HG) and palmitic acid (PA), which manifested oxidative stress triggered by mitochondrial damage. To evaluate the antioxidant effect of C3G in vitro, the islet cell line NIT-1 was used, and results proved that C3G could effectively relieve cellular oxidative stress induced by HG and PA. Furthermore, we found that the antioxidant effect of C3G was achieved by activating mitophagy via the PINK1-PARKIN signaling pathway. More importantly, an autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) was added to verify our findings at the protein level, and we observed the co-localization of mitochondria and lysosomes, which may form autophagolysosomes to clean damaged mitochondria. Immediately afterwards, more studies were conducted on pancreatic islets of diabetic db/db mice to verify the antioxidant effect of C3G discovered in islet cells. Along with the decline in fasting blood glucose, the oxidative stress in pancreas islets was successfully alleviated in diabetic db/db mice after supplementation with C3G. This was demonstrated by increased levels of ROS, and the impaired activities of anti-oxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were partly reversed by C3G intervention. Our study has provided evidence for the alleviation effect of C3G against oxidative stress in pancreas islets, which may provide enlightenment for improving the health situation of diabetic patients in the future.",

      "abstract": "Experimental and clinical studies suggest a positive impact of anthocyanins on bone health; however, the mechanisms of anthocyanins altering the differentiation and function of osteoblasts and osteoclasts are not fully understood. This work demonstrates that dietary anthocyanins and resveratrol increased proliferation of cultured human hFOB 1.19 osteoblasts. In addition, treatment of serum starvation of hFOB osteoblasts with anthocyanins and resveratrol at 1.0 μg/ml reduced apoptosis, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, p53, and HDAC1 expression, but increased SIRT1/3 and PGC1α mRNA expression, suggesting mitochondrial and epigenetic regulation. In Sp7/osterix:mCherry transgenic medaka, peonidin-3-O-glucoside and resveratrol increased osteoblast differentiation and increased the expression of Sp7/osterix. Cyanidin, peonidin-3-O-glucoside, and resveratrol also reduced RANKL-induced ectopic osteoclast formation and bone resorption in col10α1:nlGFP/rankl:HSE:CFP medaka in doses of 1-4 μg/ml. The results indicate that both cyanidin and peonidin-3-O-glucoside have anabolic effects on bone, increasing osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and by altering the osteoblast epigenome. Cyanidin and peonidin-3-O-glucoside also reduced RANKL-induced bone resorption in a transgenic medaka model of bone resorption. Thus, peonidin-3-O-glucoside and cyanidin appear to both increase bone formation and reduce bone loss, suggesting that they be further investigated as potential treatments for osteoporosis and osteomalacia.",

      "abstract": "Islet transplantation is being considered as an alternative treatment for type 1 diabetes. Despite recent progress, transplant recipients continue to experience progressive loss of insulin independence. Cyanidin-3-O-Glucoside (C3G) has shown to be protective against damage that may lead to post-transplant islet loss. In this study, human islets cultured with or without C3G were treated with human amylin, Aβ1-42, H2O2, or rapamycin to mimic stresses encountered in the post-transplant environment. Samples of these islets were collected and assayed to determine C3G's effect on cell viability and function, reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress, amyloid formation, and the presence of inflammatory as well as autophagic markers. C3G treatment of human islets exposed to either amylin or Aβ1-42 increased cell viability (p<0.01) and inhibited amyloid formation (p<0.01). A reduction in ROS and an increase in HO-1 gene expression as well as in vitro islet function were also observed in C3G-treated islets exposed to amylin or Aβ1-42, although not significantly. Additionally, treatment with C3G resulted in a significant reduction in the protein expression of inflammatory markers IL-1β and NLRP3 (p<0.01) as well as an increase in LC3 autophagic marker (p<0.05) in human islets treated with amylin, Aβ1-42, rapamycin, or H2O2. Thus, C3G appears to have a multi-faceted protective effect on human islets in vitro, possibly through its anti-oxidant property and alteration of inflammatory as well as autophagic pathways.",

A series of nanofibersolosome formulations (CFS-0.5-4, 0.5-4 represent the ratios of Fibersol®-2:lipoid S75) were developed and their performance was compared with Fibersol®-2-free reference lipid formulation (CFS-0). The nanofibersolosomes (<150 nm) were spherical and unilamellar with high negative surface charge (-38 to -51 mV) and good encapsulation efficiency (EE > 90%). They performed much better than CFS-0 in retaining their physical properties during freeze drying, preventing particle aggregation, and retaining C3G during storage (4 and 25 ℃) and thermal treatments (40, 60, and 80 ℃). They also exhibited significantly higher stability during simulated gastrointestinal digestion than CFS-0. These desirable features of the nanofibersolosomes (especially CFS-0.5 and CFS-1) led to the efficient delivery of higher concentrations of C3G to the colon than CFS-0. Moreover, gastrointestinal-digested and colonic-fermented nanofibersolosome samples exhibited significantly higher DPPH radical scavenging activity and stronger promoting effect on short-chain fatty acid generation than CFS-0. These in vitro findings indicate that the novel nanofibersolosome possesses great potential for the colonic delivery of C3G and likely other hydrophilic labile phytochemicals that merits further evaluation in in vivo models.",

It has protective and therapeutic effects on various diseases. It can reduce neuronal death from amyloid-beta (Aβ)-induced toxicity and promote the inhibition of Aβ fibrillization. Antioxidant and immune modulation might play a critical role in the properties of C3G against Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other diseases. However, limited studies have been performed on the mechanism involved in the effect of C3G through transcriptome analysis. Thus, the objective of this study was to perform comparative transcriptome analysis of the spleen to determine gene expression profiles of wild-type mice (C57BL/6J Jms), an Alzheimer's mouse model (APPswe/PS1dE9 mice), and a C3G-treated Alzheimer's mouse model. Differentially expressed antioxidant, immune-related, and AD pathways genes were identified in the treated group. The validation of gene expression data via RT-PCR studies further supported the current findings. Six important antioxidant genes (S100a8, S100a9, Prdx2, Hp, Mpst, and Prxl2a) and a high number of immune-related genes were found to be upregulated in the treatment groups, suggesting the possible antioxidant and immunomodulatory mechanisms of C3G, respectively. Further studies are strongly recommended to elucidate the precise role of these essential genes and optimize the therapeutic function of C3G in AD and other disease conditions."

The exposure of RINm5F cells to C3Ghv at concentration of 100 and 200 μg/mL for 24 h reduced 10% and 23% cell viability, respectively, as compared to control cells. The pre-treatment of RINm5F cells with C3Ghv (50 µg/mL) increased the cell viability by 29% as compared to control, on being treated with STZ (10 mM) for 24 h. The pre-treatment of RINm5F cells with C3Ghv (50 µg/mL) for 24 h followed by exposure to STZ (10 mM) for 1 h decreased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by 57%, generation of nitric oxide by 22.8%, generation of malondialdehyde (MDA) by 32%, the production of p-ERK ½ by 83%, p-JNK by 82.6%, p-MEK by 57%, and p-p38 MAPK by 64%. The C3Ghv treatment also decreased the ratio of apoptotic proteins Bax to Bcl-2 by 61%, and improved the M2 phase of cell cycle by 75% as compared to STZ treated cells. The overall results suggest that C3Ghv protects pancreatic β-cells against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, thereby implicating the significant role of C3Ghv as an antidiabetic agent."

Although the animal and clinical studies are inadequate, based on the accumulated evidence, we propose that the interaction of Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside with the intestinal mucosal immune system is at the core of most mechanisms by which affect host gut diseases. This review puts forward the potential mechanism of action and targeted treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Investigation on potentiation of existing drugs with natural compounds to enhance efficacy and reduce toxic effect of the drugs has been increasing in recent years. This paper reports cytotoxic effect (apoptosis-related and oxidative stress-related effect) of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), cisplatin (DDP), and their combination (C3G-DDP) on cervical cancer HeLa cells. Concentration of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was determined by employing fluorescent marker 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. On the other hand, malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) concentration, and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were quantitated by commercially available assay kits. C3G-DDP significantly inhibited the activity of SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px. Simultaneously, C3G-DDP reduced GSH concentration while increased the concentration of ROS and MDA. Moreover, Western blot analysis suggested that C3G-DDP significantly reduced the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) and Nrf2 target proteins: heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1). In contrast, C3G-DDP increased the expression of Keap1. Furthermore, C3G-DDP significantly upregulated and downregulated the mRNA expressions of bax and bcl-2, respectively, thereby increasing bax/bcl-2 mRNA expression ratio. Overall, our findings propose that potentiation of DDP with C3G improves cancer cell susceptibility, specifically cervical cancer cells, to DDP. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Cisplatin is recommended by most medical oncologists worldwide to treat cancer. Despite its neoplastic efficacy, it has undesirable side effects including nausea, vomiting, nephrotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity. Natural biologically active food ingredients are suggested to be used as antioxidants along with DDP therapy to prevent cisplatin-induced toxicity. C3G-DDP protected HeLa cells from oxidative stress by reducing NQO1 and HO-1 levels and regulated the Nrf2 signaling pathway. In addition, C3G-DDP protected HeLa cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by increasing bcl-2 levels and decreasing bax levels. These results expanded our understanding of the role of C3G in a cervical cancer cell model, and provided a potential new treatment strategy for this cancer, as well as a theoretical basis for the development of new drugs in the future.",

The effects of C3G and PCA on cell viability, LDH release and apoptosis in IQ-induced HepG2 cells were evaluated using CCK-8, LDH release and flow cytometry assays, respectively. TMT-based proteomics was utilized to characterize the proteins and pathways associated with the improvement after C3G and PCA treatment. Results showed that exposure to IQ significantly increased cytotoxicity and apoptosis in HepG2 cells, which were alleviated by C3G and PCA. C3G was more effective than PCA in protecting HepG2 cells against IQ-induced cytotoxicity and regulating the related signaling pathways. Proteomics and bioinformatics analyses and Western blot validation revealed that apoptosis-related signaling pathways played pivotal roles in protecting against the cytotoxicity of IQ by C3G, and XIAP was identified as the target protein. Molecular docking proved that C3G had strong binding affinity to XIAP and hindered the binding of IQ to the BIR3 domain of XIAP, resulting in the inhibition of apoptosis. Our findings suggested that C3G has potential as a preventive food ingredient to prevent carcinogenic risk of heterocyclic aromatic amines.",

Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) are considered a potential source of pluripotent stem cells. hAECs have been used as a novel tool in regenerative cellular therapy and cell differentiation studies. In this study, to explore the effects of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (Cy3G) on hAECs and their mechanisms, we investigated the transcriptomic changes in the Cy3G-treated cells using microarray analysis. Among the differentially expressed genes (Fold change > 1.1; p-value < 0.05), 109 genes were upregulated and 232 were downregulated. Ratios of upregulated and downregulated genes were 0.22% and 0.47% of the total expressed genes, respectively. Next, we explored the enriched gene ontology, i.e., the biological process, molecular function, and cellular component of the 37 upregulated (>1.3-fold change) and 124 downregulated (<1.3-fold change) genes. Significantly enriched biological processes by the upregulated genes included \"response to muscle activity,\" and the genes involved in this gene ontology (GO) were Metrnl and SRD5A1, which function in the adipocyte. On the other hand, the cell cycle biological process was significantly enriched by the downregulated genes, including some from the SMC gene family. An adipogenesis-associated gene DDX6 was also included in the cell cycle biological process. Thus, our findings suggest the prospects of Cy3G in modulating adipocyte differentiation in hAECs.",

The cell cycle proteins and antimitotic drugs might be promising therapeutic targets in hepatocellular carcinoma. AIM: To investigate the effect of cyan administration on cell cycle in hepatic precancerous lesion (PCL) induced by diethylnitrosamine/2-acetylaminofluorene (DEN/2-AAF) in Wistar rats. METHODS: In vivo, DEN/2-AAF-induced hepatic PCL, rats were treated with three doses of cyan (10, 15, and 20 mg/kg/d, for four consecutive days per week for 16 wk). Blood and liver tissue samples were collected for measurement of the followings; alpha fetoprotein (AFP) liver function and RNA panel differential expression was evaluated via real time polymerase chain reaction. Histopathological examination of liver sections stained with H&E and immunohistochemical study using glutathione S-transferase placental (GSTP) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) antibodies were assessed. RESULTS: Cyan administration mitigated the effect of DEN/2-AFF induced PCL, decreased AFP levels, and improved liver function. Remarkably, treatment with cyan dose dependently decreased the long non-coding RNA MALAT1 and tubulin gamma 1 mRNA expressions and increased the levels of miR-125b, all of which are involved in cell cycle and mitotic spindle assembly. Of note, cyan decreased GSTP foci percent area and PCNA positively stained nuclei. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that cyan could be used as a potential therapeutic agent to inhibit liver carcinogenesis in rat model via modulation of cell cycle.",

      "abstract": "Natural compounds have been increasingly investigated as substances enhancing the effect of drugs and reducing drug-related adverse reactions. The objective of this study was to determine how a combination of cisplatin (DDP) with cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) affected malignancy features of cervical cancer cells. The results demonstrated that the proliferation of HeLa cells treated with 5 µg/ml DDP, 400 µg/ml C3G, or a combination of both (5 µg/ml DDP and 400 µg/ml C3G) was inhibited by 17.43%, 34.98%, and 63.38%, respectively. The IC50 values for DDP and the DDP/C3G combination treatments in HeLa cells were 18.53 and 6.435 µg/ml, respectively. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that treatment with DDP, C3G, or the combination induced G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HeLa cells. Furthermore, after treatment, cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 levels decreased; Bax, cleaved caspase-3, p53, and TIMP-1 were activated; and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was modulated. These anticancer effects were enhanced in cells treated with the combination of DDP and C3G compared to those treated with DDP or C3G alone. Our study indicates that C3G increases the antitumor activity of DDP, suggesting a potential strategy to reduce adverse effects associated with chemotherapy in cervical cancer. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Natural biologically active food ingredients are suggested to have a potential to enhance the effect of chemotherapy in cancer. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because it revealed, for the first time, that C3G could increase the antitumor activity of DDP, suggesting a potential strategy to reduce adverse effects associated with chemotherapy in cervical cancer.",

      "abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-17A signaling pathway plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and represents a viable target for RA therapy. Cyanidin, a flavonoid compound, is a novel inhibitor of IL-17A/IL-17RA (receptor subunit A) interaction in several inflammatory diseases. However, the therapeutic efficacy of cyanidin on IL-17A cytokine signaling induced monocyte migration and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) released RANKL mediated osteoclastogenesis in RA has not yet been deciphered. In the present study, cyanidin impeded IL-17A induced migration of monocytes isolated from adjuvant-induced arthritic (AA) rats. At the molecular level, cyanidin blocked the activation of p38MAPK signaling in response to IL-17A. Importantly, cyanidin downregulated IL-17A induced expression of HSP27, CXCR4, and CCR7 in AA monocytes via modulating IL-17/p38 MAPK signaling axis. Alternatively, cyanidin significantly suppressed the formation of matured osteoclasts and bone resorption in a coculture system consisting of IL-17 treated AA-FLS and rat bone marrow-derived monocytes/macrophages. Further, cyanidin significantly inhibited the expression of RANKL and increased the expression of OPG in AA-FLS via blunted activation of IL-17A/STAT-3 signaling cascade. Interestingly, cyanidin impaired IL-17A induced overexpression of IL-17RA. Taken together, our study proposes a novel therapeutic function of cyanidin towards targeted inhibition of IL-17A/IL-17RA signaling mediated disease severity and bone erosion in RA.",

The results indicated that Cy‑3‑g significantly inhibited the mean pulmonary artery pressure, right ventricular systolic pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy index, as well as vascular remodeling induced by MCT in PAH rats. Further experiments showed that Cy‑3‑g suppressed the expression of pro‑-inflammatory factors and enhanced the levels of anti‑inflammatory factors. Cy‑3‑g blocked oxidative stress and improved vascular endothelial injury. Cy‑3‑g also reduced the proliferation of SMCs. Furthermore, the MCT‑ and TGF‑β1‑induced increase in TGF‑β1, phosphorylated (p)‑p38 mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p‑cAMP‑response element binding protein (CREB) expression was blocked by Cy‑3‑g treatment in vivo and in vitro.

Therefore, it is extremely urgent to study the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. It has been reported that anthocyanins can regulate bone metabolism and prevent osteoporosis. Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), the most common type of anthocyanin in nature, widely exists in a variety of vegetables and fruits. Although it has been shown that C3G has multiple effects on osteoclasts, its impact(s) and underlying mechanism(s) on osteoblasts are still not clear. Here, we evaluated the effect of C3G on cell proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts (extracted from the hip joint of patients with osteoporosis) and MC3T3-E1 (a kind of osteoblast cell line from mice). We also test the ability of osteoblasts to mineralize after C3G treatment. To find the underlying mechanism of the above effects, we further evaluated the role of the ERK signaling pathway in C3G regulation of osteoblasts. The results showed that C3G treatment enhanced osteoblast proliferation rate, osteoblast mineralization points, the mRNA levels and protein expression levels of OC (osteocalcin), and the level of ERK phosphorylation, which could be blocked by pretreatment with ERK signaling pathway inhibitor. The above results not only indicate that the ERK pathway was involved in C3G regulation of osteoblast differentiation but also provide strong suggestive evidence that osteoblasts may be promising targets in preventive and therapeutic strategies for osteoporosis."

The results showed the administration of C3G reduced the infarction area, mitigated pathological alterations, inhibited ST segment elevation, and attenuated oxidative stress and ferroptosis-related protein expression. C3G also suppressed the expressions of USP19, Beclin1, NCOA4, and LC3II/LC3I. In addition, treatment with C3G relieved oxidative stress, downregulated LC3II/LC3I, reduced autophagosome number, downregulated TfR1 expression, and upregulated the expressions of FTH1 and GPX4 in OGD/R-induced H9c2 cells. C3G could inhibit the protein levels of USP19 and LC3II. C3G promoted K11-linked ubiquitination of Beclin1. Further evidence that C3G reduced ferroptosis and ameliorated myocardial I/R injury was demonstrated with the ferroptosis promoter RSL3.

      "abstract": "Black soybean hull extract (BSHE) exhibits a variety of biological activities. However, little is known about the effects of BSHE on immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated type I allergic reactions. The anti-allergic effect of BSHE was assessed with the degranulation assay using rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells and the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction in mice. An active compound in BSHE was identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry analysis. BSHE inhibited the release of β-hexosaminidase and histamine in RBL-2H3 cells, and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) was identified as one of its active compounds. Oral administering of 200 μmol/kg of C3G to IgE-sensitized mice prior to antigen injection suppressed the PCA reaction, as compared with control (p < 0.01). Intravenous administration of BSHE (C3G content, 5.4%) more strongly inhibited PCA responses at lower doses (100 mg/kg, p < 0.01) than oral administration (1,000 mg/kg, p = 0.059). Intravenous C3G also suppressed PCA response at a low dose (40 mg/kg, p < 0.05), showing the same trend as BSHE. This information can be useful to design appropriate formulations of anthocyanin-based drug products to suppress allergic reactions. This study provides evidence for the potential use of BSHE and C3G for the prevention or the treatment of type I allergies.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation, diabetes, micro and macrovascular complications, and neurodegenerative diseases through the binding with RAGE. Natural compounds can act as an alternative in disease therapy related to the AGEs-RAGE interactions. Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside is one of the potential anthocyanins found in red rice. Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside in red rice may interfere with the AGEs-RAGE signaling so that the potential mechanism of their interaction needs to be elucidated. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the potency of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside in red rice as an inhibitor of AGE-RAGE signaling pathway through in silico analysis. METHODS: Our study used the 3D structures of AGEs and Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside compounds from PubChem and Receptor for AGEs (RAGE) from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) database. The molecular interactions of those compounds and RAGE were established using Hex 8.0 software, then visualized using Discovery Studio 2016 software. RESULTS: Argypirimidine, pentosidine, pyrralline, and imidazole bound to the ligand-binding domain of RAGE with the binding energy of -247 kcal/mol, -350.4 kcal/mol, -591.1 kcal/mol, and -100.4 kcal/mol, respectively. The presence of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside in the imidazole-RAGE-cyanidin-3-O-glucoside complex could inhibit the interaction of imidazole-RAGE with a binding energy of -299 kcal/mol, which was lower than of imidazole-RAGE complex. The establishment of AGEs-Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside-RAGE complex showed that cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, which bound first to Argypirimidine and Pyrralline, could bound to RAGE at the same residue as those two AGEs did with the binding energy of -411.8 kcal/mol and -1305 kcal/mol, respectively. Based on the binding site location and energy, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside might have a biological function as an inhibitor of AGEs-RAGE interactions, which was more likely through the establishment of AGEs-cyanidin-3-O-glucoside-RAGE. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that cyanidin-3-O-glucoside in red rice can be a potential AGEs-RAGE inhibitor, leading to the regulation of the pro-inflammatory and oxidative damage in the cellular pathway."

Here using a Drosophila model of a malignant tumor, wherein the activated oncogene Raf (RafGOF) cooperates with loss-of-function mutations in the conserved tumor suppressor scribble (scrib-/-), we investigated the antitumor mechanism of BBSCE and its main active component cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) in vivo. The results showed that supplementation of either BBSCE or C3G inhibited the tumor growth and invasion of RafGOFscrib-/- and extended their survival in a dose dependent manner. Strikingly, the activation of both autonomous and non-autonomous autophagy in tumor flies was significantly reduced by C3G treatment. A further study indicated that C3G exhibited an antitumor effect in vivo by blocking autophagy both in tumor cells and in its microenvironment by inhibiting the JNK pathway. Interestingly, the efficacy of chloroquine (CQ, an autophagy inhibitor used as an antitumor agent) combined with C3G is much better than either C3G or CQ treatment alone. C3G may be combined with CQ to treat cancers and to provide a theoretical basis for functional food or natural medicine development.",

After binding, the C3G concentration was found to be the highest (382.1 ± 13.2 μg/mg for BP) when using a C3G-BP mass ratio of 1:2, a pressure of 400 MPa, and a holding time of 15 min. HP processing decreased particle size and altered the characteristics of C3G-BP complexes. The main binding form of the complexes before HP treatment was pectin-wrapped C3G by hydrogen bond interaction, while HP caused charged groups in pectin to be more exposed and improve the electrostatic interaction between C3G and BP.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anthocyanins (ACNs) are capable of suppressing breast cancer growth; however, investigation on the effect and mechanism of ACNs on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and cell migration and invasion in breast cancer cells is limited. A complete understanding of those properties may provide useful information on of how to use these natural compounds for cancer prevention and treatment. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to investigate the role of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (Cy3G), one of the most widely distributed ACNs in edible fruits, in the EMT process, and cell migration and invasion of breast cancer cells, and its underlying molecular mechanisms of how Cy3G establishes these functional roles in these cells. METHODS: MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells were treated with Cy3G (20 μM) for 24 h, and then the cells were used for cell migration and invasion assay. Western blotting, luciferase assay, ubiquitination assay, gene knockdown, and cycloheximide chase assay were performed to analyze the molecular mechanisms of Cy3G in suppressing EMT, and cell migration and invasion. RESULTS: Cy3G inhibited the EMT process in these cells and significantly suppressed the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells (P ≤ 0.05) by upregulating Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) expression at protein level. KLF4 knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells did not reveal any change in EMT marker expression, and cell migration and invasion upon treatment with Cy3G (P ≥ 0.05), which strongly indicated that the effects of Cy3G were mediated by KLF4. Furthermore, we determined that Cy3G indirectly upregulated KLF4 expression by downregulating FBXO32, which is the E3 ligase of KLF4. CONCLUSION: Cy3G is a potential anticancer reagent as it can inhibit EMT and breast cancer cell migration and invasion by upregulating KLF4."

This study evaluated the effects of CY3D5G-rich extract on oxidative stress in D-galactose-induced accelerated aging. Thirty male C57BL/6 J mice were divided into three groups: a normal control group and two D-galactose-injected groups orally administered with or without CY3D5G-rich extract (700 μmol/kg body weight). Dietary supplementation of CY3D5G-rich extract for 6 weeks increased superoxide dismutase activity, glutathione peroxidase activity, and total antioxidant capacity while suppressed malondialdehyde content in serum (p < 0.05) and tissues. Hepatic proteome analysis revealed that 243 proteins were significantly modulated by experimental treatment (p < 0.05). CY3D5G-rich extract treatment suppressed proteins involved in electron transport chain and up-regulated proteins that play important roles in glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and actin cytoskeleton. These changes in above metabolic pathways may contribute to reducing the production and release of ROS and attenuating oxidative damage in aged mice. SIGNIFICANCE: Anthocyanins are the most abundant dietary flavonoids with potential health benefits. The proteomic analysis of mice liver in this study revealed the effect of cyanidin-3-diglucoside-5-glucoside (CY3D5G) consumption in D-galactose-induced accelerated aging. In total, 2054 protein groups were quantified in all samples without any missing value, and 243 protein groups were identified with statistical significance (p < 0.05). Bioinformatics analysis suggested that electron transport chain, glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and actin cytoskeleton were closely correlated with CY3D5G treatment. These findings provide useful information to understand the anti-aging effect of anthocyanin, and the results of which could promote the use of anthocyanins in food and pharmaceutical industries.",

In this paper, we have discovered that cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), which is one of the anthocyanins, could alleviate high glucose-induced podocyte dysfunction. MTT, flow cytometry assay, and Western blot analysis showed that C3G could reverse the increase of cell apoptosis under high glucose treatment in MPC5 cells by upregulation of Bcl2 and downregulation of Bax and cleaved caspase-3. Moreover, C3G improved the autophagy decrease that was induced by high glucose through regulating the expression level of LC3-II/LC3-I, Beclin1, and p62. In addition, C3G inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by increasing E-cadherin and reducing Vimentin. By further study of the mechanisms, we found C3G activated the SIRT1 and AMPK which were inhibited in high glucose condition. Silencing SIRT1 blocked the effect of C3G on regulating cell apoptosis, autophagy, and EMT. In summary, our current findings suggest the protective effect of C3G against high glucose-induced podocyte dysfunction is by improving autophagy and reducing apoptosis and EMT via activating SIRT1/AMPK pathway. It might be a new insight for the treatment of DN.",

Five-week-old male SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats received water (n = 8/SHR; n = 8/WKY), 10 mg kg-1 day-1 C3G (n = 8/SHR; n = 8/WKY), 10 mg kg-1 day-1 HCT (n = 8/SHR; n = 8/WKY), or 10 mg kg-1 day-1 C3G + 10 mg kg-1 day-1 HCT (n = 8/SHR; n = 8/WKY) by oral gavage for 15 weeks. Spleens were used to assess T-cell phenotypes via flow cytometry and concanavalin A stimulated ex vivo cytokine production (IL-2, IL-10, TNFα, IFNγ) using a cytometric bead array. SHR had lower proportions of helper T-cells (Th) that were T-regulatory, CD62Llo, CD62L- and CD25+ compared to WKY.

The proportion of T-regulatory and Th that were CD25+ were not affected by treatment in SHR. Stimulated splenocytes from SHR produced lower concentrations of cytokines compared to WKY. C3G treated SHR produced higher while HCT treated SHR produced lower TNFα and IFNγ concentrations compared to controls.

The sub-fractions and the purified RBC3G inhibited epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) characteristics of PC3 cells by blocking the expression of several cytoskeletal associate proteins in a concentration dependent manner, leading to decreasing of the cancer cell motility. RBC3G reduced the expression of Smad/Snail signaling molecules but enhanced the expression of cell surface protein, E-cadherin, leading to a delay tumor transformation. The RBC3G also inhibited matrix metalloproteinase-9 and nuclear factor-kappa B expression levels and the enzymes activity in PC3 cells, leading to a slow cell migration/invasion process. The results suggested that RBC3G blunt and/or delay the progressive cancer cell behaviors by inhibit EMT through Smad signaling pathway(s) mediating Snail/E-cadherin expression."

      "abstract": "Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of liver disease worldwide. In patients with ALD, an increased level of hepatic inflammasome components was observed, together with an increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside (Cy-3-G) is a bioactive compound belonging to the anthocyanin group, which widely exists in deep-colored fruits and vegetables. Consumption of Cy-3-G is associated with lower risks of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), liver fibrosis, obesity, atherosclerosis, and inflammation. However, whether Cy-3-G has effects on inflammasome formation and activation thereby protects against alcohol-induced liver damage remain elusive. In this study, we identified that dietary provision of Cy-3-G remarkably attenuated liver damage caused by excess energy intake and alcohol consumption. Supplement with Cy-3-G mediated NAD+ homeostasis, which stimulated SirT1 activity, resulting in suppressed NF-κB acetylation. Interestingly, Cy-3-G treatment suppressed NF-κB acetylation when SirT1 action was blunted by selective antagonist, and subsequently suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation and proinflammatory cytokines release in hepatic cell lines. Our findings first demonstrate that Cy-3-G at a physiologically achievable dosage alleviates alcohol-induced hepatic inflammation via inactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome and deacetylation of NF-κB, suggesting a promising therapeutic approach to alleviate alcohol-induced liver damage.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the cytoprotection and potential molecular mechanisms of cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative damage in HepG2 cells. METHODS: The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was carried out to examine the viability of HepG2 cells exposure to H2O2 or C3G. Meanwhile, the antioxidant properties of C3G were measured by determining the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT) and the malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Flow cytometry was employed to determine HepG2 cells apoptosis, and HepG2 cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 to observe cell morphology. 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) was used to evaluate the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Finally, the expression of apoptosis-related protein was monitored through western blot analysis. RESULTS: HepG2 cells induced with H2O2 presented a remarkable decrease in cell viability that was suppressed when HepG2 cells were interfered with C3G (2.5-10 μM). C3G interference memorably and dose-dependently inhibited H2O2-induced intracellular ROS and MDA overproduction, while C3G treatment markedly increased H2O2-induced the activities of intracellular SOD, GSH-Px and CAT. Eventually, the relative proteins expression levels of p53, cleaved caspase-9/3, cytochrome c, Fas-L, Fas, FADD and caspase-8 were substantially up-regulated in H2O2-triggered HepG2 cells, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the relative protein expression levels of PARP were dramatically down-regulated. However, the expression levels of these relative proteins were reversed in C3G-interfered HepG2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: C3G could protect HepG2 cells from oxidative damage, and the effects that were mediated by the mitochondrial apoptotic pathways and the external pathways.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the involvement of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), leptin, insulin and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in mediating metabolic beneficial effects of purified anthocyanin cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy3G). METHODS: Intestinal proglucagon gene (Gcg; encoding GLP-1) and liver Fgf21 expression were assessed in 6-wk-old male C57BL-6J mice fed a low-fat-diet (LFD; 10% of energy from fat), alone or with 1.6 mg Cy3G/L in drinking water for 3 wk [experiment (Exp.) 1; n = 5/group]. Similar mice were fed the LFD or a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% energy from fat) with or without Cy3G for 20 wk. Half of the mice administered Cy3G also received 4 broad-spectrum antibiotics (ABs) in drinking water between weeks 11 and 14, for a total of 6 groups (n = 8/group). Metabolic tolerance tests were conducted between weeks 2 and 16. Relevant hormone gene expression and plasma hormone concentrations were assessed mainly at the end of 20 wk (Exp. 2). RESULTS: In Exp. 1, Cy3G administration increased ileal but not colonic Gcg level by 2-fold (P < 0.05). In Exp. 2, Cy3G attenuated HFD-induced body-weight gain (20.3% at week 16), and improved glucose tolerance (26.5% at week 15) but not insulin tolerance. Although Cy3G had no effect on glucose tolerance in LFD mice, LFD/Cy3G/AB mice showed better glucose tolerance than LFD/Cy3G mice (23%). In contrast, HFD/Cy3G/AB mice showed worse glucose tolerance compared with HFD/Cy3G mice (15%). Beneficial effects of Cy3G in HFD mice were not associated with changes in plasma leptin, insulin or GLP-1 concentrations. However, Cy3G increased hepatic Fgf21 expression in mice in Exp. 1 by 4-fold and attenuated Fgf21 overexpression in HFD mice (Exp. 2, 22%), associated with increased expression of genes that encode FGFR1 and β-klotho (>3-fold, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Dietary Cy3G may reduce body weight and exert metabolic homeostatic effects in mice via changes in hepatic FGF21.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Identifying safe and effective compounds that target to mitophagy to eliminate impaired mitochondria may be an attractive therapeutic strategy for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Here, we investigated the effects of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the underlying mechanism. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was induced by a high-fat diet for 16 weeks. C3G was administered during the last 4 weeks. In vivo, recombinant adenoviruses and AAV8 were used for overexpression and knockdown of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), respectively. AML-12 and HepG2 cells were used for the mechanism study. KEY RESULTS: C3G administration suppressed hepatic oxidative stress, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and steatosis and improved systemic glucose metabolism in mice with NAFLD. These effects of C3G were also observed in palmitic acid-treated AML-12 cells and hepatocytes from NAFLD patients. Mechanistic investigations revealed that C3G increased PINK1/Parkin expression and mitochondrial localization and promoted PINK1-mediated mitophagy to clear damaged mitochondria. Knockdown of hepatic PINK1 abolished the mitophagy-inducing effect of C3G, which blunted the beneficial effects of C3G on oxidative stress, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, hepatic steatosis and glucose metabolism. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These results demonstrate that PINK1-mediated mitophagy plays an essential role in the ability of C3G to alleviate NAFLD and suggest that C3G may be a potential drug candidate for NAFLD treatment.",

Cyanidin 3-OGlucoside (C3G) has a potential to induce the apoptotic cell death in different cancer cells; however, the mechanisms of action for C3G have not been clarified yet. OBJECTIVE: In this study, the apoptotic effects of C3G on three different osteosarcoma cell lines including Saso-2, MG-63, and G-292 (clone A141B1) were investigated. METHODOLOGY: The 24-hr IC50 of C3G for Saso-2, G-292, and MG-63 cells was evaluated by the MTT assay. Apoptosis induction in these cell lines after treatment with the C3G was approved by the Annexin V/PI flow cytometry. Changes at the mRNA expression level of PPARγ, P21, Bax, and Bcl-xl genes were investigated by real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique, and P21 expression was further confirmed by the western blotting. RESULTS: The MTT assay results demonstrated that the 24-hr IC50 of C3G was equal to 110μg/ml for Saso-2 and G-292 cells while it was about 140μg/ml for the MG-63 cells. The results of real-time PCR clearly showed that treatment of the cells with 24hrs IC50 of C3G caused the upregulation of PPARγ, P21, and Bax genes. Moreover, western blot analysis confirmed that P21 protein overexpressed endogenously after treatment of the cells with the C3G, and it was more upregulated in the MG-63 cells compared to the other cell lines. CONCLUSION: According to the findings of the study, the C3G is a novel anti-osteosarcoma agent with the ability to induce the apoptosis in different osteosarcoma cells through upregulation of the PPARγ and P21 genes.",

The cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) benefits visual system and also possess anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory potentials. In the current study, the effects of C3G on human CECs (HCECs) against bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced disorders were assessed, and the mechanism driving the protective effect was explored by focusing on let-7b-5p-mediated HMGA2/PI3K/Akt pathway. The HCECs were incubated LPS of P. aeruginosa to induce inflammation and apoptosis, and then treated with C3G. The changes in cell viability, apoptosis, and inflammation were detected. Moreover, the effects of LPS and C3G on let-7b-5p level and HMGA2/PI3K/Akt pathway activity were also assessed. Thereafter, the HCECs were further transfected with let-7b-5p inhibitor to confirm its role in the vision-protective effects of C3G. The interaction between let-7b-5p and HMGA2 was verified with dual luciferase assay. The LPS treatment suppressed viability and induced apoptosis and inflammation in HCECs, which was associated with the down-regulated let-7b-5p level and up-regulated HMGA2/PI3K/Akt pathway activity. The impairments of LPS on HCECs were attenuated by C3G: the compound increased cell viability and inhibited apoptosis and inflammation. The C3G also induced let-7b-5p level and inactivated HMGA2/PI3K/Akt pathway. However, after the inhibition of let-7b-5p, the protective effects of C3G on HCECs against LPS were blocked. The results of dual luciferase assay showed the direct binding let-7b-5p to the promoter of HMGA2 gene. It was inferred that the C3G could ameliorate the LPS-induced disorders in HCECs. The effect depended on the induced level of let-7b-5p, which then inhibited HMGA2/PI3K/Akt pathway.",

Anthocyanins are a class of flavonoids, widely distributed in food, exhibiting important biological effects. Cyanidin chloride (CyCl) is the common type of anthocyanin with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory potential. The present study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the chemotherapeutic effects of CyCl in colorectal cancer cells. We found that CyCl treatment induced apoptosis as well as a significant inhibition of cellular proliferation and colony formation in three colon cancer HCT116, HT29, and SW620 cells. In addition, CyCl suppressed nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling and induced the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-stimulated colon cancer cells. Nrf2 and NF-κB are two key transcription factors regulating antioxidative responses and cellular proliferation, respectively. In this study, knockdown of Nrf2 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection inhibited the effect of CyCl on NF-κB signaling and apoptosis, suggesting that there is functional crosstalk between Nrf2 and NF-κB. Our findings demonstrate the important role of Nrf2 in inducing apoptosis through the involvement of NF-κB signaling in colorectal cancer cells, suggesting that CyCl may be used as a potential therapeutic agent for CRC."
