      "abstract": "Butterfly pea flower (Clitoria ternatea) may serve as an alternative anti-dandruff treatment; however, its effects on Malassezia spp. remain unexplored. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of C. ternatea as an herbal-based anti-dandruff treatment on Malassezia spp. DNA expression, plakoglobin levels, IL-8 levels, sebum levels, dandruff severity scores, adverse effects, and patient satisfaction. An experimental study with a pretest-posttest control design was conducted at the Outpatient Clinic of Dermatology and Venereology, Arifin Achmad Hospital, Pekanbaru, Indonesia, from November 2023 to January 2024. The flower of C. ternatea was used to formulate the shampoo. The study involved 70 female patients aged 18-25 with dandruff, who were divided into two groups: (a) experimental group using 20% C. ternatea shampoo and (b) control group using 2% ketoconazole shampoo. The present study found that 2% ketoconazole shampoo significantly reduced Malassezia spp. DNA expression compared to 20% C. ternatea shampooo (Clitoria ternatea: ΔCq=1.76±3.18; ketoconazole: ΔCq=3.77±2.90; p=0.008). No significant difference was observed in plakoglobin levels (C. ternatea: ΔCq=1.98±3.63; ketoconazole: ΔCq=2.50±2.36; p=0.427) or IL-8 levels (C. ternatea: ΔCq=3.46±4.00; ketoconazole: ΔCq=4.16 ± 3.62; p=0.459). C. ternatea significantly reduced sebum levels more than ketoconazole (C. ternatea: 1.16±0.98%; ketoconazole: 0.22±0.38%; p<0.001). Dandruff scores and patient satisfaction were similar for both shampoos (p=0.115 and p=0.336, respectively). Adverse effects were more common in the 2% ketoconazole shampoo group, affecting 21.2% of the patients. In conclusion, 2% ketoconazole shampoo is more effective in reducing Malassezia spp. DNA expression, while 20% C. ternatea shampoo offers better sebum control. Both shampoos are similarly effective in ameliorating dandruff severity and are well-tolerated, with fewer adverse effects reported for C. ternatea.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a long-term condition marked by high blood glucose levels caused by insulin resistance which will lead to complications of other diseases such as dyslipidemia, which also affects the health of the liver and kidneys. Butterfly pea flower (Clitorea ternatea L.) has phenolic and flavonoid compounds which have the potential as herbal medicines for antidiabetics. AIM: The purpose of this study is to examine the potential of butterfly pea flower extract (BPE) as an antidiabetic, anti-dyslipidemia, and renoprotection. METHODS: In vivo test was performed on Sprague Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus L.) induced by Streptozotocin-Nicotinamide and High Fat Diet-Propylthiouracil as models of DM and dyslipidemia, and BPE was administered orally (200, 400, and 800 mg/kg BW) for 28 days. glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione S-transferase (GST), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-kB), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), liver albumin levels, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, and serum uric acid (UA), were measured by ELISA and colorimetry methods. RESULTS: Treatment of BPE 800 mg/kg BW increased levels of GSH-Px, GST, albumin, and serum protein. BPE decreased TNF-α, NF-kB, and ALP. BPE also decreased BUN, serum CR, and serum UA. CONCLUSION: BPE has the potential to be used as a drug alternative for the treatment of DM and dyslipidemia as well as a hepatoprotective and renoprotective agent.",

      "abstract": "Sixteen 35-day-old male crossbred rabbits (New Zealand white × Thai native breed) with an initial weight of 484 ± 11.3 g were randomly divided into two groups of eight, constituting control and treatment groups. The treatment group was orally administered a crude extract of butterfly pea (Clitoria ternatea L.) at 0.5 g/kg body weight from weaning (at 35 days) to slaughter (at 90 days). The effects on the phagocytic activity of blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes, serum biochemistry, meat quality, muscular lipid peroxidation, the apparent digestibility of dry matter and nutrients, and gut histology were studied. The results revealed that the phagocytic function of circulating leukocytes (75 and 90 days) and alveolar macrophages (90 days) did not differ between the two groups. At slaughter, treated rabbits had lower blood urea nitrogen concentrations and higher liver weight than control rabbits (p < 0.05). After chilling at 4 °C for 24 h, a lower meat pH and the alteration of meat color (brighter, less yellow, lower hue angle, and decreased color saturation) were observed in the treated group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, lipid peroxidation (measured at 3, 5, and 7 storage days) in the meat of treated rabbits was lower than in controls (p < 0.05). The apparent digestibility of organic matter and ether extract (analyzed at 46 days for 4 days) was improved in the treated group (p < 0.05), whereas gut histology was unaffected. In conclusion, butterfly pea extract supplementation did not affect phagocytic function but led to a modification in meat color, delayed lipid peroxidation, and improved digestibility."

      "abstract": "Clitoria ternatea, with an alternative name, Butterfly pea, is increasingly being explored for medical purposes and the development of a wide range of processed products. This study aimed to incorporate Butterfly pea into an innovative probiotic drink through a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY) fermentation and to evaluate the biological activity. The benefits of the drink, referred to as butterfly pea flower kombucha (KBPF) was determined in vitro and in metabolically disorder mice that receive a diet rich in cholesterol and fat (CFED). Forty white male were categorized into four groups, i.e., A = Control/Normal Diet; B = CFED alone; C = CFED + KBPF 65 mg/kg BW (Body Weight); D = CFED + KBPF 130 mg/kg BW, and then sacrificed after 6 weeks of intervention. Seventy-nine secondary metabolite compounds were successfully identified in KBPF using LC-HRMS. In vitro studies showed the potential activity of KBPF in inhibiting not only ABTS, but also lipid (lipase) and carbohydrate (α-amylase, α-glucosidase) hydrolyzing enzymes to levels similar to acarbose control at 50-250 μg/mL. In the in vivo study, the administration of KBPF (130 mg/kg BW) significantly alleviated metabolic disorders caused by high-fat diet. Specifically, lipid profile (HDL, LDL, TC, TG), blood glucose, markers of oxidative stress (SOD liver), metabolic enzymes (lipase, amylase), and markers of inflammation (PGC-1α, TNF-α, and IL-10) were in most cases restored to normal values. Additionally, the gut microbiota community analysis showed that KBPF has a positive effect (p = 0.01) on both the Bacteroidetes phylum and the Firmicutes phylum. The new KBPF drink is a promising therapeutic functional food for preventing metabolic diseases."

      "abstract": "In this study, we examine whether Clitoria ternatea Linn. (CT) can prevent Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME)-induced cardiac and vascular dysfunction in rats. Male Sprague Dawley rats were given L-NAME (40 mg/kg, drinking water) and orally administered with CT extract (300 mg/kg/day) or lisinopril (2.5 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks. The main phytochemical components of the CT extract were found to be flavonoids. The CT extract alleviated the high blood pressure in rats receiving L-NAME. Decreased vasorelaxation responses to acetylcholine and enhanced contractile responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation in aortic rings and mesenteric vascular beds of L-NAME treated rats were ameliorated by CT extract supplementation. Left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction were developed in L-NAME rats, which were partially prevented by CT extract treatment. The CT extract alleviated upregulated endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression, decreased plasma nitrate/nitrite levels, and increased oxidative stress in L-NAME rats. It suppressed high levels of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, plasma angiotensin II, and cardiac angiotensin II type 1 receptor, NADPH oxidases 2, nuclear factor-kappa B, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression. The CT extract, therefore, partially prevented L-NAME-induced hypertension and cardiovascular alterations in rats. These effects might be related to a reduction in the oxidative stress and renin-angiotensin system activation due to L-NAME in rats."
