      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A major challenge in cancer treatment is the detrimental effects of anticancer drugs on healthy organs and tissues. This study aims to investigate the protective effects of Lutein (LU) against Cisplatin (CT)-induced toxicity in rat liver, utilizing biochemical and histopathological assessments. METHODS: In this study, CT was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a dose of 10 mg/kg, while LU was administered orally at a dose of 100 mg/kg. The experiment was conducted over a 7-day period with 28 male Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 210-265 g, aged 11 weeks), divided into four groups (n = 7): Control, LU, CT, and CT + LU. RESULTS: CT-induced liver injury was identified as a dose-limiting side effect of CT. Compared to the CT group, the CT + LU group exhibited a significant decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and an increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH) levels. In the CT group, a significant increase in the levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was observed, compared to the control group (p < 0.05). When comparing the CT + LU group with the CT group, a significant reduction in the levels of GGT, ALT, AST, and LDH was observed (p < 0.05). Histopathological analysis revealed liver damage in the CT group, characterized by leukocyte infiltration, sinusoidal dilatation, Councilman body formation, and hepatocellular degeneration and steatosis. In contrast, the CT + LU group exhibited only mild sinusoidal dilatation, with no other significant lesions. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive staining for tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and caspase-3 in the liver tissue of CT group rats, which was significantly reduced in the CT + LU group. The staining pattern in the CT + LU group was similar to that of the control and LU groups. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that LU mitigates oxidative stress, enhances antioxidant defences, and supports liver function. Furthermore, LU demonstrates a protective effect against CT-induced liver damage, indicating its potential as a pharmacological agent for preventing CT-induced hepatic injury."

      "abstract": "Considering that woman's health during pregnancy is crucial to well-being as much maternal and fetal as well as the child's future, supplementation with antioxidant compounds has emerged as a promising strategy to prevent the development of future diseases. Given this context, the study aimed to evaluate the effect of lutein carrier nanoparticles supplementation during the preconception period on the offspring of Drosophila melanogaster subjected to a neurodevelopmental disorder model. Female flies, were exposed to either a standard diet or a diet containing NPs LUT (6 μM) for 24 h. Following this period, the flies were transferred to new experimental vials, and eighteen males were added, resulting in a total of 53 flies per experimental group. The male and female flies were then subdivided into two groups and exposed to either a standard diet or imidacloprid (IMI), for 7 days, to induce the neurodevelopmental disorder model, creating four experimental groups: 1) Control; 2) IMI; 3) NPs LUT; 4) NPs LUT + IMI. The hatched offspring were then used for behavioral and biochemical evaluations. Our results showed that supplementation with lutein carrier nanoparticles was able to prevent decreased activity of enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), as did neurotransmitters dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) in the head of flies, and as a consequence it prevented behavioral damages such as hyperactivity, anxiety, social interaction, repetitive movements, learning and memory in the progeny of both sexes. Thus, these findings highlight the relevance of preconception supplementation with lutein carrier nanoparticles as an effective approach to prevent the emergence of symptoms associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, paving the way for future research aimed at investigating the best intervention period to prevent ASD and ADHD-type disorders.",

      "abstract": "Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a mycotoxin commonly present in feed, has several toxic effects. AFB1 seems to have a neurotoxic effect that leads to neurobehavioral impairment. On the other hand, Lutein and Zeaxanthin (LUT/ZEA) have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Here, we aimed to compare the effects of AFB1 and the co-treatment with LUT/ZEA on neurobehavioural and biochemical changes viz-a-viz oxido-inflammatory response in male rats' hippocampal and pre-frontal cortexes. Experimental rats of the Wistar strain (n = 40) were randomly grouped into treatment cohorts: Control (corn oil 2 mL/kg), AFB1 (75 μg/kg), LUT/ZEA only (100 mg/kg), AFB1 + LUT/ZEA (75 μg/kg + 100 mg/kg), and AFB1 + LUT/ZEA (75 μg/kg + 200 mg/kg). All groups were administered their respective treatment orally for 28 days, while behavioural tests were conducted using open field tests (OFT), Y-maze, novel object tests (NORT), and forced swim tests (FST) 1 h after treatment on day 26-28. The animals were euthanized on day 29. In the hippocampal and pre-frontal cortex, antioxidant indicators (SOD, CAT, GSH, GST, GPx, TSH), inflammatory mediators (XO, NO, MPO), and acetylcholinesterase activity were measured. Our finding presents the anti-oxidant effect of lutein/Zeaxanthin in the brains of AFB1-intoxicated rats, indicating better cognitive and spatial memory capacity in Y-maze and NORT, an improvement in locomotive and explorative behaviour in OFT and reduction in anxio-depressive-like behaviour in LUT/ZEA co-treated rats. Acetylcholinesterase activity was enhanced in LUT/ZEA co-treated rats. LUT/ZEA co-treatment dampened oxido-inflammatory mediators by decreasing XO, NO, and MPO levels and increasing antioxidant activities (SOD, CAT, GSH, GST, GPx, TSH) in the prefrontal and hippocampal cortices. We surmise that mechanistically, co-treatment with LUT/ZEA effectively lessened AFB1 neurotoxicity through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant pathways and essentially improved the experimental rats' neurobehavioural outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Macular pigment (MP), consisting of lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z), is believed to provide retinal protection against photo-oxidative damage. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of lutein and zeaxanthin complex 5:1 (extracted from marigold flowers) supplementation on macular pigment optical density (MPOD), contrast sensitivity, and quality of sleep in healthy subjects who exposed themselves to an electronic gadget screen for a minimum of 8 hours every day. This study also aimed to assess the long-term safety of the supplement by administering it for 8 months in one of the groups. The study also assessed the retention effects of lutein and zeaxanthin on MPOD after discontinuation of supplementation. Methods The study was registered with the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI/2022/12/048392). Subjects were screened as per the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects aged 18-55 years with a screen time of at least 8 hours daily and MPOD values below 0.8 were recruited. The study, conducted at Narayana Nethralaya Super Specialty Eye Hospital, Bangalore, spanned from December 2022 to May 2024. This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Of the 96 volunteers screened for this study, 71 were recruited, and 60 completed the study. Subjects were divided into 3 groups, viz. A, B, and C. Group A received lutein 10mg and zeaxanthin 2mg twice daily for the first four months, had a wash-off period of 15 days, and continued with the same supplementation for the remaining four months. Group B received lutein 10mg and zeaxanthin 2mg twice daily for the first four months, had a wash-off period of 15 days, and then switched over to a placebo for the next four months. Group C received a Placebo for the first 4 months, had a wash-off period of 15 days, and then switched over to lutein 10mg and zeaxanthin 2mg for the next four months. All the subjects were given either, lutein and zeaxanthin complex-5:1 or placebo capsules as per the randomization chart prepared computationally. Subjects were analyzed for their MPOD values, contrast sensitivity scores, and quality of sleep. Intraocular pressure, retinal thickness, renal function tests, and liver function tests were conducted during visits to ensure clinical safety. Results After supplementation with the lutein-zeaxanthin complex-5:1, the average MPOD (at 1ᴏ eccentricity) increased significantly. At the first visit, the mean MPOD for Groups A, B, and C were 0.3, 0.22, and 0.29 (right eye) and 0.31, 0.27, and 0.27 (left eye), respectively. At the second visit, these values were 0.61, 0.66, and 0.21 (right eye) and 0.54, 0.53, and 0.2 (left eye). By the third visit, the mean MPOD values were 0.7, 0.65, and 0.38 (right eye) and 0.66, 0.53, and 0.36 (left eye). Supplementation significantly improved MPOD, contrast sensitivity, and the quality of sleep compared to placebo.  Conclusions The supplementation with lutein and zeaxanthin resulted in higher MPOD values as compared to that of the placebo. This intervention also led to improvement in contrast sensitivity and quality of sleep. Lutein and zeaxanthin complex-5:1 may be a promising remedial measure for increasing the MPOD of people exposed to prolonged screen time."

This review explores the effects of lutein supplementation on DED symptoms and signs. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, examining clinical trials from databases including PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 584 subjects were included. Meta-analysis was not conducted due to heterogeneity in study designs, dosages, and outcome measures. RESULTS: Lutein dosages ranged from 3 mg/day to 20 mg/day, with treatment durations from 4 to 12 weeks. Improvements were observed in subjective symptoms, with significant reductions in Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores in some studies. Objective measures also showed positive results: tear break-up time (TBUT) increased significantly in some trials. However, other studies reported no significant differences between treatment and control groups, reflecting heterogeneity in outcomes. Schirmer's test and corneal-conjunctival staining results varied, with some showing significant improvements and others not. CONCLUSIONS: Lutein supplementation may benefit DED patients by improving symptoms and tear film stability. However, due to study heterogeneity, larger, well-designed RCTs are needed to establish standardized dosing and confirm these findings.",

      "abstract": "Lutein is a natural pigment with various beneficial biological activities, but its poor water solubility, chemical instability, and low bioavailability limit its application in food processing. In this study, modified casein (CAS-OCS NPs)-based Pickering emulsions were constructed under the combined effect of TGase-type glycation and ultrasound treatment as delivery systems for lutein fortification. Pickering emulsions based on CAS-OCS NPs enhanced the encapsulation efficiency of lutein (87.04 ± 0.30 %). The modification treatments improved the emulsifying properties, environmental stability, and digestive stability, as well as the delivery capability of lutein and antioxidant activity in simulated in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. After glycation modification, the lutein release rate of CAS-OCS NPs-based Pickering emulsions after in vitro digestion was higher than that of untreated casein-based Pickering emulsions, and the maximum release rate was 55.44 ± 0.50 %. Moreover, the CAS-OCS NPs-based Pickering emulsions showed improved lutein bioaccessibility, reaching the maximum value of 58.52 ± 0.52 %. These findings demonstrated the suitability of TGase-type glycation and ultrasound treatment for the preparation of Pickering emulsions to deliver bioactive compounds."

      "abstract": "Central obesity poses a significant health threat. Lutein-rich fruits and vegetables may help manage obesity. Limited evidence suggests that lutein exerts health effects by inhibiting advanced glycation end products (AGEs), but data on its effects in centrally obese individuals are sparse. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of lutein supplementation in subjects with central obesity. A double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted involving patients with central obesity. Anthropometric indices, dietary intake, metabolic parameters, carotenoid and AGEs levels were compared between those receiving a 32-week intervention of 10 mg d-1 lutein and a placebo group. There were 117 patients randomly assigned in the analysis. Twenty-three patients were lost to follow-up. Both intention-to-treat analysis and the per-protocol analysis showed significant reductions in plasma total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and malonaldehyde levels in the lutein supplementation group compared with the placebo group. Significant differences were also observed between the groups in plasma lutein, carboxyethyl lysine (CEL), carboxymethyl lysine (CML), methylglyoxal hydroimidazolone (MG-HI) levels and skin carotenoid index (all P < 0.05). The mean difference and 95% confidence interval were 0.12 [0.08 to 0.16] μg ml-1, -8.76 [-16.60 to -0.89] ng ml-1, -72.3 [-134.0 to -10.9] ng ml-1, -233.9 [-429.0 to -36.8] ng ml-1 and 0.94 [0.56 to 1.31] a.u., respectively. Furthermore, changes in plasma lutein concentration were positively correlated with changes in the skin carotenoid index (r = 0.41, P < 0.001), and negatively correlated with changes in plasma CEL (r = -0.24, P = 0.018), (CML) (r = -0.21, P = 0.051, and MG-H1) (r = -0.25, P = 0.017). In conclusion, regular lutein intake can improve metabolic health in adults with central obesity by increasing plasma lutein concentrations, reducing oxidative stress, lowering plasma TC, LDL-C, and ApoB levels, and downregulating AGEs.",

LUT-LRSNPs were prepared via the antisolvent nanoprecipitation method and characterized by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and iodine complexation. The result confirmed that lutein was successfully encapsulated in LRSNPs with an encapsulation efficiency up to 84.6 %. Lutein combined with LRSNPs through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction to form a stable composite, which enhanced the photothermal stability of lutein and realized its controlled release. The cumulative release of lutein in simulated intestinal fluid reached 86.5 %. An inflammatory model was established by stimulating Caco-2 cells with lipopolysaccharide. LUT-LRSNPs significantly decreased the intensity of ROS, inhibited the secretion of TLR4 and the phosphorylation of p38, thus reducing the activation of the NF-κB pathway. It also reduced NO content, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α secretion, as well as the corresponding mRNA expressions in a concentration-dependent manner, with the effect significantly superior to lutein. The prevention group generally exhibited better inhibitory effect than that of the treatment group. In conclusion, LUT-LRSNPs emphasized the enhanced anti-inflammatory effects of lutein and could constitute an alternative for preventing or alleviating related inflammations.",

This information led us to investigate the effectiveness of lutein (LT), which has antioxidant effects, in preventing CS-induced cardiotoxic effects. After 28 rats were randomly divided into four equal groups, saline (1 ml/day) was administered to the control group, LT (100 mg/kg/day) to the LT group, CS (10 mg/kg) to the CS group, and active agents in the LT and CS groups were administered to the CS + LT group in the same dose and manner. The examinations determined that MDA, cardiac biomarkers (CK-MB, BNP, LDH, and cTn-I) levels, TNF-α and caspase-3 expressions, and apoptosis significantly increased in the CS group. In contrast, GSH, SOD, and CAT levels were decreased. In addition, histopathological changes characterized by interstitial edema, leukocyte infiltration, and vacuolar degeneration were detected in the heart tissues of this group. It was determined that LT application prevented the above-mentioned CS-induced cardiotoxic effects to a significant extent, although not completely. The findings obtained in this study show that LT may reduce CS-induced cardiac damage thanks to its ROS-reducing, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and cytoprotective characteristics.",

METHODS: Participants took 6 mg of lutein and 1 mg of zeaxanthin, along with 100 mg elderberry extract once daily for a duration of 20 days. Ocular health was assessed using the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), while immune status was evaluated with the Immune Status Questionnaire (ISQ). RESULTS: Results showed that combined supplementation significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the OSDI scores in the intervention group from 38.15 ± 11.14 to 18.26 ± 5.57, reflecting a 52.2% reduction. A similar trend was observed with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), indicating significant (p < 0.05) improvement from 5.31 ± 1.62 to 6.73 ± 1.74, equivalent to a 26.7% improvement. Although the intervention group showed a 15.9% improvement in ISQ scores by the study's end, this was not significantly different from the placebo group, suggesting that higher dosages or longer durations may be needed to observe a meaningful effect. Additionally, findings from the Food Frequency Questionnaire revealed that the average dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin among participants was only 663.49 µg, equating to just 5.5% of the suggested optimal daily intake. This low consumption is concerning, as it is inversely correlated with the risk of ocular diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings support the use of combined supplementation as an adjuvant approach to improving ocular health.",

Recently, we found that lutein has dual roles in suppressing bone resorption and promoting bone formation. In this study, we examined the effects of lutein in a disuse-induced osteoporosis model using hindlimb-unloaded (HLU) mice. METHODS: Osteoclast differentiation was assessed by coculturing mouse primary osteoblasts and bone marrow cells or culturing a mouse osteoclast precursor cell line. The bone-resorbing activity was determined by mouse calvarial organ cultures. An in situ docking simulation was conducted to reveal the interaction of lutein and IκB kinase (IKK) β protein. HLU mice were fed a 1% lutein-containing diet for two weeks, and the femoral bone mass was measured by μCT. RESULTS: Osteoclast differentiation is significantly inhibited by lutein, astaxanthin, and β-cryptoxanthin. In contrast, only lutein promoted osteoblastic calcified bone nodule formation. To elucidate the molecular role of lutein, we functionally analyzed the NF-κB complex, a molecule involved in bone metabolism, especially in osteoclasts. Docking simulations showed that lutein binds to IKK, thus inhibiting the activation of NF-κB. In a cell culture analysis, the phosphorylation of p65, the active form of NF-κB in osteoblasts, was suppressed by lutein treatment. In vivo, a μCT analysis of the bone microarchitecture showed that lutein improves several bone parameters while maintaining bone mass. CONCLUSIONS: Lutein is effective in maintaining bone mass by controlling both bone resorption and formation, which is applied to prevent disuse-induced osteoporosis.",

Herein, the anticancer effects against A549 NSCLC cells and hyaluronidase inhibitory activity of the ethanol extract of Xenostegia tridentata (L.) D.F. Austin & Staples and its subfractions were investigated. In correlation with their hyaluronidase inhibition, the hexane subfraction exhibited the most potent cytotoxicity, and the ethyl acetate subfraction could significantly inhibit the cancer cell migration. The hexane and ethyl acetate fractions were then further isolated to identify the active compounds responsible for the anticancer and hyaluronidase inhibitory activities. Among the 10 isolated compounds, lutein (5), a previously reported anti-lung cancer agent, showed the strongest inhibition on hyaluronidase enzyme activity. Its anticancer activities were validated. Notably, in addition to demonstrating the potential of X. tridentata extract for NSCLC treatment, this study discloses that hyaluronidase is a potential target for the anticancer activities of lutein. The cellular mechanisms underlying the hyaluronidase inhibitory activity of X. tridentata extract need to be further explored to fully understand how this inhibition contributes to its anti-cancer effects.",

Lutein, a xanthophyll carotenoid, has well-known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In this experiment, we aimed to investigate the neuroprotective and remyelination potential of lutein in comparison with dimethyl fumarate (DMF) as a reference drug in post-cuprizone-intoxicated C57BL/6 mice. Lutein (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day; p.o.) and DMF (15 mg/kg/day, i.p.) were administered either alone or in combination for three weeks at the end of the six-week cuprizone (0.2 % w/w) feeding period. At the end of the study, behavioral tests, histopathological staining, immunohistochemistry (olig2), ELISA, and real-time PCR were performed to evaluate the target parameters. Lutein treatment significantly enhanced motor functions, reversed cuprizone-induced demyelination and increased serum TAC. In addition, treatment with lutein increased the number of Olig2+ cells in the corpus callosum, reduced the IL-1β and TNF-α and increased BDNF. Lutein administration significantly increased the expression levels of genes involved in myelin production (MBP, PLP, MOG, MAG, and OLIG-1) and notably reduced GFAP expression levels. In the present study, our results showed that lutein treatment could promote remyelination and neuroprotective effects by reducing neuroinflammation and upregulating the expression of the genes involved in myelin formation These findings suggest that lutein could serve as a potential adjuvant therapy for patients with multiple sclerosis. Further clinical trials are necessary to confirm its efficacy."

The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) plays a pivotal role in steroidogenesis, but the impact of APAP on StAR expression in adult human ovarian granulosa cells remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that APAP overdose leads to the downregulation of StAR expression in the human granulosa cell tumor cell line, KGN, and in the primary culture of human granulosa-lutein (hGL) cells. Treatment of overdose APAP inhibits the activation of the AKT signaling pathway and downregulates the expression of transcription factor SP1. Using a small molecule of AKT activator and SP1 overexpression approaches, we show that the suppressive effect of APAP on StAR expression is mediated through the inhibition of AKT-mediated upregulation of SP1 expression. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the pharmacological actions of APAP and its impacts on female reproductive health.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MI/RI) is associated with increased oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in an elevated risk of mortality. MI/RI may be alleviated by protecting cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress. Lutein, which belongs to a class of carotenoids, has proven to be effective in cardiovascular disease treatment due to its remarkable antioxidant properties, but its application is limited due to its poor stability and low bioavailability in vivo. METHODS: In this study, a delivery system was developed based on distearoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine (DSPE)-thiol-ketone (TK)-PEG2K (polyethylene glycol 2000) (abbreviated as DTP) and PCM-SH (CWLSEAGPVVTVRALRGTGSW) to deliver lutein (abbreviated as lutein@DTPP) to damaged myocardium. First, lutein, lutein@DTP, or lutein@DTPP were injected through the tail vein once a day for 3 days and then MI/RI model rats were established by exposing rats to ischemia for 45 min and reperfusion for 6 h. We employed a range of experimental techniques including qRT-PCR, Western blotting, transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. RESULTS: Lutein@DTPP exhibited good myocardial targeting and ROS-responsive release. Our data suggested that lutein@DTPP effectively suppresses ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, we observed an upregulation of mouse double minute-2 (MDM2) in the hearts of MI/RI models and cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) conditions. In addition, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa Fe-S protein 1 (NDUFS1) translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria was inhibited by MDM2 upregulation. Notably, no significant variation in the total NDUFS1 expression was observed in H/R-exposed cardiomyocytes following treatment with siMDM2. Further study indicated that lutein facilitates the translocation of NDUFS1 from the cytosol to mitochondria by directly binding and sequestering MDM2, thereby improving mitochondrial function and inhibiting ferroptosis. CONCLUSION: Lutein@DTPP promoted the mitochondrial translocation of NDUFS1 to restore mitochondrial function and inhibited the ferroptosis of cardiomyocytes by directly binding and sequestering MDM2.",

In our study, lutein (L) (100 mg/kg, orally) was administered for brain toxicity caused by CS (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.)). The study was completed in 7 days with a total of 28 rats from 4 groups, each consisting of 7 subjects. Control, L, CS and CS + L. A decrease in MDA level and an increase in CAT, GSH and SOD levels were observed in the CS + L group compared to the CS group. In histopathological examinations, no significant pathological changes were detected in the cerebrum, while degeneration in Purkinje cells and apoptosis in neurons in the molecular and granular layers in the cerebellum were detected. It is understood from the study that L alleviates the results of oxidative stress, increases antioxidant functions and positively supports brain functions. It also demonstrates the ability of L to prevent CS-induced brain damage. Ultimately, L appears to be a applicable pharmacological agent in this damage.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of blindness in infants, affecting 32% of hospitalized preterm infants. Oxidative stress, a primary pathogenic factor in ROP, triggers abnormal neovascularization of retinal vessels. Lutein, an antioxidant and the main component of macular pigment, is found in low levels in preterm infants and may help ameliorate ROP. However, its low bioavailability limits its application as a nutritional intervention. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to assess the effect of a lutein emulsion stabilized by a food-grade biopolymer on lutein bioavailability in neonatal rats with ROP and examine the effects of both unemulsified lutein and lutein emulsion on the disease. METHODS: Neonatal rats were subcutaneously administered KRN 633 (10 mg/kg body weight) on postnatal days 7 and 8 (P7 and P8) to induce ROP. Neonatal rats that did not receive the treatment served as the control. From P9 to P21, both ROP and non-ROP rats were divided into 3 groups and given daily doses of olive oil, unemulsified lutein (2 mg/kg body weight lutein), or lutein emulsion (2 mg/kg body weight lutein). On P22, serum and tissues were collected. Lutein concentrations were measured using ultra-performance liquid chromatography, and retinal morphology was assessed using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Rats treated with lutein emulsion had significantly higher serum and tissue lutein concentrations than those receiving unemulsified lutein. Morphological assessments showed that ROP rats had more tortuous arteries, increased capillary density, enlarged vessels, reduced astrocyte density, and decreased neuronal cells. Both unemulsified lutein and lutein emulsion alleviated these abnormalities, with lutein emulsion showing superior efficacy in restoring neuronal cell levels to normal in the peripheral retina. CONCLUSIONS: Lutein, in both unemulsified and emulsified forms, effectively inhibited ROP progression in neonatal rats. The biopolymer-based lutein emulsion showed promise as a delivery system to enhance lutein bioavailability and mitigate ROP in preterm infants.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Growing evidence emphasizes the importance of xanthophyll carotenoids and omega-3 fatty acids in eye health. However, the beneficial effects of such supplementation have not been thoroughly discussed among adults with high screen exposure. Current trial evidence on lutein bioavailability is contradictory, and the interactions of dietary intervention with host-related factors remain elusive. This study aims to investigate the comparative effectiveness of supplementation with macular xanthophylls and omega-3 fatty acids on macular pigment optical density (MPOD) and visual function, access the bioavailability of free lutein and lutein ester, and explore the complex interplay between genetic variations, intestinal microbiota, and the dietary intervention in Chinese adults with long-term exposure to digital devices. METHODS: The Lutein, Zeaxanthin, and Omega-3 (LZO) clinical trial is a 24-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 600 participants recruited from research centers, universities, and communities. Individuals are eligible to participate if they are aged over 18 years and use digital devices for over 8 h daily in the last 2 years, and will be randomized to six arms. A total of three visits will be scheduled at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks. The primary outcome is the change in MPOD over the 24-week intervention. The secondary outcomes are changes in visual function (visual acuity, best-corrected visual acuity, contrast and glare sensitivity, critical flicker fusion, reaction time, visuognosis persistence, symptoms and signs of dry eye, retinal thickness, and optical quality), and changes in serum lutein and zeaxanthin concentrations, and erythrocyte membrane omega-3 fatty acids. Genetic variations will be determined using genome-wide genotyping at baseline. 16S rRNA gene sequencing will be utilized to assess microbiome compositional changes before and after intervention. DISCUSSION: The trial is anticipated to establish early interventions to prevent photochemical ocular damage and delay the onset of vision impairment in young adults with long-term repeated exposure to screen-based electronic devices, and provide valuable insights for the development of precision nutrition strategies for maintaining eye health.

      "abstract": "Since the recycling of composites from plant tissues is difficult, extraction of bioactive compounds from plant sources requires pre-treatment by new technology such as pulsed electric fields (PEF). Due to the reduced consumption of organic solvents, the extractive techniques such as using supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) are of interest to researchers. This work aimed to investigating the influences of different parameters of SC-CO2 (pressure, modifier volume, temperature, and dynamic time) and PEF (frequency and field strength) treatments on the amount extraction of β-carotene, lycopene, lutein, β-cryptoxanthin, total phenol content (TPC), and also antioxidant activity percentage of tomato to obtain the optimum circumstances extraction via PEF and SC-CO2 methods. PEF data showed that treatments with moderate intensity (1 Hz and 0. 25 kV/cm) enhanced the extractability of lycopene (88%), β-carotene (69%), and β-cryptoxanthin (24%). The maximum recovery in total polyphenols was achieved at a 1 Hz and 1.75 kV/cm, leading to a 41.68% growth. The SC-CO2 results showed that extraction at 55°C and 35 MPa, and in a short time of 20 min (without any modifier: methanol) resulted in the highest levels of carotenoids (100% recovery), especially lycopene, and antioxidant activity. Largest value of total polyphenols was obtained at 35 MPa, 35°C, during 30 min, and 250 μL methanol as a modifier (58.79% recovery). Results showed that the extraction of polyphenols, unlike carotenoids, required a modifier. Organic solvents, often called modifiers, are sometimes added to the supercritical fluid to increase the polarity range of the extraction process and to help overcome analyte retention in the matrix. In this study, methanol was used as a modifier in different volumes. Therefore, the SC-CO2 gentle processing conditions, compared with PEF, improved the recovery of tomato bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to optimize such treatments."

      "abstract": "With the increasing prevalence of electronic devices, awareness of the risks linked to blue light exposure has significantly heightened. Lutein, a powerful antioxidant, safeguards eye tissue by filtering blue light, while supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) enhances retinal function. Adequate intake of these nutrients can help reduce the potential damage from prolonged blue light exposure. The protective effects of lutein and algal oil stabilized with Pickering emulsion were investigated using casein-dextran (CD) conjugates via Maillard reaction. Microstructural analysis revealed a three-dimensional network structure surrounding oil droplets formed by CD conjugates. With the increase of the oil phase ratio from 55 % to 80 %, the average size of Pickering emulsion droplets decreased. Pickering emulsion demonstrated higher viscoelasticity, excellent recovery, thixotropy, and good thermal stability as the oil phase ratio increased. The retention of lutein in CD-75 % Pickering emulsions showed significant improvement under various conditions. Simulated gastrointestinal digestion demonstrated that CD-75 % Pickering emulsions effectively enhanced the lutein bioaccessibility from 19.97 % to 48.99 %. In vivo experiments showed that lutein-loaded Pickering emulsion could effectively relieve blue light-induced retinal degeneration in mice. These findings suggested that Pickering emulsion can serve as a delivery system to protect lutein, offering a nutritional intervention to mitigate blue light-induced retinal degeneration.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Neurodegenerative diseases are defined by specific protein accumulation and anatomic vulnerability leading to neuronal loss. Some studies have shown that lutein may have an effect on neurodegenerative diseases. As most of the neurodegenerative diseases don't have certain cure and therapies focus on symptom control, Lutein may be a complementary treatment. Due to controversies in studies investigating lutein effect on neurodegenerative diseases, we decided to perform a systematic review on these studies. METHODS: A systematic search was carried out in the available databases. We used all MeSH terms and relevant keywords. Studies that reported relationship between lutein and any neurodegenerative disease were included. RESULTS: We found 278 studies. After removing duplicates, screening by titles and abstracts and excluding irrelevant papers, 17 articles were included in this study. Fourteen studies investigated Alzheimer's disease, 2 studies Parkinson's disease and 1 study Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 1/17 study found that high serum levels of lutein at baseline were associated with a lower risk of AD mortality and lutein effect on lipid profile have been investigated in 2/17 studies. Also, 1/17 study has been shown that high intake of lutein may reduce the risk of ALS progression. CONCLUSIONS: 4/17 studies confirm that lutein can improve cognitive function. 8/17 studies demonstrate a reduction in the progression of AD, and 2/17 studies indicate an improvement in lipid profiles. However, some studies did not find any significant associations. Additionally, there is a limited number of studies investigating the effects of lutein on other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Alkaline electrolyzed water (AEW), with its reduced-state and small molecular clusters, effectively extracted bioactive substances and inhibited oxidation. Thus, an AEW-assisted ultrasonic extraction method was used to extract lutein from daylily. Compared to ultrasonic extraction alone, AEW treatment increased the lutein yield by 60 %. Structural analysis confirmed the preservation of all-trans lutein by AEW. Assess AEW extraction's impact on lutein's bioactivity by examining its protection against blue light cell damage. The results showed that that lutein extracted using AEW exhibited enhanced antioxidant capacity, significantly boosting the viability of ARPE-19 cells and the activity of intracellular antioxidant enzymes, thereby mitigating oxidative stress damage to the retina caused by blue light exposure. This study provided an effective method for efficiently extracting bioactive substances and preventing the impact of the extraction process on their structure and function.",

RECENT FINDINGS: Lutein and zeaxanthin are phytochemical compounds in the carotenoid group and are synthesised only by plants. All mammals get lutein and zeaxanthin into their bodies by consuming plant-based foods. Especially leafy green vegetables, broccoli, pumpkin, cabbage, spinach and egg yolk are rich in lutein and zeaxanthin. Lutein and zeaxanthin have potential health effects by preventing free radical formation, exhibiting protective properties against oxidative damage and reducing oxidative stress. These compounds have neuroprotective, cardioprotective, ophthalmological, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-osteoporosis, anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, and antimicrobial effects. The preventive properties of lutein and zeaxanthin against numerous diseases have attracted attention recently. Further clinical trials with large samples are needed to make generalisations in the prevention and treatment of diseases and to determine the appropriate doses and forms of lutein and zeaxanthin.",

      "abstract": "Intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD) is a spectrum of liver diseases occurring in patients not exposed to liver-damaging factors other than those linked to intestinal dysfunction. The pathogenesis of this disease is multifactorial. It is estimated that up to 90 % of people taking long-term parenteral nutrition may develop IFALD, with particular risk for premature neonates and infants due to their immature antioxidant protection and bile acid metabolism. The lack of effective prevention and treatment methods for IFALD encourages scientists to search for new therapeutic solutions. The use of lutein as a substance with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects seems to be of great potential in such indication, especially since patients on parenteral nutrition are at risk of deficits in various plant-based nutrients, including lutein. In this review, we explain the pathogenesis of IFALD and summarize knowledge of the hepatoprotective properties of lutein, underscoring its potential as a treatment option. The hepatoprotective effects of lutein and their proposed mechanisms of action are supported by studies on cells and animals exposed to various liver-damaging factors, such as lipopolysaccharide, high-fat diet, alcohol, and more. Finally, we provide perspectives on the future application of lutein in therapy.",

This study explores the influences of pH (ranged from 1.5 to 7.5) and preheating treatment on the characteristics of caseinates-lutein (LU)/zeaxanthin (ZX) complexes and evaluates the potential application of caseinates as protective carriers in xanthophyll-fortified beverages. The properties and interactions of caseinates and two xanthophylls were systematically investigated utilizing a range of spectroscopic techniques, including ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), fluorescence spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Caseinates were bound to LU/ZX with a binding constant of the order 105 M-1. Furthermore, ZX exhibited a higher affinity for caseinates than LU. In particular, the decreased pH level of complex formulation and the preheating of caseinates at 85 °C strengthened the binding affinity between LU/ZX and caseinates. The caseinate-LU/ZX complexes effectively improved the chemical stability of LU/ZX and achieved a bioaccessibility rate of over 70 %. This study provides a guide for developing commercially available xanthophyll-fortified beverages and further expanding the application of caseinates as encapsulation carriers for extremely hydrophobic nutrients in the food industry.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Encapsulation of bioactive compounds within protein-based nanoparticles has garnered considerable attention in the food and pharmaceutical industries because of its potential to enhance stability and delivery. Soy protein isolate (SPI) has emerged as a promising candidate, prompting the present study aiming to modify its properties through controlled thermal and trypsin treatments for improved encapsulation efficiency (EE) of lutein and its storage stability. RESULTS: The EE of lutein nanoparticles encapsulated using SPI trypsin hydrolysates (SPIT) with three varying degrees of hydrolysis (4.11%, 6.91% and 10.61% for SPIT1, SPIT2 and SPIT3, respectively) increased by 12.00%, 15.78% and 18.59%, respectively, compared to SPI. Additionally, the photostability of SPIT2 showed a remarkable increase of 38.21% compared to SPI. The superior encapsulation efficiency and photostability of SPIT2 was attributed to increased exposure of hydrophobic groups, excellent antioxidant activity and uniform particle stability, despite exhibiting lower binding affinity to lutein compared to SPI. Furthermore, in SPIT2, the protein structure unfolded, with minimal impact on overall secondary structure upon lutein addition. CONCLUSION: The precise application of controlled thermal and trypsin treatments to SPI has been shown to effectively produce protein nanoparticles with substantially improved encapsulation efficiency for lutein and enhanced storage stability of the encapsulated lutein. These findings underscore the potential of controlled thermal and trypsin treatments to modify protein properties effectively and offer significant opportunities for expanding the applications of protein-based formulations across diverse fields. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Previous studies have shown that lutein has excellent adipose tissue affinity and antioxidative stress ability, however, the effects of oral lutein on fat transplantation have not yet been studied. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate whether oral lutein could improve fat transplantation retention by regulating oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammatory cytokine levels in graft tissues. METHODS: Nude mice were assigned to the control group (normal saline), low-dose lutein group (10 mg/kg/day), and high-dose lutein group (20 mg/kg/day) randomly. All mice received treatment by gavage 1 week before fat grafting and continued for 2 weeks. The grafts were collected 1, 2, and 12 weeks after treatment. By conducting histological analyses, Western blotting, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and cell metabolic function detection, the regulatory effects of lutein on apoptosis and oxidative stress in grafts were demonstrated. Additionally, RNA sequencing was conducted to further clarify the efficacy of lutein on fat grafting. RESULTS: Lutein induced superior graft retention, histological structures, and more viable adipocytes than the control group. It relieved tissue oxidative stress and lipid oxidative damage by decreasing reactive oxygen species and significantly reduced inflammation and apoptosis of grafts. RNA sequencing analysis confirmed that lutein could downregulate the gene expression of oxidative stress and related inflammation and apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that oral administration of lutein can improve fat graft survival by reducing the levels of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in grafted fat.",

However, its impact on steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) expression in ovarian granulosa cells is not well understood. This study demonstrates that COR downregulates STAR expression by reducing the expression of the SP1 transcription factor. ABSTRACT: Cordycepin (COR), a pure compound of Cordyceps, is known as an adenosine analog that exerts many beneficial effects on human health. The steroidogenesis mediated by ovarian granulosa cells is pivotal in maintaining normal female reproductive function. The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) regulates the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis. COR has been shown to stimulate STAR expression in mouse Leydig cells, the steroidogenic cells in the testes. However, the effect of COR on STAR expression in ovarian granulosa cells remains undetermined. In the present study, we show that treatment with COR downregulates STAR expression in a steroidogenic human granulosa-like tumor cell line, KGN, and primary culture of human granulosa-lutein (hGL) cells obtained from patients undergoing in vitro fertilization. We used specific adenosine receptor (AR) antagonists, and our results reveal that the inhibitory effect of COR on STAR expression is mediated by AR-A1, AR-A2A, and AR-A3. In both KGN and primary hGL cells, COR activates ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways, but only activation of ERK1/2 is required for the COR-induced downregulation of STAR expression. In addition, our results demonstrate that COR downregulates STAR expression by reducing the expression of the SP1 transcription factor. These results provide a better understanding of the biological function of COR on STAR expression in the ovary, which may lead to the development of alternative therapeutic approaches for female reproductive disorders.",

      "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are characterized by persistent changes in communication and social interaction, as well as restricted and stereotyped patterns of behavior. The complex etiology of these disorders possibly combines the effects of multiple genes and environmental factors. Hence, exposure to insecticides such as imidacloprid (IMI) has been used to replicate the changes observed in these disorders. Lutein is known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and is associated with neuroprotective effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of lutein-loaded nanoparticles, along with their mechanisms of action, on Drosophila melanogaster offspring exposed to IMI-induced damage. To simulate the neurodevelopmental disorder model, flies were exposed to a diet containing IMI for 7 days. Posteriorly, their offspring were exposed to a diet containing lutein-loaded nanoparticles for a period of 24 h, and male and female flies were subjected to behavioral and biochemical evaluations. Treatment with lutein-loaded nanoparticles reversed the parameters of hyperactivity, aggressiveness, social interaction, repetitive movements, and anxiety in the offspring of flies exposed to IMI. It also protected markers of oxidative stress and cell viability, in addition to preventing the reduction of Nrf2 and Shank3 immunoreactivity. These results demonstrate that the damage induced by exposure to IMI was restored through treatment with lutein-loaded nanoparticles, elucidating lutein's mechanisms of action as a therapeutic agent, which, after further studies, can become a co-adjuvant in the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ASD and ADHD.",

Although an active area of interest, topical therapy with antioxidants for the treatment of cataracts is complicated by multiple ocular anatomical barriers, product stability, and solubility. Entrapment and delivery of antioxidants with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles is a possible solution to these challenges, however, little is known regarding their effects in vitro or in vivo. Our first aim was to investigate the impact of blank and lutein loaded PLGA nanoparticles on viability and development of reactive oxygen species in lens epithelial cells in vitro. Photo-oxidative stress was induced by ultraviolet light exposure with cell viability and reactive oxygen species monitored. Next, an in vivo, selenite model was utilized to induce cataract formation in rodents. Eyes were treated topically with both free lutein and lutein loaded nanoparticles (LNP) at varying concentrations. Eyes were monitored for the development of anterior segment changes and cataract formation. The ability of nanodelivered lutein to reach the anterior segment of the eye was evaluated by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry of aqueous humor samples and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (targeted LC-MS/MS) of lenses. LNP had a minimal impact on the viability of lens epithelial cells during the short exposure timeframe (24 h) and at concentrations < 0.2 μg LNP/μl. A significant reduction in the development of reactive oxygen species was also noted. Animals treated with LNPs at an equivalent lutein concentration of 1,278 μg /mL showed the greatest reduction in cataract scores.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Systemic inflammation and oxidation are primary contributors to the development of atherosclerosis. Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles within the vascular endothelium has been hypothesized to be an initial step in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, with inflammatory cytokines serving as the signaling mechanism for concomitant macrophage activation. Supplementation with the antioxidative macular xanthophylls (lutein [L], zeaxanthin [Z], and meso-zeaxanthin [MZ]) has been shown to aid in the reduction of inflammatory physiologic responses; therefore, we hypothesized that in our study population, supplementation with these xanthophylls would facilitate a systemic reduction in markers of inflammation and cardiovascular lipid oxidation. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this double-blind placebo-controlled supplementation study, participants were randomly allocated to receive the active intervention containing L (10 mg) + MZ (10 mg) + Z (2 mg) or placebo (containing sunflower oil). Serum concentrations of carotenoids (assessed by HPLC), inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α) and oxidized LDL (OxLDL; by solid-phase sandwich ELISA) were measured at baseline and at 6-months. Results showed that over the supplementation period, compared to placebo, the active group demonstrated statistically significant increases in serum concentrations of L, Z, & MZ (p < 0.05), reductions in inflammatory cytokines IL-1β (p < 0.001) and TNF-α (p = 0.003), as well as a corresponding reduction in serum OxLDL (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that L, Z, & MZ supplementation results in decreased serum IL-1β, TNF-α, and OxLDL. This suggests that these carotenoids are acting systemically to attenuate oxidative lipid products and inflammation, thus reducing their contribution to atherosclerotic plaque formation.",

We investigated the impact of ultrasound on various factors, such as particle size, zeta potential, and interfacial protein/polysaccharide concentration. It was observed that ultrasound has significantly decreased droplet size and increased the surface area at the interface, hence promoting the adsorption of protein/polysaccharide. In the sonicated multilayer emulsion, the concentrations of interface proteins, pectin, and chitosan increased to 84.82 %, 90.49 %, and 83.31 %, respectively. The findings of the study indicated that the application of ultrasonic treatment had a significant impact on the emulsion's surface charge and the prevention of droplet aggregation. As a result, the stability of the emulsion system, including its resistance to salt, temperature, and storage conditions, has been significantly improved. Moreover, the emulsion showed an increase in the retention rate of lutein by 21.88 % after a high-temperature water bath and by 19.35 % after UV irradiation. Certainly, the multilayer emulsion treated with ultrasound demonstrated a superior and prolonged releasing behavior. These findings demonstrated the suitability of the ultrasound treatment for the preparation of emulsions to deliver bioactive compounds.",

Lutein is also the main carotenoid in the infant brain and is involved in cognitive development. While a few articles reviewed the role of lutein in early health and development, the current review is the first that focuses on the outcomes of lutein supplementation, either provided to mothers or to infants. Additionally, lutein status and metabolism during pregnancy and lactation, factors that limit the potential application of lutein as a nutritional intervention, and solutions to overcome the limitation are also discussed. In brief, the lutein intake in pregnant and lactating women in the United States may not be optimal. Furthermore, preterm and formula-fed infants are known to have compromised lutein status compared to term and breast-fed infants, respectively. While lutein supplementation via both maternal and infant consumption improves lutein status in infants, the application of lutein as a nutritional intervention may be compromised by its low bioavailability. Various encapsulation techniques have been developed to enhance the delivery of lutein in adult animals or human but should be further evaluated in neonatal models."

      "abstract": "High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are key regulators of cellular cholesterol homeostasis but are functionally altered in many chronic diseases. The factors that cause HDL functional loss in chronic disease are not fully understood. It is also unknown what roles antioxidant carotenoids play in protecting HDL against functional loss. The aim of this study was to measure how various disease-associated chemical factors including exposure to (1) Cu2+ ions, (2) hypochlorous acid (HOCL), (3) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), (4) sialidase, (5) glycosidase, (6) high glucose, (7) high fructose, and (8) acidic pH, and the carotenoid antioxidants (9) lutein and (10) zeaxanthin affect HDL functionality. We hypothesized that some of the modifications would have stronger impacts on HDL particle structure and function than others and that lutein and zeaxanthin would improve HDL function. HDL samples were isolated from generally healthy human plasma and incubated with the corresponding treatments listed above. Cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC), lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) activity, and paraoxonase-1 (PON1) activity were measured in order to determine changes in HDL functionality. Median HDL particle diameter was increased by acidic pH treatment and reduced by HOCl, high glucose, high fructose, N-glycosidase, and lutein treatments. Acidic pH, oxidation, and fructosylation all reduced HDL CEC, whereas lutein, zeaxanthin, and sialidase treatment improved HDL CEC. LCAT activity was reduced by acidic pH, oxidation, high fructose treatments, and lutein. PON1 activity was reduced by sialidase, glycosidase, H2O2, and fructose and improved by zeaxanthin and lutein treatment. These results show that exposure to oxidizing agents, high fructose, and low pH directly impairs HDL functionality related to cholesterol efflux and particle maturation, whereas deglycosylation impairs HDL antioxidant capacity. On the other hand, the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin improve or preserve both HDL cholesterol efflux and antioxidant activity but have no effect on particle maturation."

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a member of the interleukin family that widely participates in the regulation of the inflammatory response in the immune system. In addition, it has been reported that aberrant IL-1 accumulation in serum is associated with the occurrence of PCOS. However, little is known about how IL-1 participates in the pathogenesis of PCOS. In the present study, we demonstrated that the immune microenvironment was altered in follicular fluid from PCOS patients and that the expression levels of two IL-1 cytokines, IL-1α and IL-1β were increased. Transcriptome analysis revealed that IL-1α and IL-1β treatment induced primary human granulosa-lutein (hGL) cell inflammatory response and increased the expression of serpin family E member 1 (SERPINE1). Mechanistically, we demonstrated that IL-1α and IL-1β upregulated SERPINE1 expression through IL-1R1-mediated activation of downstream P50 and P52 signaling pathways in human granulosa cells. Our study highlighted the role of immune state changes in the occurrence of PCOS and provided new insight into the treatment of patients with IL-1-induced ovarian function disorders.",

Lutein has a favorable effect on the treatment of dAMD. Algae oil, rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is considered an effective intervention for eye diseases. In this study, casein-mannose conjugates were prepared to form algal oil-in-water Pickering emulsions by ultrasound-assisted Maillard reaction. As the ultrasound time increased from 0 to 25 min, the droplet size decreased to 648.2 ± 21.18 nm, which substantially improved the stability of the Pickering emulsions. The retention of lutein in the Pickering emulsions under ultrasonic treatment for 20 min was significantly improved under different conditions. The simulated gastrointestinal digestion revealed that ultrasound-assisted Pickering emulsions are an effective method for improving the bioaccessibility of lutein (19.76%-53.34%). In vivo studies elucidated that the lutein-loaded Pickering emulsions could effectively alleviate retinal thinning induced by sodium iodate (NaIO3) in mice with dAMD. Mechanistically, lutein-loaded Pickering emulsions significantly reduced oxidative stress by decreasing the MDA level, increasing the SOD production, and reducing the retinal ROS production. These findings explored the protective effects of lutein-loaded Pickering emulsions on dAMD and offered promising prospects for the nutritional intervention of dAMD.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of low and high doses of lutein administration in bilateral-carotid vessel occlusion (2VO) rats. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: The rats were divided into the following groups: the control, sham-, vehicle (2VO+V) groups, and two groups after 2VO were treated with lutein 0.5 (2VO+LUT-o.5) and 5mg/kg (2VO+LUT-5). The passive-avoidance and Morris water maze were performed to examine fear and spatial memory. The field-potential recording was used to investigate the properties of basal synaptic transmission (BST), paired-pulse ratio (PPR), as an index for measurement of neurotransmitter release, and long-term potentiation (LTP). The hippocampus was removed to evaluate hippocampal cells, volume, and MDA level. RESULT: Treatment with low and high doses improves spatial memory and LTP impairment in VD rats, but only the high dose restores the fear memory, hippocampal cell loss, and volume and MDA level. Interestingly, low-dose, but not high-dose, increased PPR. However, BST recovered only in the high-dose treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with a low dose might affect neurotransmitter release probability, but a high dose affects postsynaptic processes. It seems likely that low and high doses improve memory and LTP through different mechanisms.",

Pentraxin 3 (PTX3), an essential ovulatory protein, is necessary for maintaining extracellular matrix (ECM) stability during cumulus expansion. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of EGF-like factors, AREG, BTC, and EREG on the expression and production of PTX3 in human granulosa-lutein (hGL) cells and the molecular mechanisms involved. Our results demonstrated that AREG, BTC, and EREG could regulate follicular function by upregulating the expression and increasing the production of PTX3 in both primary (obtained from 20 consenting patients undergoing IVF treatment) and immortalized hGL cells. The upregulation of PTX3 expression was primarily facilitated by the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway, induced by these EGF-like factors. In addition, we found that the upregulation of PTX3 expression triggered by the EGF-like factors was completely reversed by either pretreatment with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, AG1478, or knockdown of EGFR, suggesting that EGFR is crucial for activating the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in hGL cells. Overall, our findings indicate that AREG, BTC, and EREG may modulate human cumulus expansion during the periovulatory stage through the upregulation of PTX3.",

To critically assess lutein biosynthesis, therapeutic applicability, and market research literature. We have discussed its theoretical frameworks, experimental evidence, limitations, as well as clinical trial results, and future research prospects. The literature for this review article was mined and compiled by collecting and analyzing articles from several databases, including ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, PubMed, Wiley Online Library, Patentscope, and ClinicalTrials.gov published until March 30, 2022. Patent publications were identified using the search terms like IC:(C07C67/56) AND EN_AB:(lutein) OR EN_TI:(lutein) OR EN_AB:(extraction) OR EN_TI:(process). According to the literature, lutein is an essential nutrient given that it cannot be synthesized in the human body and acts as an antioxidant, affecting AMD, diabetic retinopathy, Rheumatic diseases, inflammation, and cancer. Due to inadequate production and laborious extraction, lutein is expensive despite its high demand and applicability. Market research predicts a 6.3% compound annual growth rate for lutein by 2032. Optimizing lutein extraction for high yield and purity is necessary. Lutein has proven applicability in various ailments as well as cosmetics that can be developed as a candidate drug for various diseases discussed in the review.",

The sizes and surface shapes of the superfine SP particles were more homogeneous and smoother than those of the other samples. SJ made with SP-superfine and treated with PEF had the highest lutein content and antioxidant activities among the group during storage.

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD) are the two most common progressive neurodegenerative diseases with limited knowledge on their cause and, presently, have no cure. There is an existence of multiple treatment methods that target only the symptoms temporarily and do not stop the progression or prevent the onset of disease. Neurodegeneration is primarily attributed to the natural process of aging and the deleterious effects of heightened oxidative stress within the brain, whether via direct or indirect mechanisms. Emerging evidence suggests that certain nutritional aspects play a crucial role in the prevention and management of neurodegenerative diseases. Lutein, a dietary carotenoid, has been studied for its antioxidant properties for more than a decade with several applications against age-related macular degeneration. It is high antioxidant potential and selective accumulation in the brain makes it a versatile compound for combatting various neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, the studies exhibiting neuroprotective properties of lutein against neurodegenerative conditions, more specifically AD and PD in various model systems as well as clinical observations have been reviewed. Accordingly, the concerns associated with lutein absorption and potential strategies to improve its bioavailability have been discussed.",

The results showed that the sequence of ultrasound followed by ethanol treatment was the optimal one. The samples were subjected to ultrasonication followed by subunit disassembly and reassembly induced by 40% (v/v) ethanol, with the resulting molecular unfolding and subsequent aggregation being attributed to intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The recombined nanoparticles had smaller particle size (142.43 ± 2.91 nm) and turbidity (0.16 ± 0.01), and the exposure of more hydrophobic groups (H0 = 6221.00 ± 130.20) induced a shift of SPI structure toward a more ordered direction. The homogeneous and stable particle provided excellent stability for the loading of lutein. The bioaccessibility (from 25.48 ± 2.35 to 65.85 ± 1.78%) and release rate of lutein were modulated in gastrointestinal digestion experiments. Our discoveries provide a new perspective for the development of combined physicochemical modification of proteins as nanocarriers in functional foods.",

      "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of visual impairment in the aging population, lacks effective treatment options due to a limited understanding of its pathogenesis. Lutein, with its strong antioxidant properties and ability to mitigate AMD by absorbing ultraviolet (UV) rays, faces challenges related to its stability and bioavailability in functional foods. In this study, we aimed to develop delivery systems using protein-saccharide conjugates to enhance lutein delivery and protect adult retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells against sodium iodate (NaIO3)-induced damage. Various saccharides, including mannose, galactose, lactose, maltose, dextran, and maltodextrin, were conjugated to casein via the Maillard reaction for lutein delivery. The resulting lutein-loaded nanoparticles exhibited small size and spherical characteristics and demonstrated improved thermal stability and antioxidant capacity compared to free lutein. Notably, these nanoparticles were found to be nontoxic, as evidenced by reduced levels of cellular reactive oxygen species production (167.50 ± 3.81, 119.57 ± 3.45, 195.15 ± 1.41, 183.96 ± 3.11, 254.21 ± 3.97, 283.56 ± 7.27%) and inhibition of the mitochondrial membrane potential decrease (58.60 ± 0.29, 65.05 ± 2.91, 38.88 ± 1.81, 42.95 ± 1.39, 23.52 ± 1.04, 25.24 ± 0.08%) caused by NaIO3, providing protection against cellular damage and death. Collectively, our findings suggest that lutein-loaded nanoparticles synthesized via the Maillard reaction hold promise for enhanced solubility, oral bioavailability, and biological efficacy in the treatment of AMD.",

In this study, we tested whether a similar intervention could improve such outcomes in preadolescent children. METHODS: Sixty children (age range 5-12 years) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio in this double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Subjects were supplemented with gummies containing either a combination of 10 mg lutein and 2 mg zeaxanthin (LZ) or placebo for 180 days. Macular pigment optical density (MPOD) was the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoints included serum levels of L and Z, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), critical flicker fusion (CFF), eye strain and fatigue using visual analogue scales (VAS), Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire-Abbreviated (CSHQ-A), and Creyos Health cognitive domains like attention, focus/concentration, episodic memory and learning, visuospatial working memory, and visuospatial processing speed. Safety was assessed throughout the study on the basis of physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and monitoring of adverse events. RESULTS: The LZ group showed significant increases in MPOD at all visits post-supplementation, with significant increases as early as day 42 compared to placebo. The LZ group showed significant increases in serum lutein levels, reduced eye strain and fatigue, and improved cognitive performance (focus, episodic memory and learning, visuospatial working memory) at days 90 and 180 compared to placebo. Further, the LZ group showed significant increases in processing speed (CFF), attention, visuospatial processing, and serum Z and BDNF levels on day 180 compared to placebo. No safety concerns were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementing LZ resulted in increased MPOD levels, along with increased serum levels of L, Z, and BDNF. These changes were associated with improved visual and cognitive performances and reduction in eye strain and eye fatigue in the children receiving LZ gummies. The investigational product was safe and well tolerated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: http://ctri.nic.in/ Identifier CTRI/2022/05/042364.",

      "abstract": "A hydatidiform mole (HM), often known as molar pregnancy, is a type of prenatal trophoblastic illness that develops in the placenta and has the potential to spread. HMs are caused by genetic issues with either the egg or the sperm. They are typically discovered in the first trimester of pregnancy. Abnormal bleeding is one of the initial symptoms, which can seldom be accompanied by the passage of hydropic villi. Theca lutein cysts, absent fetal heart tones, enlarged uterus more than anticipated for gestational age, pregnancy-induced hypertension in the first trimester, hyperemesis, and increased levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) for gestational dates are other characteristic symptoms and signs. A rare type of follicular cyst known as a theca lutein cyst is a benign ovarian disease caused by natural overstimulation of follicles, also known as hyperreactio lutealis (HL). This is linked to choriocarcinomas, multiple gestations, and prenatal trophoblastic illness (molar pregnancy). Unless exacerbated by torsion, rupture, or bleeding, the majority of theca lutein cysts are treated conservatively. Theca lutein cysts do not impact the course of pregnancy and spontaneously recede following delivery. However, HL may mistakenly be diagnosed by doctors as a cancer during pregnancy if it has the potential to look like one. Frequently, inappropriate surgical intervention is caused by the fear of failing to diagnose malignancy. These treatments may therefore result in decreased fertility in the future. Here we present a case of a young unmarried female with an HM and cysts."

This research evaluated the impact of sunlight intensity on intracellular pigment generation and phosphorus removal from secondary effluents by autoflocculating microalgae consortium BR-UANL-01 in photobioreactor culture. Microalgae were grown in a secondary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant, using a combination of low and high light conditions (photon irradiance; 44 μmol m-2 s-1 and ≈ 1270 μmol m-2 s-1, respectively) and 16:8 h light:dark and 24:0 h light:dark (subdivided into 18:6 LED:sunlight) photoperiods. The autoflocculant rate by consortium BR-UANL-01 was not affected by light intensity and achieved 98% in both treatments. Microalgae produced significantly more lutein, (2.91 mg g-1) under low light conditions. Phosphate removal by microalgae resulted above 85% from the secondary effluent, due to the fact that phosphorus is directly associated with metabolic and replication processes and the highest antioxidant activity was obtained in ABTS•+ assay by the biomass under low light condition (51.71% μmol ET g-1). In conclusion, the results showed that the autoflocculating microalgae consortium BR-UANL-01 is capable of synthesizing intracellular lutein, which presents antioxidant activity, using secondary effluents as a growth medium, without losing its autoflocculating activity and assimilating phosphorus."

      "abstract": "Ovarian steroidogenesis mediated by granulosa cells is pivotal in maintaining normal female reproductive function. The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) regulates the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis. Bone morphogenetic protein-9 (BMP-9), also known as growth differentiation factor-2 (GDF-2), is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. BMP-9 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that contributes to cancer progression. However, the function of BMP-9 in the female reproductive system remains largely unknown. It has been recently shown that BMP-9 is expressed in human follicular fluid and can downregulate StAR expression in human ovarian granulosa cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms warrant investigation. Our results show that treatment of primary granulosa-lutein (hGL) cells with BMP-9 downregulates StAR expression. In addition, two EMT-related transcription factors, Snail and Slug, are upregulated by the treatment of BMP-9. Using pharmacological inhibitors and a siRNA-mediated knockdown approach, we show that BMP-9 upregulates Snail and Slug expression by activating SMAD1/5/8 signaling. We also examine the effects of BMP-9 on SMAD-independent signaling pathways, including ERK1/2, p38, JNK, AKT, and CREB. However, none of them is affected by the BMP-9. Moreover, we use gain- and loss-of-function approaches to reveal that only Snail, not Slug, is required for the BMP-9-induced downregulation of StAR expression in hGL cells. This study increases the understanding of the physiology function of BMP-9 in hGL cells and provides important insights into the regulation of StAR expression.",

Several plant-derived substances, such as lutein and quercetagetin (QCG), show promise in supporting eye health. In this study, the impact of lutein/zeaxanthin (L/Z, Lutemax 2020) and QCG were evaluated individually and together in a rat model of LED-induced retinal damage. A total of 63 Wistar rats were allocated into nine groups (n = 7). For 28 days, the rats received L/Z (10 or 20 mg/kg BW), quercetin (QC, 20 mg/kg BW), QCG (10 or 20 mg/kg BW), or a mixture of different lutein and QCG dosages, after which they were exposed to LED light for 48 h. LED exposure led to a spike in serum malondialdehyde (MDA) and inflammatory cytokines, as well as an increase in retinal NF-κB, ICAM, GFAP, and MCP-1 levels (p < 0.0001 for all). It also reduced serum antioxidant enzyme activities and retinal Nrf2, HO-1, GAP43, NCAM, and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness (p < 0.0001 for all). However, administering L/Z and QCG, particularly a 1:1 combination of L/Z and QCG at 20 mg/kg, effectively reversed these changes. The treatment suppressed NF-κB, ICAM, GFAP, and MCP-1 while enhancing Nrf2, HO-1, GAP43, and NCAM and preventing ONL thickness reduction in LED-induced retinal damage rats. In conclusion, while LED light exposure caused retinal damage, treatment with L/Z, QC, and QCG, particularly a combined L/Z and QCG regimen, exhibited protective effects on the retina. This is possibly due to the modulation of neuroplasticity markers and nuclear transcription factors in the rats' retinal cells."

Despite the availability of various treatment options, FM remains a challenging condition to manage. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of formulated nanodispersions of lutein and beta-carotene in treating FM-related symptoms induced by reserpine in female Wistar rats. Several techniques have been implemented to assess this efficacy at various levels, including biochemical, bioelectrical, and behavioral. Namely, oxidative stress markers, monoamine levels, electrocorticography, pain threshold test, and open field test were conducted on control, FM-induced, and FM-treated groups of animals. Our results provided compelling evidence for the efficacy of carotenoid nanodispersions in treating FM-related symptoms. Specifically, we found that the dual action of the nanodispersion, as both antioxidant and antidepressant, accounted for their beneficial effects in treating FM. With further investigation, nano-carotenoids and particularly nano-lutein could potentially become an effective alternative treatment for patients with FM who do not respond to current treatment options.",

Compared to the LUT alone treatment group, in the LUT combined with EGCG (LUT-EGCG) treatment group, the accumulation content of LUT was significantly increased by 50.24% in the liver. The morphological results indicated that LUT-EGCG treatment significantly improved the retina structure with the thickness of the outer nuclear layer restored to 185.28 ± 0.29 μm, showing no significant difference compared to the control group. The LUT-EGCG treatment also increased the production of short-chain fatty acids, such as acetic and propionic acids. Compared with the LUT alone treatment, the LUT-EGCG treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Helicobacteraceae. RT-qPCR results indicated that LUT-EGCG treatment significantly increased the antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 expression. In addition, the expression of IL-6 was significantly down-regulated in the LUT-EGCG group, while there was no significance in NF-κβ, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-18 compared with the LUT group. Correlation analysis supported the conclusion that LUT combined with EGCG may improve RP by modulating antiapoptotic gene expression and regulating the abundance of gut microbiota.

To address this, a biomimetic drug delivery system-MMLNPs was established by coating macrophage membranes (MMs) onto lutein-loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (LNPs). This study characterized the physical properties of biomimetic nanoparticles and examined the targeting capability, therapeutic effects and mechanism, and biosecurity of administering them for cardiac fibrosis therapy in the transverse aortic constriction (TAC) model and in vitro. Transmission electron microscope mapping and dynamic light scattering analysis proved that MMLNPs were spherical nanoparticles camouflaged by a layer of cell membrane and had negative zeta potential. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry analysis showed that MMs on the biomimetic nanoparticles hindered the phagocytosis of macrophages and facilitated the targeting of activated endothelial cells. Ex vivo fluorescence imaging experiments demonstrated the targeting of biomimetic nanoparticles to the injured heart. EdU assay indicated that MMLNPs have the same potential to inhibit angiotensin (Ang) II-induced cardiac fibroblast proliferation as free lutein. Furthermore, echocardiography showed that MMLNPs improved cardiac function and structure, and Masson staining and western blotting showed that MMLNPs ameliorated cardiac fibrosis. We found MMLNPs inhibited the interleukin (IL)-11/ERK signaling pathway which was up-regulated in the TAC model compared to the sham-operated mouse. Biochemical testing and hematoxylin and eosin staining proved that the long-term use of MMLNPs lacked biological toxicity. Collectively, MMLNPs might be a promising nanodrug delivery approach to attenuate pressure overload (PO)-induced cardiac fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "Liposomes are considered the best nanocarrier for delivering cancer drugs such as chlorin e6 (Ce6) and paclitaxel (PTX). However, the poor stability and non-selectivity release of liposomes may severely limit their further applications. In this study, based on the characteristics of lutein (L) photo-response and orthoester (OE) acid-response, stable and dual-responsive liposomes (Dr-lips) have been prepared. The Dr-lips exhibited a spherical shape with a uniform size of approximately 58.27 nm. Moreover, they displayed a zeta potential ranging from -45.45 to -28.25 mV and showed excellent storage stability, indicating stable colloidal properties. Additionally, they achieved high drug encapsulation rates, with 92.27% for PTX and 90.34% for Ce6, respectively. Meanwhile, under near-infrared (NIR) light at 660 nm, Ce6 plays a key role in accelerating the photodegradation rate of lutein and PEG-OE-L while also enhancing tissue penetration ability. Additionally, Dr-lips loaded with Ce6 and PTX not only displayed excellent pH and photo dual-responsiveness for targeted delivering and releasing but also showed remarkable reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capacity and impressive anti-tumor activity in vitro. Therefore, it provides a novel strategy for optimizing stability and enhancing their targeted drug delivery of liposome."

      "abstract": "Microalgae are proposed to have powerful applications for human health in the pharmaceutical and food industries. Tetraselmis species (sp.), which are green microalgae, were identified as a source of broad-spectrum health-promoting biological activities. However, the bioactivity of these species has not been elucidated. We aimed to confirm the antioxidant, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory effects of Tetraselmis sp. extract (TEE). TEE showed 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate radical and hydrogen peroxide scavenging activities and reduced plaque formation in Vero E6 cells infected with vaccinia virus. TEE treatment also significantly inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production and improved cell viability in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells. These anti-inflammatory effects were further analyzed in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells and the zebrafish model. Further, TEE reduced induced NO synthase expression and proinflammatory cytokine release, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β, through MAPKs and NF-κB-dependent mechanisms. Further analysis revealed that TEE increased the survival rate and reduced cell death and NO production in an LPS-stimulated zebrafish model. Further, high-performance liquid chromatography revealed a strong presence of the carotenoid lutein in TEE. Overall, the results suggest that lutein-enriched TEE may be a potent antioxidant, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory agent that could be sustainably utilized in industrial applications.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is traditionally managed using disease-modifying pharmaceutical therapies as a first line approach for treatment, yet there is increasing interest in lifestyle factors, particularly diet, for managing disease outcomes. Lutein has neuroprotective properties in healthy adults, but no previous research has examined the effects of lutein supplementation in persons with MS. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of 4-mo lutein supplementation on carotenoid status and cognition in persons with relapse-remitting MS (RRMS). METHODS: A randomized controlled, single-blind research design was used among adults with RRMS (N = 21). Participants were randomized into placebo (n = 9) or treatment (20-mg/d lutein, n = 12) groups with outcomes measured before and after 4 mo. Macular pigment optical density (MPOD) was assessed using heterochromatic flicker photometry. Skin carotenoids were assessed using reflection spectroscopy. Serum lutein was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Cognition was assessed via the Eriksen flanker with event-related potentials, spatial reconstruction, and the symbol digit modalities tests. RESULTS: There was a significant group by time interaction for MPOD (F = 6.74, P = 0.02), skin carotenoids (F = 17.30, P < 0.01), and serum lutein (F = 24.10, P < 0.01), whereby the treatment group improved in all carotenoid outcomes. There were no significant group by time interactions for cognitive and neuroelectric outcomes. However, increase in MPOD was positively associated with accuracy during the flanker incongruent trials (r = 0.55, P = 0.03) and the spatial memory task (r = 0.58, P = 0.02) among treatment participants. CONCLUSIONS: Lutein supplementation increases carotenoid status among persons with RRMS. There is no significant effect on cognitive function but change in macular carotenoids is selectively associated with improved attention and memory. This study provides preliminary support for a fully powered study targeting retinal and neural carotenoids for cognitive benefits in persons with MS. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04843813.",

Fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy (FLIO) is a novel in vivo retinal imaging method that has been shown to correlate to classical MPOD measurements and might contribute to a metabolic mapping of the retina in the future. Our aim was to show that oral supplementation of L and Z affects the FLIO signal in a positive way in patients with AMD. METHODS: This was a prospective, single center, open label cohort study. Patients with early and intermediate AMD received oral L and Z supplementation during three months, and were observed for another three months after therapy termination. All visits included measurements of clinical parameters, serum L and Z concentration, MPOD measurements using heterochromatic flicker photometry, dual wavelength autofluorescence imaging, and FLIO. Correlation analysis between FLIO and MPOD were performed. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients completed the follow up period. Serum L and Z concentrations significantly increased during supplementation (mean difference 244.8 ng/ml; 95% CI: 81.26-419.9, and 77.1 ng/ml; 95% CI: 5.3-52.0, respectively). Mean MPOD units significantly increased (mean difference 0.06; 95% CI: 0.02-0.09; at 0.5°, 202; 95% CI: 58-345; at 2°, 1033; 95% CI: 288-1668; at 9° of eccentricity, respectively) after three months of supplementation with macular xanthophylls, which included L and Z. Median FLIO lifetimes in the foveal center significantly decreased from 277.3 ps (interquartile range 230.2-339.1) to 261.0 ps (interquartile range 231.4-334.4, p = 0.027). All parameters returned to near-normal values after termination of the nutritional supplementation. A significant negative correlation was found between FLIO and MPOD (r2 = 0.57, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: FLIO is able to detect subtle changes in MPOD after L and Z supplementation in patients with early and intermediate AMD. Our findings confirm the previous described negative correlation between FLIO and MPOD. Macular xanthophylls seem to contribute to short foveal lifetimes. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier number NCT04761341).",

The results showed that when the mass ratio of SPI to lutein was 25:1, the encapsulation efficiency of lutein in PSPI11 increased from 54% to 77%, and the loading capacity increased by 41% compared to the original SPI. The formed SPI-lutein composite nanoparticles (PSPI11-LUTNPs) had smaller, more homogeneous sizes and larger negative charges than SPI7-LUTNPs. The combined treatment favored the unfolding of the SPI structure and could expose its interior hydrophobic groups to bind with lutein. Nanocomplexation with SPIs significantly improved the solubility and stability of lutein, with PSPI11 showing the greatest improvement. As a result, PEF combined with pH shifting pretreatment is an effective method for developing SPI nanoparticles loaded and protected with lutein.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The gap junction protein, connexin 43 (Cx43) is highly expressed in human granulosa-lutein (hGL) cells. The phosphorylation of certain amino acid residues in the Cx43 protein has been shown to be related to a decline in gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC), which subsequently affects oocyte meiotic resumption. As a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, betacellulin (BTC) mediates luteinizing hormone (LH)-induced oocyte maturation and cumulus cell expansion in mammalian follicles. Whether BTC can regulate Cx43 phosphorylation, which further reduces Cx43-coupled GJIC activity in hGL cells remains to be determined. METHODS: Immortalized human granulosa cells (SVOG cells) and primary human granulosa-lutein cells obtained from women undergoing in vitro fertilization in an academic research center were used as the study models. The expression levels of Cx43 and phosphorylated Cx43 were examined following cell incubation with BTC at different time points. Several kinase inhibitors (sotrastaurin, AG1478, and U0126) and small interfering RNAs targeting EGF receptor (EGFR) and receptor tyrosine-protein kinase 4 (ErbB4) were used to verify the specificity of the effects and to investigate the molecular mechanisms. Real-time-quantitative PCR and western blot analysis were used to detect the specific mRNA and protein levels, respectively. GJIC between SVOG cells were evaluated using a scrape loading and dye transfer assay. Results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: The results showed that BTC induced the rapid phosphorylation of Cx43 at serine368 without altering the expression of Cx43 in primary and immortalized hGL cells. Additionally, using a dual inhibition approach (kinase inhibitors and siRNA-based expression knockdown), we demonstrated that this effect was mainly mediated by the EGFR but not the ErbB4 receptor. Furthermore, using a protein kinase C (PKC) kinase assay and a scrape-loading and dye transfer assay, we revealed that PKC signaling is the downstream signaling pathway that mediates the increase in Cx43 phosphorylation and subsequent decrease in GJIC activity in response to BTC treatment in hGL cells. CONCLUSIONS: BTC promptly induced the phosphorylation of connexin 43 at Ser368, leading to decreased GJIC activity in hGL cells. The BTC-induced cellular activities were most likely driven by the EGFR-mediated PKC-dependent signaling pathway. Our findings shed light on the detailed molecular mechanisms by which BTC regulates the process of oocyte meiotic resumption.",

The protective effect of emulsion gels induced in different ways on lutein was investigated, and the stability of lutein in emulsion gels and processed cheese was analyzed. The results showed that the acidification rate of CA was higher than that of GDL, which was the key step in acid-induced gels, and that the difference in acidification rate led to differences in gel structure. Compared with the 2 acid inducers (GDL and CA), TG exhibited greater potential for forming gel structures with high strength. The TG-induced emulsion gels showed the best physical stability and the highest embedding efficiency for lutein. After heat treatment (85°C), the GDL-induced emulsion gels had higher retention rate of lutein and showed good thermal stability compared with the CA-induced emulsion gels. The processed cheese added with the TG-induced emulsion gel had higher hardness and springiness compared with the processed cheese added with the other 2 kinds of emulsion gels, whereas the processed cheese added with the CA-induced emulsion gel had a lower density of network structure, showing porosity and a larger aggregated structure, but the highest bioavailability of lutein. These results provide valuable information for the formation of cold-set emulsion gel and provide the possibility for the application of emulsion gel embedding active substances in processed cheese.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a serious complication during in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. The upregulation of ovarian transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) is involved in the development of OHSS. The secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a secreted multifunctional matricellular glycoprotein. Although the regulatory effects of TGF-β1 on SPARC expression have been reported, whether TGF-β1 regulates SPARC expression in the human ovary remains unknown. In addition, the role of SPARC in the pathogenesis of OHSS is unclear. METHODS: A steroidogenic human ovarian granulosa-like tumor cell line, KGN, and primary culture of human granulosa-lutein (hGL) cells obtained from patients undergoing IVF treatment were used as experimental models. OHSS was induced in rats, and ovaries were collected. Follicular fluid samples were collected from 39 OHSS and 35 non-OHSS patients during oocyte retrieval. The underlying molecular mechanisms mediating the effect of TGF-β1 on SPARC expression were explored by a series of in vitro experiments. RESULTS: TGF-β1 upregulated SPARC expression in both KGN and hGL cells. The stimulatory effect of TGF-β1 on SPARC expression was mediated by SMAD3 but not SMAD2. The transcription factors, Snail and Slug, were induced in response to the TGF-β1 treatment. However, only Slug was required for the TGF-β1-induced SPARC expression. Conversely, we found that the knockdown of SPARC decreased Slug expression. Our results also revealed that SPARC was upregulated in the OHSS rat ovaries and in the follicular fluid of OHSS patients. Knockdown of SPARC attenuated the TGF-β1-stimulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and aromatase, two markers of OHSS. Moreover, the knockdown of SPARC reduced TGF-β1 signaling by downregulating SMAD4 expression. CONCLUSIONS: By illustrating the potential physiological and pathological roles of TGF-β1 in the regulation of SPARC in hGL cells, our results may serve to improve current strategies used to treat clinical infertility and OHSS.

The optimized LUT-CS/Alg-Fe3O4-NPs with a balance among LUT concentration, copolymer coating, and iron ion concentration exhibited controlled size, narrow size distribution, better crystallinity, excellent saturation magnetization, and sustained-release profile. The negligible magnetic coercivity and remanent magnetization confirmed the superparamagnetism of the prepared NPs. The optimized LUT-CS/Alg-Fe3O4-NPs were biocompatible while exhibiting a significantly enhanced cytotoxicity towards breast cancer MCF-7 cells upon exposure to a permanent magnet compared to free LUT with a 4-fold increase, suggesting the potential of LUT-CS/Alg-Fe3O4-NPs as magnetically targeted delivery for breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death. In particular, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases. Due to tumor resistance and the toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents, it is increasingly critical to discover novel, potent antitumorigenic drugs for treating NSCLC. Lutein, a carotenoid, has been reported to exert toxic effects on cells in several tumor types. However, the detailed functions and underlying mechanisms of lutein in NSCLC remain elusive. The present study showed that lutein significantly and dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation, arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, and induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that the p53 signaling pathway was the most significantly upregulated in lutein-treated A549 cells. Mechanistically, lutein exerted antitumorigenic effects by inducing DNA damage and subsequently activating the ATR/Chk1/p53 signaling pathway in A549 cells. In vivo, lutein impeded tumor growth in mice and prolonged their survival. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the antitumorigenic potential of lutein and reveal its molecular mechanism of action, suggesting that lutein is a promising candidate for clinical NSCLC treatment.",

      "abstract": "Lutein plays a crucial role in the protection of retina by diminishing oxidative stress in diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, its poor aqueous solubility, chemical instability and low bioavailability edge its application. Also, beneficial effects of lutein supplementation and lower lutein levels in the serum and retina of DR patients created an interest in nanopreparation. Hence, lutein-loaded chitosan‑sodium alginate nanocarrier comprising oleic acid core (LNCs) was developed and examined its protective effect on hyperglycemia-mediated changes in oxidative stress and angiogenesis in ARPE-19 cells. Results showed that the LNCs have smaller size and a smooth spherical morphology and did not affect the ARPE-19 cell viability (up to 20 μM) and showed higher cellular uptake in both normal and H2O2-induced stress conditions. LNCs pre-treatment suppressed the H2O2-induced oxidative stress and CoCl2-induced hypoxia-mediated elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, protein carbonyl and malondialdehyde levels by restoring antioxidant enzymes in ARPE-19 cells. Further, LNCs protected H2O2-mediated down-regulation of Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant enzymes. LNCs also restored the H2O2-altered angiogenic (Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) and Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α)), endoplasmic reticulum stress (activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4)) and tight junction (Zona occludens 1 (ZO-1)) markers. To conclude, we could successfully develop biodegradable LNCs to improve the cellular uptake of lutein to treat DR by curtailing oxidative stress in retina.",

      "abstract": "The anti-inflammatory role of lutein has been widely recognized, however, the underlying mechanism is still not fully elucidated. Hence, the effects of lutein on the intestinal health and growth performance of broilers and the action of mechanism were investigated. 288 male yellow-feathered broilers (1-day old) were randomly allocated to 3 treatment groups with 8 replicates of 12 birds each, and the control group was fed a broken rice-soybean basal diet, while the test groups were fed a basal diet added with 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg of lutein (LU20, LU40), respectively. The feeding trial lasted for 21 d. The results showed that 40 mg/kg lutein supplementation tended to increase ADFI (P = 0.10) and ADG (P = 0.08) of broilers. Moreover, the addition of lutein caused a decreasing trend of gene expression and concentration of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β (P = 0.08, P = 0.10, respectively) and IL-6 (P = 0.06, P = 0.06, respectively) and also tended to decrease the gene expression of TLR4 (P = 0.09) and MyD88 (P = 0.07) while increasing gene expression and concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 (P < 0.05) in the jejunum mucosa of broilers. Additionally, lutein supplementation increased the jejunal villi height of broilers (P < 0.05) and reduced villi damage. The experiment in vitro showed that lutein treatment reduced the gene expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ in chicken intestinal epithelial cells (P < 0.05). However, this effect was diminished after knock-down of TLR4 or MyD88 genes using RNAi technology. In conclusion, lutein can inhibit the expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in the jejunum mucosa and promote intestinal development of broilers, and the anti-inflammatory effect may be achieved by regulating TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This paper aims to reveal the molecular mechanism of resveratrol against oxidative stress and cell injury. The ovarian granulosa-lutein cell injury and apoptosis induced by oxidative stress may be responsible for female luteal phase deficiency. The antioxidant function of resveratrol has been confirmed; however, its effect on the expression of antioxidant enzymes and regulatory mechanisms in ovarian granulosa-lutein cells remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the role of the SIRT1/Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway in the effect of resveratrol on the hydrogen peroxide-induced injury of rat ovarian granulosa-lutein cells. METHODS: In this study, ovarian granulosa-lutein cells extracted from 3-week female SD rats were treated with 200 μM H2O2 in the presence or absence of 20 μM resveratrol. siRNA-SIRT1 and siRNA-Nrf2 were used to inhibit the expression of SIRT1 and Nrf2, respectively. Cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8), cellular morphology, progesterone secretion, and estradiol were used to evaluate cell injury. Hoechst 33258 staining was used to measure cell apoptosis. DHE staining, DCFH-DA staining, malondialdehyde content, protein carbonyl content, total antioxidant capacity and SOD viability were used to estimate the levels of oxidative stress. Western blot analysis was used to detect the levels of apoptosis-related proteins, and SIRT1/Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway-related proteins. RESULTS: The H2O2 treatment-induced rat ovarian granulosa-lutein cells injury was shown as decreased cell viability, impaired cellular morphology, and decreased levels of progesterone and estradiol. The H2O2 treatment also exacerbated cell apoptosis demonstrated as more apoptotic cells stained by Hoechst staining, decreased level of anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 and increased level of pro-apoptosis protein Bax. These effects of cell injury and apoptosis induced by H2O2 can be ameliorated by resveratrol. Resveratrol also alleviated oxidative stress induced by H2O2, supported by decreased superoxide anion and cellular total ROS, decreased malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl levels, and increased total antioxidant capacity and SOD viability. Western blot results demonstrated resveratrol reversed the H2O2-induced decrease in levels of antioxidant enzymes containing ARE sequences and activated SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway. Further treatment by siRNA-Nrf2 suggested resveratrol could not activate the expression of antioxidant enzymes under a condition of inhibition of Nrf2. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that resveratrol attenuated oxidative stress to protect H2O2-induced rat ovarian granulosa-lutein cell injury and apoptosis via SIRT1/Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "Using a simulated gastrointestinal digestion model combined with a Caco-2 cell model, this study aims to assess the bioaccessibility and cellular uptake of dietary lutein, zeaxanthin, and ferulic acid from muffins and bread prepared from blends of hairless canary seed (HCS), wheat, and corn. Residual digestive enzymes damaged the Caco-2 monolayer and necessitated the requirements for the additional clean-up of the digesta. Several digesta cleanup treatments were examined, and the C18 column, along with AEBSF inhibitor, was selected as the most effective treatment. However, the cleanup treatment reduced lutein, zeaxanthin, and ferulic acid concentrations. The bioaccessibility of lutein from muffins was high at 92-94% (without clean-up) and 81-86% (with cleanup); however, the cellular uptake was low (7-9%). The bioaccessibility and cellular uptake (4-11%) of zeaxanthin were lower than lutein. Ferulic acid from muffins exhibited a wide range of bioaccessibility for non-cleanup (105-229%) and clean-up (53-133%) digesta samples; however, cellular uptake was very low (0.5-1.8%). Bread made from wheat/HCS had higher lutein bioaccessibility (47-80%) than the control bread (42%), with an apical cellular uptake ranging from 4.3 to 9.2%. Similar to muffins, the bioaccessibility of zeaxanthin from bread was lower than lutein, while ferulic acid had a fairly high bioaccessibility at 98-103% (without clean-up) and 81-102% (with cleanup); however, zeaxanthin cellular uptake was low (0.2%). These results suggest that muffins and bread could boost the daily consumption of lutein, zeaxanthin, and ferulic acid, allowing for a small portion to be absorbed in the small intestine."

However, evidences suggesting extent of reduction in functional stability of lutein on exposure to such treatment conditions are nil. This study is first of its kind, where we attempted to gain clarity on the extent of degradation caused by the changes in temperature (40-100 °C), pH (2-8) and duration of such treatments. Increase (3.9 folds) in lutein loss within an hour at 40 °C occurred when pH was lowered from 8 to 2. Increase (1.7 folds) in lutein loss at neutral pH and 40 °C occurred when duration of exposure was increased from 1 to 4 h. Besides, lutein loss significantly increased on rising the temperature by every 10 °C. The functional stability of lutein in relation to its degradation was also studied by monitoring its radical scavenging activity. While lutein is highly unstable, lutein structure and its respective bioactivity can be significantly (p < 0.05) retained (< 12.44% and > 54.87% respectively) by maintaining the operating conditions at higher pH (7-8) and lower temperatures (40-50 °C) for a short period of time (< 1 h).

      "abstract": "Chronic alcohol intake can affect both liver and intestinal barrier function. The goal of this investigation was to evaluate the function and mechanism of lutein administration on the chronic ethanol-induced liver and intestinal barrier damage in rats. During the 14-week experimental cycle, seventy rats were randomly divided into seven groups, with 10 rats in each group: a normal control group (Co), a control group of lutein interventions (24 mg/kg/day), an ethanol model group (Et, 8-12 mL/kg/day of 56% (v/v) ethanol), three intervention groups with lutein (12, 24 and 48 mg/kg/day) and a positive control group (DG). The results showed that liver index, ALT, AST and TG levels were increased, and SOD and GSH-Px levels were reduced in the Et group. Furthermore, alcohol intake over a long time increased the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β, disrupted the intestinal barrier, and stimulated the release of LPS, causing further liver injury. In contrast, lutein interventions prevented alcohol-induced alterations in liver tissue, oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, the protein expression of Claudin-1 and Occludin in ileal tissues was upregulated by lutein intervention. In conclusion, lutein can improve chronic alcoholic liver injury and intestinal barrier dysfunction in rats.",

METHODS: We divided human prostate cancer PC-3M cells into a control, a low-dose lutein, a medium-dose lutein and a high-dose lutein group, and treated them with 0, 10, 20 and 40 μmol/L lutein, respectively. Then we examined the adhesion of the cells to matrix by cell adhesion assay and the changes in cell pseudopodia by Phalloidin staining, detected the expressions of paxillin, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, recombinant tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), E-cadherin, N-cadherin and vimentin by Western blot, determined the invasiveness and migration of the cells by scratch and Transwell assays, and observed their dynamic movement by high-intension imaging. RESULTS: Compared with the control, the lutein intervention groups showed significant reduction in the number of the cells adhered to matrix, the number of cell pseudopodia, the expressions of paxillin, MMP-2, MMP-9, N-cadherin and vimentin, the rates of migration, invasion and metastasis, and the distances of displacement and movement of the cells. However, the expressions of TIMP-1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related E-cadherin were upregulated significantly. CONCLUSION: Lutein can inhibit cell adhesion, reduce the expressions of MMPs, and suppress cell invasion and migration by inhibiting the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.",

With aging, this damage accumulates within the RPE cells, causing various diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Numerous antioxidant substances are used to prevent this process in humans, including lutein. This study aims to determine the differences in the expression patterns of pyroptosis genes in senescent human retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19 exposed to lutein. Changes in the expression of pyroptosis-related genes were assessed by oligonucleotide microarrays, and the results were validated by real-time RT-qPCR. The microarray analysis showed seven transcripts were differentially expressed both in the H2O2-treated cells versus the controls and in the lutein/H2O2-treated cells compared to the H2O2-treated cells (FC > 2.0). Depending on the used lutein, H2O2, or co-treatment of ARPE-19 cells, statistically significant differences in the expression of TXNIP, CXCL8, BAX, and CASP1 genes were confirmed by the RT-qPCR (p < 0.05). A STRING database analysis showed that the proteins encoded by the analyzed genes form a strong interaction network (p < 0.001). These data indicate that lutein modulates the expression level of pyroptosis-related genes, which may be useful for the development of new methods preventing pyroptosis pathway activation in the future."

      "abstract": "A multitude of cytokines have been reported to participate in the folliculogenesis process in female. Interleukin-1 (IL-1), belonging to interleukin family, is originally identified as an important immune factor involved in inflammation response. Besides the immunity system, IL-1 is also expressed in reproductive system. However, the role of IL-1 in regulating ovarian follicle function remains to be elucidated. In the current study, using the primary human granulosa-lutein (hGL) and immortalized human granulosa-like tumor cell line (KGN) models, we demonstrated that both IL-1α and IL-1β increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production via upregulating its cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme COX-2 expression in human granulosa cells. Mechanistically, IL-1α and IL-1β treatment activated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Using the specific siRNA to knock down endogenous gene expression, we found that the inhibition of p65 expression abolished IL-1α and IL-1β-induced upregulation of COX-2 expression whereas knockdown of p50 and p52 had no effect. Moreover, our results also showed that IL-1α and IL-1β promoted the nuclear translocation of p65. ChIP assay demonstrated the transcriptional regulation of p65 on COX-2 expression. Additionally, we also found that IL-1α and IL-1β could activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway. The inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling pathway activation reversed IL-1α and IL-1β-induced upregulation of COX-2 expression. Our findings shed light on the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which IL-1 modulates the COX-2 expression through NF-κB/P65 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways in human granulosa cells.",

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction and repetitive behaviors. In this study, we assessed the effect of lutein-loaded nanoparticles on ASD-like behaviors induced by prenatal valproic acid (VPA) exposure in female offspring rats and the possible involvement of oxidative stress and apoptosis. Pregnant female Wistar rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of VPA (600 mg/kg), on the gestational day 12.5. The VPA-exposed female offspring rats were divided into two subgroups and received either lutein-loaded nanoparticles (5 mg/kg) or saline by oral gavage, for 14 days. The animals were submitted to the three-chamber test and open field to evaluate ASD-like behaviors. The hippocampus was removed for the determination of oxidative stress indicators (ROS; TBARS; SOD and Nrf2) and apoptosis biomarkers (Hsp-70; p38-MAPK; Bax and Bcl-2). The exposure to lutein-loaded nanoparticles reversed sociability deficit, social memory deficit, and anxiety-like and repetitive behaviors induced by VPA, and restored the oxidative stress indicators and apoptosis biomarkers in the hippocampus. This neurochemical effect must be associated with the reversal of ASD-like behaviors. These results provide evidence that lutein-loaded nanoparticles are an alternative treatment for VPA-induced behavioral damage in female rats and suggest the involvement of oxidative stress.",

LY-zein-alginate-PC (LYZAP) and LT-zein-alginate-PC (LTZAP) NPs yield desired properties, which exhibit sustained release and are suitable for oral administration. Interestingly, co-treatment of LYZAP + LTZAP showed better release of carotenoids instead of individual treatment at intestinal pH. Bioaccessibility, cellular uptake, and basolateral secretion of LY and LT from NPs were significantly enhanced than micellar carotenoids (dietary mode of absorption). The increased absorption of carotenoids from NPs correlated with triglyceride levels. The intestinal cell uptake of carotenoids by nanoencapsulation may be due to endocytosis, paracellular, and SRB-1 protein-mediated transport. Overall, LYZAP and LTZAP NPs possess superior properties to control the release and cellular uptake of unique or distinct carotenoids. The inclusion of alginate and phosphatidylcholine in zein-based nanoencapsulation could be a promising strategy to improve carotenoid bioavailability.",

      "abstract": "The xanthophyll carotenoid lutein has been widely used as supplementation due to its protective effects in light-induced oxidative stress. Its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory features suggest that it has a neuroprotective role as well. Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS), which plays a key role in regulating brain function. Excess accumulation of intracellular glutamate accelerates an increase in the concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neurons leading to glutamate neurotoxicity. In this study, we focused on the effects of glutamate on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells to identify the possible alterations in oxidative stress, inflammation, and iron metabolism that affect the neurological function itself and in the presence of antioxidant lutein. First, ROS measurements were performed, and then catalase (CAT) and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) enzyme activity were determined by enzyme activity assay kits. The ELISA technique was used to detect proinflammatory TNFα, IL-6, and IL-8 cytokine secretions. Alterations in iron uptake, storage, and release were followed by gene expression measurements and Western blotting. Total iron level detections were performed by a ferrozine-based iron detection method, and a heme assay kit was used for heme measurements. The gene expression toward lipid-peroxidation was determined by RT-PCR. Our results show glutamate changes ROS, inflammation, and antioxidant enzyme activity, modulate iron accumulation, and may initiate lipid peroxidation in SH-SY5Y cells. Meanwhile, lutein attenuates the glutamate-induced effects on ROS, inflammation, iron metabolism, and lipid peroxidation. According to our findings, lutein could be a beneficial, supportive treatment in neurodegenerative disorders."

      "abstract": "STUDY QUESTION: Does LH addition to FSH in vitro recover the human primary granulosa lutein cell (hGLC) sub/poor-response? SUMMARY ANSWER: A picomolar concentration of LH may recover the FSH-induced cAMP and progesterone production of hGLC from sub/poor-responder women. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Clinical studies suggested that FSH and LH co-treatment may be beneficial for the ovarian response of sub/poor-responders undergoing ovarian stimulation during ART. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: hGLC samples from 286 anonymous women undergoing oocyte retrieval for ART were collected from October 2017 to February 2021. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: hGLCs from women undergoing ovarian stimulation during ART were blindly purified, cultured, genotyped and treated in vitro by increasing concentrations of FSH (nM) ±0.5 nM LH. cAMP and progesterone levels produced after 3 and 24 h, respectively, were measured. In vitro data were stratified a posteriori, according to the donors' ovarian response, into normo-, sub- and poor-responder groups and statistically compared. The effects of LH addition to FSH were compared with those obtained by FSH alone in all the groups as well. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: hGLCs from normo-responders were shown to have higher sensitivity to FSH treatment than sub-/poor-responders in vitro. Equimolar FSH concentrations induced higher cAMP (about 2.5- to 4.2-fold), and progesterone plateau levels (1.2- to 2.1-fold), in cells from normo-responder women than those from sub-/poor-responders (ANOVA; P < 0.05). The addition of LH to the cell treatment significantly increased overall FSH efficacy, indicated by cAMP and progesterone levels, within all groups (P > 0.05). Interestingly, these in vitro endpoints, collected from the normo-responder group treated with FSH alone, were similar to those obtained in the sub-/poor-responder group under FSH + LH treatment. No different allele frequencies and FSH receptor (FSHR) gene expression levels between groups were found, excluding genetics of gonadotropin and their receptors as a factor linked to the normo-, sub- and poor-response. In conclusion, FSH elicits phenotype-specific ovarian lutein cell response. Most importantly, LH addition may fill the gap between cAMP and steroid production patterns between normo- and sub/poor-responders. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Although the number of experimental replicates is overall high for an in vitro study, clinical trials are required to demonstrate if the endpoints evaluated herein reflect parameters of successful ART. hGLC retrieved after ovarian stimulation may not fully reproduce the response to hormones of granulosa cells from the antral follicular stage. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This in vitro assay may describe the individual response to personalize ART stimulation protocol, according to the normo-, sub- and poor-responder status. Moreover, this in vitro study supports the need to conduct optimally designed, randomized clinical trials exploring the personalized use of LH in assisted reproduction.

However, the beneficial impact of L/Z administration on dyslipidemia are unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effect of oral intake of L/Z on circulating total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), as well as high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. METHODS: We electronically assessed all eligible interventional studies through different electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, ISI -Web of Science, and Cochrane library until Jun 2021. After identifying the quality of each included randomized controlled trials, they were evaluated by assessing the risk-difference between treatment and control groups by pooling available data on net change of serum LDL-C, HDL-C, and Cholesterol. RESULTS: L/Z supplementation has null effect on circulating levels of TC (WMD: -3.82 95% CI: -13.83, 6.18; I-square: 85.2%), and LDL-C (WMD: -4.54; 95% CI: -11.5, 2.48; I-square: 83.9%). In contrast, L/Z treatment could significantly increase HDL-C levels in older adults (WMD: 4.06; 95% CI: 0.64, 7.48; I-square: 50.7%). CONCLUSION: L/Z administration could be an effective treatment for improving circulating HDL-C concentration in elderly adults.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) belongs to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of growth factors. HB-EGF and its receptors, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER4, are expressed in the human corpus luteum. HB-EGF has been shown to regulate luteal function by preventing cell apoptosis. Steroidogenesis is the primary function of the human corpus luteum. Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) plays a critical role in steroidogenesis. StAR expression and progesterone (P4) production in human granulosa-lutein (hGL) cells have been shown to be upregulated by a ligand of EGFR, amphiregulin. However, whether HB-EGF can achieve the same effects remains unknown. METHODS: A steroidogenic human ovarian granulosa-like tumor cell line, KGN, and primary culture of hGL cells obtained from patients undergoing in vitro fertilization treatment were used as experimental models. The underlying molecular mechanisms mediating the effects of HB-EGF on StAR expression and P4 production were explored by a series of in vitro experiments. RESULTS: Western blot showed that EGFR, HER2, and HER4 were expressed in both KGN and hGL cells. Treatment with HB-EGF for 24 h induced StAR expression but did not affect the expression of steroidogenesis-related enzymes, P450 side chain cleavage enzyme, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and aromatase. Using pharmacological inhibitors and a siRNA-mediated knockdown approach, we showed that EGFR, HER4, but not HER2, were required for HB-EGF-stimulated StAR expression and P4 production. In addition, HB-EGF-induced upregulations of StAR expression and P4 production were mediated by the activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: This study increases the understanding of the physiological role of HB-EGF in human luteal functions. Video Abstract.",

The MNPs were synthesized and characterized using FTIR, Zeta analyzer, and SEM before performing on Chlorella sorokiniana Kh12 and Tu5. For maximum harvesting efficiency >99%, the optimal culture pH, MNPs concentration, and agitation speed were 3, 200 mg/L, and 450 rpm, respectively. Subsequently, MNPs were recovered via alkaline treatment and reused up to 5 cycles as they retained their reactivity and harvesting efficiency.

Amphiregulin (AREG) and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) are two intrafollicular factors that possess opposite functions in directing corpus luteum development and progesterone synthesis in human granulosa-lutein (hGL) cells. However, whether AREG or TGF-β1 regulates the VE-cadherin expression and subsequent angiogenesis in the human corpus luteum remains to be elucidated. Results showed that hGL cells cultured on Matrigel spontaneously formed capillary-like and sprout-like microvascular networks. Results of specific inhibitor treatment and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown revealed that AREG promoteed microvascular-like formation in hGL cells by upregulating the VE-cadherin expression mediated by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway. However, TGF-β1 suppressed microvascular-like formation in hGL cells by downregulating VE-cadherin expression mediated by the activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)5-Sma- and Mad-related protein (SMAD)2/3/4 signaling pathway. Collectively, this study provides important insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms by which TGF-β1 and AREG differentially regulate corpus luteum formation in human ovaries."

To obtain high-efficiency production of lutein from algae, the feasibility of using melatonin (MT) to increase lutein yield of Acutodesmus sp. HLGY was evaluated. Under the 7.5 μM MT treatment, the lutein content and lutein productivity were 17.44 mg g-1 and 46.50 mg L-1 d-1, which were 1.53 times those of the control. Furthermore, exogenous MT increased the transcripts of key lutein synthesis- and antioxidant enzyme-related genes. Simultaneously, the carbohydrate, protein, and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and lipid content were suppressed. More importantly, the ethylene and γ-aminobutyric acid contents were markedly increased by MT, which may be linked to the increase in lutein biosynthesis. This study proposes a valuable biotechnological approach for lutein production via a novel Acutodesmus sp. strain using MT induction and provides insights into the role of MT in promoting lutein biosynthesis.",

      "abstract": "Methylglyoxal (MGO), a cytotoxic byproduct of glycolysis, causes neuro oxidative damage and apoptosis, and plays key roles in diabetic encephalopathy (DE). The goal of this research was to evaluate the roles of lutein attenuated MGO-induced damage in PC12 cells as well as the underlying mechanisms. The findings of this study showed that lutein has a significant impact on reducing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in MGO-induced PC12 cells, which may be attributed to the increased antioxidant enzymes activity and the decreased MDA levels. Moreover, treatment with lutein also alleviated cell apoptosis and mitochondrial damage. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis showed that lutein enhanced the Bcl-2:Bax ratio, inhibited the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9, and increased the protein level of phosphorylated Akt. The network pharmacology and molecular docking prediction results suggested that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway was a potential mechanism of lutein in DE treatment. Furthermore, LY294002, a specific PI3K inhibitor, partially abolished the protective effect of lutein. These results presented that lutein attenuated oxidative damage and apoptosis triggered by MGO in PC12 cells via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Lutein is a common carotenoid dispersed in fruits and vegetables. This article confirmed a protective effect of lutein on oxidative damage and apoptosis in PC12 cells after MGO damage. These results indicated that lutein could potentially be developed as a nutraceutical or functional food in the prevention of diabetic-related neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Phytoene (PT) and phytofluene (PTF) are colourless carotenoids presents in the human diet and in blood, faeces and tissues and are biologically active. However, there is very little data on these carotenoids. This study aims to assess PT and PTF concentrations in serum from healthy Spanish normolipemic subjects (n = 101, 45-65 years) and the effect of a fruit and vegetable dietary intervention (4 weeks, n = 29) on PT and PTF concentration in serum and faeces and dietary intake. Serum and faecal concentrations were analysed by HPLC and dietary intake by 3 × 24 h recalls. PT showed higher concentrations than PTF in serum, faeces and in the dietary intake. Considering both studies, PT and PTF concentrations in serum were 0.16 ± 0.07 and 0.05 ± 0.04 µmol/L, respectively, in faeces 17.7 ± 20.3 and 6.5 ± 7.9 µg/g, respectively, and in dietary intake the median was 2.4 and 0.6 mg/p/day, respectively. Carrots and tomatoes were the major dietary contributors of these carotenoids. The dietary intervention did not cause significant variations in the PT and PTF intake or serum concentrations, but a lower concentration in faeces was observed for the fruit group (PT: p = 0.024; PTF isomer-3: p = 0.034). These data highlight the need for further research on the activities of these carotenoids in humans.",

      "abstract": "Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in granulosa cells (GCs) plays a role in pathogenesis of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) by developing oxidative stress (OS). It was shown that Sulforaphane (SFN), with known antioxidant properties, can have protective effects in different diseases through affecting the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) signaling pathway. Thus, the purpose of the current work was to examine the protective impact of SFN through the activation of the AMPK/AKT/NRF2 pathway against OS produced by H2O2 in granulosa-lutein cells (GLCs). Individuals' GLCs were obtained during ovum retrieval in intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. First, the induced OS model was created in GLCs using H2O2 exposure. To examine the protective effect of SFN against OS, the cells were cultured for 24 h in presence or absence of SFN. Eventually, the levels of intracellular ROS and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry, and genes and proteins expression levels of AMPK, AKT, and NRF2 were evaluated using qRT-PCR and western blotting. Compared to the control group, the levels of intracellular ROS and apoptosis rose dramatically in GLCs with enhanced OS. SFN therapy decreased ROS and apoptosis levels and increased the overexpression of AMPK, AKT, and NRF2 genes and proteins. This study's results revealed that SFN exposure results in the alleviation of ROS and apoptosis levels possibly through activating the overexpression of genes and proteins of AMPK, AKT, and NRF2, and exerts its protective effects against OS in GLCs.",

Although orlistat is effective for obesity, flatus with discharge, faecal urgency, oily evacuation and other allied side effects limit its usage. Thus, natural product-based drug intervention is the future of research and development of novel treatment. We synthesized and characterized total lutein oxidized products (LOPs) by exposing lutein to direct sunlight with a solar intensity of 5.89 kW h m-2 day-1 and at 31 ± 2 °C for 1-10 days. Total LOPs were analyzed on C18 and structural elucidation was carried on LCMS/MS-TOF. The pancreatic lipase inhibition kinetics was estimated. The binding effects of LOP6 (fragmented peak 6) on PPAR-γ, pancreatic lipase, pharmacokinetic properties and inhibition studies were analysed. Histological evaluation of liver and adipose tissues was performed to confirm the antiobesity effect of total LOPs. The yield of extracted lutein purified from shade-dried marigold flower petals was 6%. Total LOPs were formed on the 10th day upon exposure of lutein to direct sunlight. Total LOPs on the C18 column fragmented into eight oxidized products (LOP1 to LOP8). The total LOPs showed significant inhibition of pancreatic lipase activity with an IC50 of 1.6953 μg ml-1, and Km and Vmax of 3.05 μg and 1.19 μg s-1 respectively following mixed type of inhibition. The LOP6 [4-((1E,3E,5E)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,5,7-tetraen-1-yl)-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohex-3-enol] with an approximate molecular mass of 274.25 showed a binding energy of -5.40 kcal mol-1 with a Ki of 109.43 μM for PPAR-γ and a docking score of -5.35 kcal mol-1 with a Ki of 119.4 μM for pancreatic lipase. The IC50 of LOP6 was 11.8420 μg ml-1, and Km and Vmax were 2.519 μg and 1.294 μg s-1. The pharmacokinetic properties such as solubility, permeability, bioavailability, and topological polar surface area when tested with LOP6 were significantly better than those of lutein alone. The histological examination of the liver and adipose tissue revealed that all three doses of total LOPs were effective in alleviating the ballooning and vesicular degeneration of hepatocytes and invasion of inflammatory cells in the adipose tissue. Total LOPs and LOP6 inhibited pancreatic lipase activity in vitro. LOP6 showed a better docking score for PPAR-γ and pancreatic lipase in comparison to orlistat. Histological data showed that the total LOPs exerted antiobesity activity. Thus, LOPs might provide a novel treatment approach for obesity.",

The effects of selenium (Se), sulfur (S), and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) on lutein, glucosinolate, and phenolic accumulation were assessed in kale sprouts. Red Russian and Dwarf Green kale were chamber-grown using different treatment concentrations of Se (10, 20, 40 mg/L), S (30, 60, 120 mg/L), and MeJA (25, 50, 100 µM). Sprouts were harvested every 24 h for 7 days to identify and quantify phytochemicals. The highest lutein accumulation occurred 7 days after S 120 mg/L (178%) and Se 40 mg/L (199%) treatments in Red Russian and Dwarf Green kale sprouts, respectively. MeJA treatment decreased the level of most phenolic levels, except for kaempferol and quercetin, where increases were higher than 70% for both varieties when treated with MeJA 25 µM. The most effective treatment for glucosinolate accumulation was S 120 mg/L in the Red Russian kale variety at 7 days of germination, increasing glucoraphanin (262.4%), glucoerucin (510.8%), 4-methoxy-glucobrassicin (430.7%), and glucoiberin (1150%). Results show that kales treated with Se, S, and MeJA could be used as a functional food for fresh consumption or as raw materials for different industrial applications."

      "abstract": "An absolute interlinks between inflammation and obesity with scarce investigations on the role of lutein in inflammation-induced obesity motivated us to explore the protective mechanism of lutein on adipogenesis-mediated inflammation in vitro by culturing RAW264.7 macrophages in adipocyte conditioned medium. The RAW264 macrophage cells were cultured with adipocyte-conditioned media, and the potency of lutein on the expression of adipocyte inflammation-associated protein markers (IL-1β, MCP-1, TNF-α, IL-6, NF-κB, and IKKα/β) were analyzed by western blotting. The data revealed that lutein effectively reduces the protein levels of major inflammatory markers such as NF-κB, IL-1β, MCP-1, and TNF-α in differentiated adipocytes. Interestingly, lutein hampered inflammation in the RAW264 cells that were cultured in adipocyte-conditioned media by lowering the protein expression of IL-1β, MCP-1, and TNF-α. The blockage of inflammation by lutein in both differentiated adipocytes, and adipogenesis-induced macrophages is associated with suppression of IKK α/β phosphorylation. These data suggest that lutein potentially alters adipocyte differentiation-mediated inflammation by regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. Thus, lutein could be utilized as a potent nutraceutical agent in the management of obesity and associated inflammation. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Lutein isolated from a dietary source exhibited an inhibitory effect in adipogenesis-induced inflammations. The findings of this study authenticate the diversified prospective of lutein in regulating obesity and other inflammation-related diseases. Thus, it is understood that continuous intake of lutein-rich food or dietary intervention of lutein may reduce the risk of developing obesity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lutein has been linked with various visual performance disorders, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, previous studies evaluating the association between serum lutein and the risk of AMD showed results, and the efficacy of lutein intake in AMD patients remains unclear. METHODS: To comprehensively estimate the relationship between lutein and AMD, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by searching eligible randomized clinical trials (RCT) and case-control studies to study the association between lutein and AMD on the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Elsevier, PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) databases until April 2020. The weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was adopted as the primary effect estimate. Meta-analysis was conducted using STATA 12.0. RESULTS: Nine studies with 855 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The NOS scoring of five case-control studies ranged 5-9. For RCTs, two studies were rated with a low risk of bias, one study with a moderate risk of bias and one with a high risk of bias. The results increased significantly in macular pigment optical density (MPOD) (WMD =0.069; 95% CI: 0.040-0.098, P=0.000) among AMD patients taking lutein supplementation, while there was no difference in circulating lutein levels between AMD patients and controls (WMD =0.00; 95% CI: -0.01 to 0.00, P=0.310). Subgroup analysis suggested that the dose and duration of supplementation could significantly influence the MPOD level in AMD patients. In particular, we observed a larger increase in MPOD of AMD patients using a higher dose (20 mg/d) and longer treatment (>6 months). CONCLUSIONS: Although current evidence does not support circulating lutein as a biomarker for early screening of the high-risk AMD population, this study is the first meta-analysis to explore the relationship between lutein in blood and AMD patients. Given that lutein has a high safety profile as indicated by many studies, it is reasonable to give the current analysis result that high dose (20 mg/d) and long duration (>6 months) of lutein intake could be beneficial to AMD patients."

This study was to explore the soy protein isolate (SPI) after high-pressure homogenization (HPH) (0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 MPa) as potential lutein carriers. RESULTS: The load amount (LA) and encapsulation efficiency (EE) of the SPI-lutein nanocomplexes at a homogenization pressure of 60 MPa were the highest (2.32 mg mL-1 and 92.85%, respectively), and the average particle size and ζ-potential of the SPI-lutein nanocomplexes were 192.1 nm and -30.06 mV, respectively. The DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and hydroxyl-antioxidant activities of the complex increased from 12.4% and 23.3% to 52.7% and 61.07%, respectively, after the protein was treated with HPH. The surface hydrophobicity of the SPI and the SPI-lutein nanocomplexes increased with increasing homogenization pressure treatment. Fourier transform-infrared spectrophotometry analyses suggested that the homogenization treatments resulted in partial unfolding of the protein molecules, and the addition of lutein can also lead to the change of protein secondary structure. The fluorescence emission of SPI was quenched by lutein through the static quenching mechanism. Fluorescence experiments revealed that SPI and lutein had the strongest binding ability through hydrophobic interaction at a homogenization pressure of 60 MPa. CONCLUSION: After HPH, the combination of SPI and lutein was beneficial, and the stability of lutein also improved after the combination.

In this study, a Chromochloris zofingiensis mutant (Cz-pkg), which does not shut off its photosystem and stays green upon glucose treatment, was generated and characterized. Cz-pkg was developed by treating the algal cells with a chemical mutagen as N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and followed by a color-based colony screening approach. Cz-pkg was found to contain a dysfunctional cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). By cultivated with CO2 aeration under mixotrophy, the mutant accumulated lutein up to 31.93 ± 1.91 mg L-1 with a productivity of 10.57 ± 0.73 mg L-1 day-1, which were about 2.5- and 8.5-fold of its mother strain. Besides, the lutein content of Cz-pkg could reach 7.73 ± 0.52 mg g-1 of dry weight, which is much higher than that of marigold flower, the most common commercial source of lutein. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that in the mutant Cz-pkg, most of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of lutein and chlorophylls were not down-regulated upon glucose addition, suggesting that PKG may regulate the metabolisms of photosynthetic pigments. This study demonstrated that Cz-pkg could serve as a promising strain for both lutein production and glucose sensing study.",

The obtained results indicated lower electrolyte leakage, lower excitation pressure, and higher actual photochemical efficiency of PSII in lut2 plants exposed to combined stress compared to wt plants. This implies that lut2 is less susceptible to the applied stress conditions. The observed lower values of quantum efficiency of nonphotochemical quenching and energy-dependent component of nonphotochemical quenching in lut2 suggest that nonphotochemical quenching mechanism(s) localized within LHCII could not be involved in the acquisition of higher stress tolerance of lut2 and alternatives to nonphotochemical quenching mechanisms are involved for dissipation of excess absorbed light. We suggest that the observed enhanced capacity for cyclic electron flow and the higher oxidation state of P700 (P700 +), which suggests PSI-dependent energy quenching in lut2 plants may serve as efficient photoprotective mechanisms, thus explaining the lower susceptibility of lut2 to the combined stress treatments."

      "abstract": "Lutein and zeaxanthin belong to the xanthophyll family of carotenoids, which are pigments produced by plants. Structurally, they are very similar, differing only slightly in the arrangement of atoms. Key sources of these carotenoids include kale, savoy cabbage, spinach, broccoli, peas, parsley, corn, and egg yolks. The recommended daily intake of lutein is approximately 10.0 mg and that of zeaxanthin is 2 mg. Lutein intake in adults varies, with average intakes being 1-2 mg/day. Due to the lack of synthesis of consumption of these compounds in humans, these substances are extremely important for the proper functioning of certain organs of the body (eye, skin, heart, intestines). Eating a lot of dark leafy vegetables and some fruits can help to prevent our bodies from developing diseases. The protective effects of carotenoids are mainly related to their defense against oxidative stress and their ability to scavenge free radicals. Lutein and zeaxanthin are the only dietary carotenoids that accumulate in the retina, specifically the macula, and are called macular pigments. These carotenoids are concentrated by the action of specific binding proteins such as StARD3, which binds lutein, and GSTP1, which binds zeaxanthin and its dietary metabolite, mesozeaxanthin. It has been shown that supportive therapy with lutein and zeaxanthin can have a beneficial effect in delaying the progression of eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts. This article presents the current state of knowledge on the role of lutein and zeaxanthin, especially from human studies targeting their metabolism and bioavailability, with recommendations to consume xanthophyll-rich foods.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Growth differentiation factor-11 (GDF-11) belongs to the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily. To date, the expression of GDF-11 in the ovary and its role in regulating ovarian function are completely unknown. Ovarian granulosa cell-mediated steroidogenesis plays a pivotal role in maintaining normal female reproductive function. GDF-11 and GDF-8 share high sequence similarity and exhibit many similar features and functions. Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) regulates the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis and its expression can be downregulated by GDF-8. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of female infertility. The expression levels of GDF-8 are upregulated in the human follicular fluid and granulosa-lutein (hGL) cells of PCOS patients. However, whether similar results can be observed for the GDF-11 needs to be determined. METHODS: The effect of GDF-11 on StAR expression and the underlying molecular mechanisms were explored by a series of in vitro experiments in a primary culture of hGL cells obtained from patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. Human follicular fluid samples were obtained from 36 non-PCOS patients and 36 PCOS patients. GDF-11 levels in follicular fluid were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: GDF-11 downregulates StAR expression, whereas the expression levels of the P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) are not affected by GDF-11 in hGL cells. Using pharmacological inhibitors and a siRNA-mediated approach, we reveal that ALK5 but not ALK4 mediates the suppressive effect of GDF-11 on StAR expression. Although GDF-11 activates both SMAD2 and SMAD3 signaling pathways, only SMAD3 is involved in the GDF-11-induced downregulation of StAR expression. In addition, we show that SMAD1/5/8, ERK1/2, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways are not activated by GDF-11 in hGL cells. RT-qPCR and ELISA detect GDF-11 mRNA expression in hGL cells and GDF-11 protein expression in human follicular fluid, respectively. Interestingly, unlike GDF-8, the expression levels of GDF-11 are not varied in hGL cells and follicular fluid between non-PCOS and PCOS patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study increases the understanding of the biological function of GDF-11 and provides important insights into the regulation of ovarian steroidogenesis.",

Subsequently, the effects of these NPs on light utilization and lutein accumulation of C. sorokiniana F31 were investigated, and the RGO-TiO2 NPs treatment exhibited the higher lutein production and content than that of TiO2 and control group. As the optimal RGO-TiO2 (0.5 wt%) NPs concentration of 50 mg/L and light intensity of 211 μmol/m2/s, the supreme lutein content (15.55 mg/g), production (77.2 mg/L) and productivity (12.87 mg/L/d) were achieved. The performances are higher than most of reported values in previous study, indicated that RGO-TiO2 (0.5 wt%) NPs treatment is a promised strategy to enhance microalgal growth and lutein accumulation.",

A total of 48 male Swiss albino mice of 8∼12 weeks of age were divided into eight groups of 6 mice: mice in group 1 (G1) were considered the normal control, without treatment and without skin shaving; mice in G2 had their skins were shaved, but did not receive treatment; mice in G3 were the pathological control; mice in G4 were treated as standard (hyaluronic acid); mice in G5∼G8 were treated with low and high doses of 2 different test substances, respectively. Mice were anaesthetized and then depilatory was applied on the dorsal skin area (2 cm×2 cm) on alternate days, then UV/blue light irradiation was carried out for 15 min for 6 weeks. Collagen type 1 gene expression was determined via densitometric analysis, skin elasticity was assessed, and stratum corneum water contents were measured using a cutometer and corneometer. Skin hydration was assessed through transepidermal water loss, and several serum biochemical parameters (collagenase, hydroxyproline, hyaluronic acid, and ceramide levels) were determined to assess the skin moisturizing activity of the product. Images for assessing photoaging were considered between different groups on day 42. All these subjective parameters reached statistical significance (P<0.05) in groups treated with the proprietary lutein and rosemary formulation compared with the placebo-treated group. In conclusion, the proprietary lutein, zeaxanthin, and rosemary formulation showed better protection of skin subjected to UV irradiated skin dehydration."

SIRT1, SIRT6 and SIRT7 are involved in protection stress systems caused by OS, and they can be activated by antioxidants such as celastrol or melatonin. In this study, we evaluate SIRT1, SIRT6 and SIRT7 gene expression in cultured human granulosa-lutein (hGL) cells in response to OS inductors (glucose or peroxynitrite) and/or antioxidants. Our results show that celastrol and melatonin improve cell survival in the presence and absence of OS inductors. In addition, melatonin induced SIRT1, SIRT6 and SIRT7 gene expression while celastrol only induced SIRT7 gene expression. This response was not altered by the addition of OS inductors. Our previous data for cultured hGL cells showed a dual role of celastrol as a free radical scavenger and as a protective agent by regulating gene expression. This study shows a direct effect of celastrol on SIRT7 gene expression. Melatonin may protect from OS in a receptor-mediated manner rather than as a scavenger. In conclusion, our results show increased hGL cells survival with melatonin or celastrol treatment under OS conditions, probably through the regulation of nuclear sirtuins' gene expression."

      "abstract": "Retinitis pigmentosa is a retinal disease characterized by photoreceptor degeneration. There is currently no effective treatment for retinitis pigmentosa. Although a mixture of lutein and other antioxidant agents has shown promising effects in protecting the retina from degeneration, the role of lutein alone remains unclear. In this study, we administered intragastric lutein to Pde6brd10 model mice, which display degeneration of retinal photoreceptors, on postnatal days 17 (P17) to P25, when rod apoptosis reaches peak. Lutein at the optimal protective dose of 200 mg/kg promoted the survival of photoreceptors compared with vehicle control. Lutein increased rhodopsin expression in rod cells and opsin expression in cone cells, in line with an increased survival rate of photoreceptors. Functionally, lutein improved visual behavior, visual acuity, and retinal electroretinogram responses in Pde6brd10 mice. Mechanistically, lutein reduced the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein in Müller glial cells. The results of this study confirm the ability of lutein to postpone photoreceptor degeneration by reducing reactive gliosis of Müller cells in the retina and exerting anti-inflammatory effects. This study was approved by the Laboratory Animal Ethics Committee of Jinan University (approval No. LACUC-20181217-02) on December 17, 2018."

      "abstract": "We have earlier demonstrated that lutein effectively prevents hyperglycemia generated sustained oxidative stress in ARPE-19 cells by activating Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) signaling. Since evidence portrays an intricate connection between ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress and hyperglycemia-mediated oxidative stress, we aimed to explore the protective mechanism of lutein on hyperglycemia-induced ER stress in ARPE-19 cells. To determine the effect of lutein, we probed three major downstream branches of unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathways using western blot, immunofluorescent and RT-PCR techniques. The data showed a reduction (38%) in protein expression of an imperative ER chaperon, BiP (binding immunoglobulin protein), in glucose-treated ARPE-19 cells. At the same time, lutein pretreatment blocked this glucose-mediated effect, leading to a significant increase in BiP expression. Lutein promoted the phosphorylation of IRE1 (inositol requiring enzyme 1) and subsequent splicing of XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1), leading to enhanced nuclear translocation. Likewise, lutein activated the expression and translocation of transcription factors, ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) and ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4) suppressed by hyperglycemia. Lutein also increased CHOP (C/EBP-homologous protein) levels in ARPE-19 cultured under high glucose conditions. The mRNA expression study showed that lutein pretreatment upregulates downstream UPR genes HRD1 (ERAD-associated E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase HRD1), p58IPK (protein kinase inhibitor p58) compared to high glucose treatment alone. From our study, it is clear that lutein show protection against hyperglycemia-mediated ER stress in ARPE-19 cells by activating IRE1-XBP1, ATF6, and ATF4 pathways and their downstream activators. Thus, lutein may have the pharmacological potential for protection against widespread disease conditions of ER stress.",

      "abstract": "Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a common ophthalmological disease that decreases tear secretion and causes dryness, photophobia, pain, severe corneal rupture, and even blindness. Ocular and lacrimal gland inflammation is one of the pathological mechanisms underlying DES. Therefore, effective suppression of inflammation is a crucial strategy for the treatment of DES. Lutein, commonly found in healthy foods, has anti-inflammatory effects in corneal or retina-related cells and may be a potential therapy for DES. The addition of lutein to artificial tears (AT) as an eye-drop formulation for DES treatment in a mouse model was studied in the present work. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was used as a thickener to increase the viscosity of eye drops to prolong drug retention on the ocular surface. A WST-8 assay in human corneal epithelial cells (HCE-2) showed that a concentration of <5 μM lutein (L5) and <1% PVA (P1) maintained the cell viability at 80%. A real-time PCR showed that the inflamed human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) cocultured with L5P1 had downregulated expression of inflammatory genes such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. In a benzalkonium chloride- (BAC) induced DES mouse model, AT/L5P1 could repair damaged corneas, elevate tear secretion, increase the number of goblet cells, and inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, in the cornea. In conclusion, we demonstrate that lutein/PVA as eye drops could prolong the drug ocular retention time and effectively to decrease inflammation in DES mice. Therefore, lutein, obtained from eye drops, has a potential therapeutic role for DES."

Lutein is a natural compound that belongs to the non-vitamin A carotenoids family and has presented antitumor effects on multiple cancer types. However, the function of lutein in PDAC and the mechanisms are not reported. Here, we explored the role of lutein in PDAC progression. Bioinformatic analysis identified that lutein is correlated with PDAC. Lutein suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PANC-1 cells. The upregulated genes in PDAC patients were identified and the overlap analysis predicted BAG3 as one target of lutein. Lutein repressed BAG3 expression and bioinformatics analysis predicted the interaction between lutein and BAG3. The inhibitory effects of lutein on PANC-1 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion are reversed by overexpression of BAG3. GSEA analysis identified that cholesterol homeostasis as one of the downstream signaling pathways of BAG3. In conclusion, lutein induced an inhibitory effect on the malignant progression of PDAC by targeting BAG3/cholesterol homeostasis. Lutein may be applied as a promising candidate for PDAC therapy.",

Elevated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels or states of hCG hypersensitivity seem to promote these changes, which in up to 30% of patients produce clinical signs of hyperandrogenism. Given the self-limiting course of theca lutein cysts, which are subject to spontaneous postpartum resolution, conservative treatment is the mainstay of patient management. Described herein is a rare case of theca lutein cysts with maternal virilization that failed to regress by 9 months after childbirth. Surgical intervention was eventually undertaken, necessitated by adnexal torsion."
