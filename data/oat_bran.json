      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, the environment, and gut microbiota. The incidence of IBD is increasing globally. Previous studies have shown that interactions between diet and gut microbiota influence the pathogenesis and treatment of IBD. Proper dietary nutrition including oat and oat bran regulates chronic inflammation, which is essential for individual health, and is one of the essential factors in reducing inflammation in the body and keeping the immune system functioning properly, which plays a role in the prevention and treatment of diseases. However, the mechanism of action of whether oat and oat bran will alleviate chronic inflammation by modulating intestinal flora and metabolites remains unknown. METHODS: Therefore, in this study, we have used a mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) chronic colitis to analyze the composition of intestinal microbiota, short-chain fatty acid content, and the expression of the relevant genes. RESULTS: The results showed that diets supplemented with oat and oat bran improved intestinal barrier parameters, decreased the levels of inflammatory factors, modulated the composition of intestinal microbiota, and increased the content of short-chain fatty acids. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides strong evidence that dietary interventions with oats or oat bran may have potential applications in clinical nutrition and dietary interventions for chronic IBD.",

      "abstract": "Whole-grain foods are rich in bound polyphenols (BPs) whose health benefits were largely underestimated compared with free polyphenols. We first found that DFBP (dietary fiber with BPs from oat bran) exhibited stronger colonic antioxidant activities than DF. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that DFBP selectively changed gut microbial composition, which reciprocally released BPs from DFBP. Released polyphenols from DFBP reduced excessive colonic ROS and exhibited colonic antioxidant activities via the ROS/Akt/Nrf2 pathway revealed by transcriptome and western blot analysis. Colonic antioxidant activities of DFBP mediated by gut microbiota were next proven by treating mice with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Next, Clostridium butyricum, as a distinguished bacterium after DFBP intervention, improved colonic antioxidant capacities synergistically with DFBP in HFD-fed mice. This was explained by the upregulated mRNA expression of esterase, and cellulase of Clostridium butyricum participated in releasing BPs. Our results would provide a solid basis for explaining the health benefits of whole grains.",

In a previous study, it was found that dietary fiber (DF) supplementation can effectively reduce BP in patients with HTN. The aim of this study was to determine whether a DF supplement can lower HR in patients with HTN. (2) Methods: Seventy patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly allocated into the control group (n = 34) and the intervention group (n = 36). The regular DASH dietary care was delivered to both groups of patients. In addition, one bag of oat bran (30 g/d, containing DF 8.9 g) was delivered to the intervention group. The 24 h ambulatory heart rate was measured at baseline and 3 months. (3) Results: At 3 months, the 24 h maximum heart rate (24h maxHR) in the intervention group was significantly lower than that in the control group. After the intervention, within-group comparisons in the intervention group revealed that there were significant reductions in the 24 h average heart rate (24h aveHR), 24h maxHR, average heart rate during day time (D-aveHR), minimum heart rate during day time (D-minHR), and maximum heart rate during day time (D-maxHR). Similar differences were not found in the control group. (4) Conclusions: Dietary fiber (oat bran) supplementation might be beneficial in lowering HR in patients with HTN.",

      "abstract": "Oat bran is a nutritionally rich ingredient, but it is underutilized in semi-moist and liquid foods due to technological issues such as high viscosity and sliminess. The aim of this work was to improve the technological properties of oat bran concentrate (OBC) in high-moisture food applications by enzymatic and mechanical treatments. OBC was hydrolyzed with β-glucanase (OBC-Hyd) and the water-soluble fraction (OBC-Sol) was separated. OBC, OBC-Hyd and OBC-Sol were further microfluidized at 5% dry matter content. Enzymatic treatment and microfluidization of OBC reduced the molecular weight (Mw) of β-glucan from 2748 kDa to 893 and 350 kDa, respectively, as well as the average particle size of OBC (3.4 and 35 times, respectively). Both treatments increased the extractability of the soluble compounds from the OBC samples (up to 80%) and affected their water retention capacity. OBC in suspension had very high viscosity (969 mPa·s) when heated, which decreased after both enzyme and microfluidization treatments. The colloidal stability of the OBC in suspension was improved, especially after microfluidization. The addition of OBC samples to acid milk gels decreased syneresis, improved the water holding capacity and softened the texture. The changes in the suspension and gel characteristics were linked with reduced β-glucan Mw and OBC particle size."

      "abstract": "Water-insoluble β-glucan has been reported to have beneficial effects on human health. However, no studies have thoroughly characterized the structure and function of water-insoluble β-glucan in oat bran. Thus, the structure and effect of water-insoluble β-glucan on weight gain and lipid metabolism in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice were analyzed. First, water-insoluble β-glucan was isolated and purified from oat bran. Compared with water-soluble β-glucan, water-insoluble β-glucan had higher DP3:DP4 molar ratio (2.12 and 1.67, respectively) and molecular weight (123,800 and 119,200 g/mol, respectively). Notably, water-insoluble β-glucan exhibited more fibrous sheet-like structure and greater swelling power than water-soluble β-glucan. Animal experiments have shown that oral administration of water-insoluble β-glucan tended to lower the final body weight of obese mice after 10 weeks treatment. In addition, water-insoluble β-glucan administration significantly improved the serum lipid profile (triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels) and epididymal adipocytes size. What is more, water-insoluble β-glucan reduced the accumulation and accelerated the decomposition of lipid in liver. In conclusion, water-insoluble β-glucan (oat bran) could alleviate obesity in HFD-fed mice by improving blood lipid level and accelerating the decomposition of lipid.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Insufficient dietary fiber (DF) intake is associated with increased blood pressure (BP) and the mode of action is unclear. The intake of DF supplements by participants in previous interventional studies was still far below the amount recommended by the World Health Organization. Therefore, this study aims to explore the effect of supplementing relatively sufficient DF on BP and gut microbiota in patients with essential hypertension (HTN). METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty participants who met the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into the DF group (n = 25) and control group (n = 25). All the participants received education on regular dietary guidance for HTN. In addition to dietary guidance, one bag of oat bran (30 g/d) supplement (containing DF 8.9 g) was delivered to the DF group. The office BP (oBP), 24 h ambulatory blood pressure, and gut microbiota were measured at baseline and third month. After intervention, the office systolic blood pressure (oSBP; P < 0.001) and office diastolic blood pressure (oDBP; P < 0.028) in the DF group were lower than those in the control group. Similarly, the changes in 24hmaxSBP (P = 0.002), 24hmaxDBP (P = 0.001), 24haveSBP (P < 0.007), and 24haveDBP (P = 0.008) were greater in the DF group than in the control group. The use of antihypertensive drugs in the DF group was significantly reduced (P = 0.021). The β diversity, including Jaccard (P = 0.008) and Bray-Curtis distance (P = 0.004), showed significant differences (P < 0.05) between two groups by the third month. The changes of Bifidobacterium (P = 0.019) and Spirillum (P = 0.006) in the DF group were significant. CONCLUSIONS: Increased DF (oat bran) supplement improved BP, reduced the amount of antihypertensive drugs, and modulated the gut microbiota. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR1900024055.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes is the most common medical complication in pregnancy, and it has many side effects for the mother and the fetus. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of oat bran consumption on gestational diabetes. METHODS: This study is a randomized clinical trial that was performed on 112 women with gestational diabetes treated with diet. Participants were randomly divided into two groups of 56. Participants in both groups were given a diet for gestational diabetes. In addition to the diet, the intervention group received 30 g of oat bran daily for 4 weeks at lunch and dinner. Tests of fasting blood glucose and two-hour postprandial (2hpp) glucose were taken from both groups: before the intervention, and 2 and 4 weeks after the start of the intervention. Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software (version 22) using independent t-test, as well as Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of mean blood glucose before the intervention, while 2 and 4 weeks after the intervention, mean fasting blood glucose and two-hour postprandial (2hpp) glucose decreased significantly in the intervention group compared with the control group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, the addition of oat bran to the standard diet for pregnant women with gestational diabetes reduced fasting blood glucose and two-hour postprandial (2hpp) glucose. More detailed studies with higher sample sizes are recommended to prove the effectiveness of this valuable dietary supplement. TRIAL REGISTRATION: IRCT registration number: IRCT20191220045828N1 .

      "abstract": "Patients undergoing radiotherapy to treat pelvic-organ cancer are commonly advised to follow a restricted fiber diet. However, reducing dietary fiber may promote gastrointestinal inflammation, eventually leading to deteriorated intestinal health. The goal of this study was to evaluate the influence of dietary fiber on radiation-induced inflammation. C57BL/6J male mice were fed a High-oat bran diet (15% fiber) or a No-fiber diet (0% fiber) and were either irradiated (32 Gy delivered in four fractions) to the colorectal region or only sedated (controls). The dietary intervention started at 2 weeks before irradiation and lasted for 1, 6, and 18 weeks after irradiation, at which time points mice were sacrificed and their serum samples were assayed for 23 cytokines and chemokines. Our analyses show that irradiation increased the serum cytokine levels at all the time points analyzed. The No-fiber irradiated mice had significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines than the High-oat irradiated mice at all time points. The results indicate that a fiber-rich oat bran diet reduces the intensity of radiation-induced inflammation, both at an early and late stage. Based on the results, it seems that the advice to follow a low-fiber diet during radiotherapy may increase the risk of decreased intestinal health in cancer survivors.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this work was to evaluate the role of β-glucan molecular weight (Mw) and the presence of other carbohydrates on the physiological functionality of oat bran via an in vitro digestion study. A complete approach using three different in vitro digestion models (viscosity of the small intestine digest, reduction of bile acids and on-line measurement of gas evolution) was used to predict the physiological functionality of enzymatically modified oat bran concentrate (OBC). OBC was enzymatically treated with two β-glucanase preparations at three different levels in order to specifically decrease β-glucan Mw (Pure: purified β-glucanase) or β-glucan and other cell wall polysaccharides (Mix: commercial food-grade cell wall degrading enzyme preparation). The Mw of β-glucan in OBC was tailored to high (1000 kDa), medium (200-500 kDa) and low (<100 kDa) values. The amount of arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides varied from 0.3 to 4.7 g per 100 g of OBC when OBC was treated with the Mix enzyme at the highest dosage. When the enzymatically treated OBCs were studied in an upper gut model, a decrease in the viscosity of the digest simultaneously with the reduction of β-glucan Mw was observed. At a similar β-glucan Mw range, OBC samples treated with the Pure enzyme had lower viscosity than the samples treated with the Mix one, which also contained arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides. After enzymatic hydrolysis, the capacity of OBC to reduce bile acid was decreased regardless of the enzyme treatment used, and a positive correlation was found between β-glucan Mw and bile acid reduction (r = 0.99**). The production of colonic gases by the enzymatically treated OBC samples in an in vitro colon model showed an inverse correlation between β-glucan Mw and initial rate of gas formation (r = -0.9**), but no impact of arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides was observed. This study emphasised the complexity of factors affecting the functionality of oat components under physiological conditions and demonstrated the possibility to produce Mw-tailored oat fibre ingredients that could contribute to gut mediated health benefits.",

In addition to the control bran sample, two types of pre-treatment procedures-namely, ultrasonic bath and probe-type sonication-were performed to extract proteins, followed by hydrolysis with various proteases. Physicochemical analyses showed that Flavourzyme-hydrolysates had greater amounts of aromatic amino acids, Papain-hydrolysates low surface charges (-0.78 to -1.32 mV) compared to the others (-3.67 to -9.17 mV), and Alcalase-hydrolysates a higher surface hydrophobicity. The hydrolysates had good radical scavenging activities but, as the ultrasonic pre-treatment of the brans showed, in certain cases there was a reduction in activities of up to 22% for ROO• and HO• and 15% for O2•- radicals. In anti-diabetic tests, the maximum inhibition of α-amylase was 31.8%, while that of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 was 53.6%. In addition, the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 in NCI-H716 cells was enhanced by 11.5% in the presence of hydrolysates."

      "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most aggressive malignancies in the world. Gemcitabine (Gem), a nucleoside pyrimidine analogue, is a first-line chemotherapeutic drug for PC, but the tumor response rate of Gem is very low and resistance to Gem has emerged as a major problem in the treatment of PC. Oat bran, used as animal and human food, has been found to be beneficial to health. In this study, effects of oat bran ethanol extract (OBE) on PC cells and Gem-resistant PC cells were investigated in vitro. OBE decreased cell survival and colony forming ability of PC cells, without any cytotoxicity on the normal pancreatic cells. Flow cytometry analysis and TUNEL assay showed that the OBE reduced G1/S phase transition and induced death in PC cells through AMPK activation and downregulation of JNK. Additionally, OBE could overcome Gem resistance through reduction in RRM1/2 expression and showed synergistic effect by combinatorial treatment with Gem on Gem-resistant PC cells. Additionally, LC-MS data showed that avenacoside A was a component of OBE. Thus, this study elucidated the anti-proliferative effect of OBE and synergistic effect of OBE with Gem on PC cells and Gem-resistant cells.",

The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of oat bran on prevalence of MetS and associated disorders. METHODS: A pragmatic, randomized controlled, 6-wk nutritional trial was carried out with 154 outpatients (mean age 47.6 ± 12.6 y of age). The intervention group (n = 83) received a low-calorie diet plus 40 g/d of oat bran; the control group (n = 71) received a low-calorie diet only. MetS parameters and prevalence were calculated and compared (using two-tailed statistical tests) before and after follow-up. RESULTS: After follow-up, a significant but similar reduction was observed in MetS prevalence (40% reduction, 63% and 64.8% prevalence in intervention and control groups, respectively; P = 0.226), body mass index, body weight, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, triacylglycerides, and blood glucose levels in both groups (P < 0.05). Mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was reduced in the intervention group (43.6 ± 9.6 to 41.2 ± 9.5 mg/dL; P = 0.025), but not in the control group (44.6 ± 10.5 to 44.5 ± 12.1 mg/dL; P = 0.890). There was no significant difference in any of the variables between the groups, although the P-value for HDL-C was almost significant (P = 0.078). Calorie and dietetic fiber intake during the 6-wk period were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Daily consumption of oat bran did not potentialize the beneficial effects of a traditional low-calorie diet on the prevalence of MetS and associated disorders. Additionally, it reduced HDL-C.",

      "abstract": "Wholegrain oats are known to modulate the human gut microbiota and have prebiotic properties (increase the growth of some health-promoting bacterial genera within the colon). Research to date mainly attributes these effects to the fibre content; however, oat is also a rich dietary source of polyphenols, which may contribute to the positive modulation of gut microbiota. In vitro anaerobic batch-culture experiments were performed over 24 h to evaluate the impact of two different doses (1 and 3 % (w/v)) of oat bran, matched concentrations of β-glucan extract or polyphenol mix, on the human faecal microbiota composition using 16S RNA gene sequencing and SCFA analysis. Supplementation with oats increased the abundance of Proteobacteria (P &lt;0·01) at 10 h, Bacteroidetes (P &lt;0·05) at 24 h and concentrations of acetic and propionic acid increased at 10 and 24 h compared with the NC. Fermentation of the 1 % (w/v) oat bran resulted in significant increase in SCFA production at 24 h (86 (sd 27) v. 28 (sd 5) mm; P &lt;0·05) and a bifidogenic effect, increasing the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium unassigned at 10 h and Bifidobacterium adolescentis (P &lt;0·05) at 10 and 24 h compared with NC. Considering the β-glucan treatment induced an increase in the phylum Bacteroidetes at 24 h, it explains the Bacteriodetes effects of oats as a food matrix. The polyphenol mix induced an increase in Enterobacteriaceae family at 24 h. In conclusion, in this study, we found that oats increased bifidobacteria, acetic acid and propionic acid, and this is mediated by the synergy of all oat compounds within the complex food matrix, rather than its main bioactive β-glucan or polyphenols. Thus, oats as a whole food led to the greatest impact on the microbiota.",

      "abstract": "The persistent obesity crisis, with its increased risk for the metabolic syndrome (MetS), type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), continues to damage the health of populations globally, including children. Diets rich in the fiber provided by fruit and vegetables support good metabolic health, although few adults and children achieve the recommended daily target. Daily fiber supplementation, particularly with soluble fiber products, such as psyllium, oat bran, or a newer product such as PolyGlycopleX, may provide a convenient solution. Literature searches were conducted to identify original research articles, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses with the search terms psyllium, oat bran, PolyGlycopleX, and PGX, AND adults and children AND overweight, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Data source was Embase and PubMed from 1980 to 2017. The results show that the addition of a soluble fiber product, most notably psyllium, improves blood lipid profiles, particularly total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as glycemic response, and increases satiety, and by thus improving MetS and CVD risk factors, may augment the processes initiated by weight reduction diets. Although less studied than psyllium, the available evidence has shown that β-glucan present in oat bran has a beneficial effect on MetS and CVD risk factors, particularly blood lipids and glycemia. Early research has found PolyGlycopleX to provide similar benefits to other soluble fiber products, and suggest it may also assist with weight loss. This critical review demonstrates that soluble fiber supplements used as an adjunct to dietary and lifestyle modifications may assist with the treatment of CVD and MetS risk factors. More research is needed to further clarify the benefits of PolyGlycopleX in particular, as well as to develop safe and efficacious recommendations for fiber supplementation of all types for children in general.",

However, research regarding the impact of oat bran on nutrient utilization and intestinal functions in pigs is limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of oat bran on nutrient digestibility, intestinal microbiota, and inflammatory responses in the hindgut of growing pigs. Twenty-six growing pigs were fed either a basal diet (CON) or a basal diet supplemented with 10% oat bran (OB) within a 28 day feeding trial. Results showed that digestibility of dietary gross energy, dry matter, organic matter, and crude protein were lower in the OB group compared to the CON group on day 14, but no differences were observed between the two groups on day 28. In the colon, the relative abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) associated with Prevotella, Butyricicoccus, and Catenibacterium were higher, while those associated with Coprococcus and Desulfovibrio were lower in the OB group compared to the CON group. Oat bran decreased mRNA expression of caecal interleukin-8 (IL-8), as well as colonic IL-8, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) of the pigs. In summary, oat bran treatment for 28 day did not affect dietary nutrient digestibility, but promoted the growth of cellulolytic bacteria and ameliorated inflammatory reactions in the hindgut of growing pigs.",

Four groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were used: N group (normal chow diet), M group (dyslipidemia induced by 4-week high-fat feeding, then normal chow diet), OL group and OH group (dyslipidemia induced, then normal chow diet supplemented with 10.8% or 43.4% naked oat bran). Intervention lasted for 12weeks. Gas chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to identify serum metabolite profiles. Results confirmed the effects of oat bran on improving lipidemic variables and showed distinct metabolomic profiles associated with diet intervention. A number of endogenous molecules were changed by high-fat diet and normalized following supplementation of naked oat bran. Elevated levels of serum unsaturated fatty acids including arachidonic acid (Log2Fold of change=0.70, P=.02 OH vs. M group), palmitoleic acid (Log2Fold of change=1.24, P=.02 OH vs. M group) and oleic acid (Log2Fold of change=0.66, P=.04 OH vs. M group) were detected after oat bran consumption. Furthermore, consumption of oat bran was also characterized by higher levels of methionine and S-adenosylmethionine. Pathway exploration found that most of the discriminant metabolites were involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, biosynthesis and metabolism of amino acids, microbial metabolism in diverse environments and biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites. These results point to potential biomarkers and underlying benefit of naked oat bran in the context of diet-induced dyslipidemia and offer some insights into the mechanism exploration.",

Phenolic acids are very important compounds due to the potential treatment for a wide variety of diseases. However, there is not a general method for their separation. In this work, the conditions of pH-zone-refining counter-current chromatography, involving solvent systems, concentration of retainer and eluter, flow rate of mobile phase as well as sample pretreatment, were optimized to improve extraction efficiency and reduce separation time. Finally a general separation method for seven common phenolic acids has been established using pH-zone-refining counter-current chromatography. The separation of these phenolic acids was performed with a two-phase solvent system composed of methyl tert-butyl ether/acetonitrile/water at a volume ratio of 4.75: 0.25: 5, where 3mM trifluoroacetic acid was added to the organic stationary phase as a retainer and 3mM NH4OH was added to the aqueous mobile phase as an eluter. As a result, seven phenolic acids, including syringic acid, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid were successfully separated with the purities of 95.9%, 67.3%, 96.9%, 82.4%, 97.0%, 91.0%, and 97.2%, respectively. The established general method has been applied to the crude sample of oat bran pretreated with AB-8 resin. A total of 49.5mg of syringic acid, 109.2mg of p-coumaric acid and 184.5mg of ferulic acid were successfully purified in one run from 1.22g crude extract with the purities of 95.2%, 93.0%, and 91.8%, respectively.",

Therefore, the present study focuses on the investigation of the protective effect of oat bran extract by enzymatic hydrolysates on human dermal fibroblast injury induced by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Kjeldahl determination, phenol-sulfuric acid method, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis indicated that the enzymatic products of oat bran contain a protein amount of 71.93%, of which 97.43% are peptides with a molecular range from 438.56 to 1301.01 Da. Assays for 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity indicate that oat peptide-rich extract has a direct and concentration-dependent antioxidant activity. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay and the TdT-mediated digoxigenin-dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay for apoptosis showed that administration of H(2)O(2) in human dermal fibroblasts caused cell damage and apoptosis. Pre-incubation of human dermal fibroblasts with the Oatp for 24 h markedly inhibited human dermal fibroblast injury induced by H(2)O(2), but application oat peptides with H(2)O(2) at same time did not. Pre-treatment of human dermal fibroblasts with Oatp significantly reversed the H(2)O(2)-induced decrease of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the inhibition of malondialdehyde (MDA). The results demonstrate that oat peptides possess antioxidant activity and are effective against H(2)O(2)-induced human dermal fibroblast injury by the enhanced activity of SOD and decrease in MDA level. Our results suggest that oat bran will have the potential to be further explored as an antioxidant functional food in the prevention of aging-related skin injury.",

The resulting extracts were examined for their reducing sugar content, total phenolic content (TPC), oxygen radical scavenging absorbance capacity (ORAC), hydroxyl radical scavenging effect, superoxide scavenging activity, and ferrous ion chelating potential. The amount of reducing sugar increased form 2.0% in the control sample to 21.4% in the sample treated with four fungal beta-glucanase units/g of bran. The increase in reducing sugar was also associated with subsequent increase of other extractable compounds. The total phenolic content as measured by Folin-Ciocalteu's method ranged from 0.50 to 4.80mg of gallic acid equivalents/g of bran, whereas the ORAC values were 14.4-25.4μM of Trolox equivalents/g of bran. All the samples treated with carbohydrases had higher TPC content and higher ORAC values than the control sample (no enzyme treatment). In the hydroxyl radical scavenging assay, except for the alpha-amylase treated sample, all other samples demonstrated a greater inhibition power than the control. These results indicated that pre-treatment of oat bran with cell wall degrading enzymes (i.e. carbohydrases) is a way to increase the amount of extracted phenols as well as the antioxidant properties of oat bran samples.",

This study examined the effects of oat bran on blood lipids, hemostatic factors and energy utilization. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A double-blind, randomized crossover study in 24 adults (age 25.2±2.7 years; body mass index: 24.9±2.9 kg/m2), who completed two 2-week dietary intervention periods: low-fiber diet (control) or an oat bran (control +102 g oat bran/day) diet. Fasting blood samples were drawn before and after each period, and 3-day fecal samples were collected during the last week of each period. RESULTS: Total cholesterol decreased by 14% during the oat bran period compared with 4% during the control period (P<0.001). Non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol decreased by 16% in the oat bran period compared with 3% in the control period (P<0.01), as did total triacylglycerol (21 vs 10%, P<0.05) and very-low-density lipoprotein triacylglycerol 33 vs 9%, P<0.01). Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and factor VII (fVII) levels decreased more during consumption of oat bran compared with the control period (PAI-1: 30 vs 2.3%, P<0.01; fVII: 15 vs 7.6%, <0.001). Fecal volume and dry matter were greater when consuming the oat bran diet compared with the control (P<0.001), and energy excretion was increased by 37% (1014 vs 638 kJ/day, P<0.001); however, changes in body weight did not differ (oat bran:-0.3±0.5 kg; control: 0.0±0.7 kg). CONCLUSIONS: Addition of oat bran (6 g soluble fiber/day) to a low-fiber diet lowered total and non-HDL cholesterol, as well as hemostatic factors, and may affect energy balance through reduced energy utilization.",

      "abstract": "Viscous fibers, including beta-glucan in oat bran, favorably affect satiety as well as postprandial carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. However, effects of fiber viscosity on modulation of satiety-related gut hormone responses are largely unknown. We examined the effects of modified oat bran, with or without its natural viscosity, on sensations of appetite and satiety-related gastrointestinal (GI) hormone responses to establish the relevance of viscosity of beta-glucan in oat bran. Twenty healthy, normal-weight participants (16 female, 4 male, aged 22.6 +/- 0.7 y) ingested 2 isocaloric (1250 kJ) 300-mL oat bran beverages with low or high viscosity (carbohydrates, 57.9 g; protein, 7.8 g; fat, 3.3 g; fiber, 10.2 g) after a 12-h fast in randomized order. Viscosity of the low-viscosity oat bran beverage was reduced by beta-glucanase treatment. Blood samples were drawn before and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min after beverage consumption. The oat bran beverage with low viscosity induced a greater postprandial increase in satiety (P = 0.048) and plasma glucose (P < 0.001), insulin (P = 0.008), cholecystokinin (P = 0.035), glucagon-like peptide 1 (P = 0.037), and peptide YY (P = 0.051) and a greater decrease in postprandial ghrelin (P = 0.009) than the beverage with high-viscosity oat bran. Gastric emptying as measured by paracetamol absorption was also faster (P = 0.034) after low-viscosity oat bran beverage consumption. In conclusion, viscosity differences in oat beta-glucan in a liquid meal with identical chemical composition strongly influenced not only glucose and insulin responses, but also short-term gut hormone responses, implying the importance of food structure in the modulation of postprandial satiety-related physiology.",

In this regard, soluble fibers may have beneficial effects on the plasma lipoprotein/lipid profile. The objective of the present study was to investigate the plasma lipoprotein/lipid response to dietary fibers in overweight premenopausal women within a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Following a 2-week run-in phase, 34 premenopausal women (age: 22-53 years) were randomly assigned either to the control group (no supplement) or to the treatment group, which received 2 oat bran-enriched muffins per day (28 g/day of oat bran) during 4 weeks. RESULTS: Supplementation with oat bran had a beneficial effect on plasma HDL-C levels. Indeed, compared to the control group (n = 16), a mean increase in plasma HDL-C levels of 11.2% was observed in women eating the oat bran supplement (n = 18) (p = 0.01), whereas the total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio decreased by 7.0% (p = 0.002). Results were similar after adjustment for age, apo E genotype and weight change. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that oat bran-rich foods have beneficial effect on the metabolic profile of overweight women. Integration of these foods as part of a healthy diet may, therefore, improve the cardiovascular risk profile of women.",

METHODS: We performed a randomized, controlled, parallel-group, single-centre study in which 1,994 patients from the Wehrawald Hospital (Todtmoos, Germany) were screened and 235 met the criteria male gender, hypercholesterolemia, and overweight. All patients in the Wehrawald Hospital took part in a 4-week standardized inpatient lifestyle health program consisting of dietary intervention, increased physical activity, and health education. Caloric restriction, fat modification, and oat bran supplementation were part of the nutritional regimen within the lifestyle health program. Ninety-nine patients were randomized to a fat-modified diet with caloric restriction and a daily intake of 35-50 g oat bran and 136 patients to a fat-modified, oat bran-free diet with caloric restriction. Fifty-three male overweight but normocholesterolemic subjects were selected as controls. RESULTS: The most significant decreases in total cholesterol (-67.7 +/- 37.2 mg/dl; p < 0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-56.3 +/- 35.1 mg/dl; p < 0.01), and apolipoprotein B (-42.4 +/- 34.1 mg/dl; p < 0.01) were found with the combination of the fat-modified and oat bran enriched food. CONCLUSIONS: Added to a fat-modified diet, oat bran within a practical range of intake significantly reduces total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B. These beneficial effects occurred independent of covariables such as physical activity or caloric and fat restriction in the diet.",

Rice bran contains minimal soluble fiber, but rice bran oil has a hypolipidemic effect. Full-fat rice bran was compared with oat bran and a rice starch placebo in hyperlipidemic humans to see if it might have a role in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Moderately hypercholesterolemic (5.95-8.02 mmol/L), nonsmoking, nonobese adults were studied in a 6-wk, randomized, double-blind, noncross-over trial. Three groups added 84 g/d of a heat-stabilized, full-fat, medium-grain rice bran product (n = 14), oat bran product (n = 13) or rice starch placebo (n = 17) to their usual low-fat diet. Serum cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), apoA1 and apoB were measured before and at the end of the supplementation period. Serum cholesterol decreased significantly (P </= 0.05) by 8.3 +/- 2.4% and 13.0 +/- 1.8% in the rice bran and oat bran groups, respectively, but there was no change in the rice starch group. This change was attributable to LDL-C, which decreased by 13.7 +/- 2.8% in the rice bran group and 17.1 +/- 2.4% in the oat bran group (P </= 0.05). Serum apoB decreased proportionately. There was no consistent effect on triglycerides within each group and HDL-C and apoA concentrations did not change. The LDL-C:HDL-C ratio decreased significantly in the rice bran and oat bran groups. Stabilized, full-fat rice bran or oat bran, added to the prudent diet of hyperlipidemic adults, similarly reduced cholesterol and LDL-C and improved lipid ratios in 78% of these individuals. Rice bran, as well as oat bran, should be included in the prudent diet of individuals with hyperlipidemia.",

Therefore the effects of oat bran on the proportions of cholesterol synthesis precursors (squalene, delta(8-) cholesterol, desmosterol and lathosterol), cholestanol and plant sterols (campesterol and beta-sitosterol) to cholesterol were analysed in serum of 36 hypercholesterolaemic subjects. DESIGN: A randomized study of eight weeks duration when beta-glucan-rich oat bran (n = 20, subjects) or wheat bran (n = 16) was used as a part of a cholesterol lowering diet. Plant sterols and cholesterol synthesis precursors were analysed from frozen samples afterward. RESULTS: In the oat-bran group, but not in the wheat bran group, serum total cholesterol declined transiently. The proportions of plant sterols and cholesterol in serum, which reflect cholesterol absorption efficiency were unchanged. However, the proportions of squalene appeared to be transiently increased during the study. Subjects with apolipoprotein E 4 allele had higher serum campesterol and sitosterol levels (suggestive of efficient cholesterol absorption) than those with homozygous apolipoprotein E 3 allele. CONCLUSIONS: Since the cholesterol precursors in serum reflecting endogenous cholesterol synthesis remained almost unchanged the reduction in the serum cholesterol level by oat bran treatment can not be ascribed to an inhibition of the endogenous cholesterol synthesis.",

DESIGN: A 24-week crossover study consisting of two 12-week periods. SUBJECTS/SETTING: Eight men with NIDDM (mean age = 45 years) who lived in the community. Glucose and insulin profiles were conducted in a clinical investigation unit. INTERVENTION: Palatable, high-fiber, oat bran concentrate (soluble fiber [beta-glucan] content = 22.8%) bread products were developed. Four randomly chosen subjects ate oat bran concentrate breads first; the other subjects ate control white bread first. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dietary intake (four 48-hour dietary recalls per period) was assessed. Blood glucose and insulin (8-hour profiles) and lipid parameters after fasting were measured (at 0, 12, and 24 weeks). STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Analysis of variance and repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Total energy and macronutrient intakes were similar in both periods. Mean total dietary fiber intake was 19 g/day in the white bread period and 34 g/day (9 g soluble fiber per day from oat bran concentrate) in the oat bran concentrate period. Body weight remained stable. Mean glycemic and insulin response areas (area under the curve) were lower (P < or = .05 and not significant, respectively) for the oat bran concentrate period than the white bread period. After breakfast, area under the curve for the oat bran concentrate period was lower for glucose (P < or = .01) and insulin (P < or = .05); insulin peak was reached earlier (P < or = .05) than in the white bread period. Dietary fiber intake was correlated negatively with insulin area under the curve (P < or = .05). Mean total plasma cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were lower (P < or = .01) in the oat bran concentrate period than in the white bread period. In the oat bran concentrate period, the mean ratio of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was reduced by 24% (P < or = .05). CONCLUSIONS: The well-accepted oat bran concentrate bread products improved glycemic, insulinemic, and lipidemic responses.",

Each diet was consumed for 4 wk in random order and in a crossover fashion. Overall, the diets were high in carbohydrate (> 55% of energy) and low in fat (< 30% of energy); the amount of resistant starch in the foods containing high-amylose starch was 17 g in women and 25 g in men. The metabolic effects of specific starches on plasma lipids, fasting and postprandial glucose and insulin profiles, and bowel function were assessed at the end of each intervention. Plasma triacylglycerols (triglycerides) were significantly lower after the oat bran diet than after the other two diets (P < 0.02). No other effects on fasting plasma lipids, glucose, or insulin were noted. However, when the high-amylose starch comprised 33% of the carbohydrate content in a test meal, there was a significant but biologically small reduction in the overall postprandial plasma insulin concentration by 17% relative to the low-amylose diet (P < 0.01). Both the oat bran and the high-amylose diet resulted in an increased frequency of bowel actions and lower fecal pH (P < 0.02) relative to the low-amylose diet. However, unlike the oat bran diet, the high-amylose diet increased short-chain fatty acid concentrations in fecal water by 32% (P < 0.001).",

RESULTS: During the oat bran supplemented diet serum total cholesterol decreased by 6.2%, from 6.93 to 6.50 mmol/l (p = 0.000) and LDL cholesterol by 9.5%, from 4.64 to 4.20 mmol/l (p = 0.000). During the wash-out phase serum total cholesterol increased by 2.3%, to 6.65 mmol/l (p = 0.084) and LDL cholesterol by 5.0%, to 4.41 mmol/l (p = 0.021). The reduction in cholesterol levels on oat bran supplement correlated positively with the pre-treatment values. CONCLUSIONS: Oat bran seems to offer an additional dietary means of coping with hypercholesterolaemia.",

The subjects were initially established on a low-fat background diet (29% of energy from fat) and then 55 g low-fibre oat bran, 55 g high-fibre oat bran or 80 g mixed cooked beans were added to their diet in random order for 6 week periods. Body weight and overall composition of the diet did not change. Plasma cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were unchanged. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was significantly higher on all three intervention diets than on the lower fibre run-in diet. Supplementation of a moderately low-fat diet with palatable quantities of oat bran or beans without changing the overall fat intake does not appear to significantly lower cholesterol but may have a benefit by increasing HDL-C and reducing the ratio of LDL-C to HDL-C.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated the lipid-lowering potential of wax-matrix controlled-release forms of nicotinic acid, but questions have been raised about the risks associated with long-term use. This report describes a 38-week trial that was designed as a follow-up to a shorter 16-week clinical trial of wax-matrix controlled-release niacin. The present study also tested the hypothesis that niacin (1500 mg/d) and oat bran (56 g/d [2 oz/day]) may have a synergistic effect on improving serum lipid levels. METHODS: Ninety-eight subjects began the following protocol: oat bran alone (6 weeks), oat bran plus niacin (6 weeks), and niacin alone (32 weeks). Blood lipids, blood chemistries, nutritional variables, and side-effect profiles were monitored throughout the study. Sixty-nine (70%) subjects completed the trial taking the full dose of niacin (1500 mg/d); 8 subjects completed the trial taking a reduced dose of niacin (average 906 mg/d); 11 discontinued taking any niacin because of either intolerable side effects (n = 7) or liver enzyme abnormalities (n = 4). RESULTS: Generally, oat bran-niacin synergism was not found. Only 10% of subjects who completed the study showed greater than expected lipid improvement on combination therapy. From baseline to the end of the final phase, significant reductions (P less than .05) occurred for total cholesterol (-10%) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-16%). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol rose significantly at the end of the oat bran plus niacin phase, but returned to near baseline by the end of the study. The liver enzymes alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotransferase all showed a tendency to rise throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this 38-week trial suggest that the relatively inexpensive wax-matrix form of niacin is effective and reasonably well tolerated. Approximately 8% of subjects were unable to continue taking niacin because of side effects, and 4% discontinued taking niacin because of liver enzyme elevations. A small group of subjects (10%) experienced greater than expected lipid improvements (synergism) on combined oat-bran and niacin therapy. Liver function monitoring with long-term use of niacin is warranted.",

We have documented in the whole study population a modest, but significant reduction of serum cholesterol levels of 4.2% (p less than 0.05) at six weeks; however at nine weeks the efficacy of this regimen was less pronounced (3.2%, p = n.s.) speaking for a decreased compliance although this regimen was well tolerated and accepted. In subsets of high risk volunteers for coronary heart disease of male gender (n = 9), with hypercholesterolemia (n = 8) or essential hypertension (n = 8) the reduction of serum cholesterol levels was more consistent (5.6%, p less than 0.05) with no change in normolipemic volunteers.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite animal and metabolic ward studies that support the benefit of oat bran as a useful dietary supplement for the lowering of cholesterol, there have been few controlled studies on free-living subjects that have convincingly demonstrated this benefit. METHODS: This is a report of a randomized, controlled, blinded clinical trial with a crossover design using oat bran (28 g [1 oz] twice daily) vs wheat cereal as a supplement to a fat-modified diet for the reduction of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The study included male and female subjects aged 20 to 70 years, with baseline LDL cholesterol in the 50th to 95th percentile. All subjects were instructed in the American Heart Association Step I (AHA-I) diet, and eating behavior was monitored using 4-day food records during each study period. RESULTS: Eighty-two percent (n = 145) of the total number of subjects who were randomized to treatment groups completed the study. Blood lipid studies demonstrated significantly greater reductions in total cholesterol (average -2.2%) and LDL cholesterol (average -3.9%) in the oat-bran groups than in the wheat-cereal groups (average total cholesterol +3.3%, average LDL cholesterol +4.0%) or in the diet alone group (total cholesterol +6.0%; LDL cholesterol +6.4%). All groups did comparably well at adhering to the AHA-I diet; however, dietary factors alone, when analyzed by the Keys equations, could not explain the group differences in lipid change. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of oat bran (28 g [1 oz] twice daily) to the AHA-I diet provided significant added benefit in lowering total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in most hypercholesterolemic subjects. Analysis for factors that predict LDL cholesterol response to oat bran revealed a significant age-by-sex interaction (P less than .001). Women under the age of 50 years, as a group, showed essentially no increased benefit from the addition of oat bran to their diet. Cholesterol levels in older women appear to be significantly more responsive to a modified diet containing oat bran than those of younger women.",

To determine the hypocholesterolemic response of beta-glucan in the diet, 156 adults with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels above 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) or between 3.37 and 4.14 mmol/L (130 and 160 mg/dL) with multiple risk factors were randomized to one of seven groups. Six groups received either oatmeal or oat bran at doses (dry weight) of 28 g (1 oz), 56 g (2 oz), and 84 g (3 oz). A seventh group received 28 g of farina (beta-glucan control). At week 6 of treatment, significant differences were found for both total cholesterol and LDL-C levels among the farina control and the treatment groups who were receiving 84 g of oatmeal, 56 g of oat bran, and 84 g of oat bran, with decreases in LDL-C levels of 10.1%, 15.9%, and 11.5%, respectively. Fifty-six grams of oat bran resulted in significantly greater reductions in LDL-C levels than 56 g of oatmeal. Nutrient analysis shows no difference in dietary fat content between these treatment groups; therefore, the higher beta-glucan content of oat bran most likely explains the significantly greater LDL-C reductions. A dose-dependent reduction in LDL-C levels with oat cereals supports the independent hypocholesterolemic effects of beta-glucan.",

Seventy-one free-living men and women with hypercholesterolemia (serum cholesterol greater than 75th percentile) were randomly assigned to one of the following four groups: low-fat, low-cholesterol diet (LFLC); low-fat, low-cholesterol diet plus 50 gm/day oat bran (LFLC + OB); 50 gm/day oat bran supplemented diet (OB); or 42.5 gm/day processed oat bran (ready-to-eat cereal containing beta-glucan concentrated from oat bran) (POB). Subjects assigned to regimens OB and POB were requested to add the oat supplement without making additional changes in their diet. Serum cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol analyses were performed at 4-week intervals, and diet records were assigned and analyzed. All groups experienced significant decreases in cholesterol from original levels (p less than .05). The average decrease in total serum cholesterol varied from 10% to 17%, with no significant differences among the four groups. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations decreased in all groups except group 4, in which there was a slight increase; however, no differences were found between groups. Energy, fat, and cholesterol intakes decreased in all groups, suggesting that displacement of higher fat foods from the diet may be one of the many mechanisms whereby oat supplements lower serum cholesterol. In addition, all groups reduced their intakes of calcium, copper, folic acid, and potassium from marginal levels at the beginning of the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Based on these recommendations and previous studies suggesting a hypocholesterolemic effect of oat bran dietary supplementation, 16 family practice outpatients with elevated cholesterol levels were enrolled in a 12 week study designed to assess the practicality and effectiveness of adding four oat bran muffins per day to the diet. Subjects were randomized into immediate intervention and delayed intervention groups. The combined group had a significant decrease in total cholesterol of 7.9 percent (p less than .03) and in LDL-cholesterol of 10.1 percent (p less than .03) but there was no significant difference with respect to lipid changes between the immediate group and the delay group when the delay group was serving as a control for the immediate group. The results taken in conjunction with evidence in the literature indicate that the simple addition of oat bran muffins to the diet of certain family practice outpatients is well tolerated and probably effective in lowering serum total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol.",

      "abstract": "To evaluate selected metabolic effects of plant fibers, we fed control and oat-bran diets in an alternating sequence to eight men with previously documented hypercholesterolemia. The two solid diets differed only in the inclusion of 100 g of oat bran in the test diet. We randomized diet sequences and the measured intakes of carbohydrate, protein, fat, and cholesterol were virtually identical on the two diets. Serum total cholesterol concentrations were stable on control diets whereas a progressive reduction was observed in seven men on oat-bran diets. On oat-bran diets, average reductions in serum total cholesterol concentrations were 13% (p less than 0.01, N = 8); plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were 14% lower (p less than 0.05) while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were not changed. Fasting and postprandial serum glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentrations were similar on the two diets. Fecal excretion of total bile acids was 54% higher (p less than 0.001) on oat-bran diets than on control diets but neutral steroid excretion was slightly lower while on oat bran. Palatable and inexpensive high-fiber foods such as oat bran may have a role in the treatment of certain patients with hypercholesterolemia.",
