      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Premenstrual syndrome and menstrual symptoms adversely affect approximately 80-95% of women of reproductive age. Aromatherapy interventions are used to reduce premenstrual syndrome and menstrual symptoms. This study was conducted to determine the effect of aromatherapy intervention with bergamot and grapefruit essential oils on premenstrual syndrome and menstrual symptoms. METHODS: Ninety women with premenstrual syndrome were included the study. Participants were randomly divided into 3 groups: Bergamot(n = 30), Grapefruit(n = 30), Placebo(n = 30). Participants in each group were made to smell pure essential oil for 30 min 3 times a day for 4 days during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The used was repeated in 3 menstrual cycles. \"Premenstrual Syndrome Scale (PMSS)\" was used to evaluate premenstrual syndrome and \"Menstrual Symptom Questionnaire (MSQ)\" was used to evaluate menstrual symptoms. All measurements were performed before and after the study. RESULTS: The results showed that grapefruit essential oil was effective in reducing PMSS total score (p = 0.010) and sub-scale scores (depressive affect, anxiety, fatigue, depressive thoughts, appetite changes, sleep changes and bloating (p < 0.001), irritability (p = 0.024), pain (p = 0.047)). Although grapefruit essential oil had no effect on the total score of the MSQ. Grapefruit essential oil was found to be effective in reducing the MSQ scale sub-scale scores (menstrual pain symptoms (p = 0.024) and the use of coping methods with menstrual pain (p = 0.011)). Bergamot essential oil was found to be effective in reducing PMSS total score (p = 0.001) and PMSS sub-scale scores depressive affect (p = 0.013), irritability (p = 0.034), depressive thoughts and appetite changes (p = 0.026), pain (p = 0.001)). In addition, there was no effect on the menstrual syndrome scale and its sub-dimensions (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Grapefruit essential oil was effective in reducing both premenstrual syndrome and menstrual symptoms, whereas bergamot essential oil was only effective in reducing premenstrual symptoms.

      "abstract": "This study aims to explore the effects of hydrothermal treatment (HT)-assisted grapefruit peel pectin on the physicochemical, morphological, thermal, and pasting characteristics and in vitro digestibility of corn starch under varying temperatures and moisture content. Morphological analysis revealed that pectin uniformly coated starch granules, forming protective layers and rearranging crystalline structures. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance confirmed alterations in molecular order, with increases in single-helix structures and reductions in double-helix structures. X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry highlighted significant reductions in crystallinity and changes in thermal properties, indicating compact structural arrangements. Pasting and in vitro digestibility results revealed HT-C/P@60/80 exhibiting the highest resistant starch content and the lowest rapidly digestible starch content. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations demonstrated that pectin binds to α-amylase, then potentially inhibiting its catalytic activity. These findings highlight the role of pectin in altering starch properties for better food applications."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Coumarins are known to have antidiabetic properties. They are also known to have direct effects on the cardiovascular system. However, their insulin and amylin-releasing effects have not been thoroughly studied. This study investigated the effect of 5,7-dimethoxycoumarin (Citropten) fractions in grapefruit peel on insulin and amylin secretions in normal male Wistar rats. METHODS: Methanol extract from grapefruit peels was fractionated using vacuum-assisted liquid chromatography with n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol. Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry analysis reported ethyl acetate fraction with the highest concentration (85.66%) of 5,7-dimethoxycoumarin. Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test was performed on 5 sets of 5 rats receiving intraperitoneally: 1) negative control, 1 ml of sterile water 2) positive control, 0.2 mg/kg glimepiride, 3) ethyl acetate fraction containing 20 mg/kg 5,7-dimethoxycoumarin, 4) methanol fraction containing 20 mg/kg 5,7-dimethoxycoumarin, 5a) 1 ml 0.6% hydrogen peroxide and 20 mg/kg 5,7-dimethoxycoumarin; 5b) 1 ml 6% hydrogen peroxide and 20 mg/kg 5,7-dimethoxycoumarin; and 5c) 1000 mg/kg Vitamin C and 20 mg/kg 5,7-dimethoxycoumarin. RESULTS: Results showed that ethyl acetate fraction containing 20 mg/kg 5,7-dimethoxycoumarin had comparable plasma glucose control as obtained with glimepiride, with indirect insulin secretion effect unlike direct-acting glimepiride; the methanol fraction was less effective. An oral Glucose Tolerance Test confirmed the antidiabetic efficacy of 5,7-dimethoxycoumarin. Both ethyl acetate and methanol fractions of 5,7-dimethoxycoumarin induced extrapancreatic amylin synthesis and secretion. CONCLUSION: 5,7-dimethoxycoumarin will find special applications in the management of obesity and for people with diabetes having chronic complications. Since the overall plasma glucose regulation is achieved through amylin and insulin synergy, attention should be shifted from insulin-based to amylin-based therapy. There is a need to focus on natural compounds that stimulate extrapancreatic amylin release, especially in patients with type 1 diabetes who are insulin dependent.",

This study aimed to evaluate the ameliorating effect of topical application of hyaluronic acid (HA) with or without grapefruit seed extract (GFSE) (5, 10, and 15 wt %) in induced periodontitis in rats. METHODS: Surgical alveolar bone defects were created in 30 adult male Wistar rats, followed by the introduction of a ligature impregnated with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide for four weeks to induce periodontitis. Rats were distributed into five groups (n = 6); an untreated periodontitis group and four treated groups in which gel (HA±GFSE) was injected into the sulcus once weekly for two weeks. All rats were euthanized six weeks after starting the experiment, and the mandibles were prepared for histopathological and histomorphometric analyses. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for measuring tissue levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) enzyme. RESULTS: HA enhanced new bone formation at defect margins, thereby diminishing defect width. This effect significantly increased as HA was combined with GFSE in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the HA and GFSE mixture suppressed the tissue levels of TNF-α and TGF-β1, thereby increasing PON-1. CONCLUSION: The HA and GFSE mixtures exhibited synergistic therapeutic potential for the treatment of chronic periodontitis in a dose-dependent manner.",

Cryptococcus laurentii can stimulate the fruit defence system, whereas the use of antagonistic yeast alone demonstrates limited efficacy. This study investigated the molecular mechanisms of C. laurentii cultured with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMCC. laurentii), and evaluated the effects of CMCC. laurentii on phenylpropane and reactive oxygen metabolism in grapefruit fruit. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the upregulation of gene expression associated with yeast growth and antagonistic ability occurred in CMCC. laurentii after 72 h cultivation. Meanwhile, CMCC. laurentii reduced lesion diameter and disease incidence in fruit. This treatment promoted phenylpropane metabolism by activating PAL, C4H, 4CL, POD, and PPO and increasing the secondary metabolites. CMCC. laurentii also activated the AsA-GSH cycle, enhanced the activities of SOD and CAT, and reduced the accumulation of H2O2 and O2•-. The results suggested that CMCC. laurentii maintained high postharvest fruit quality in grapefruit fruit by elevating the phenylpropane and reactive oxygen metabolism.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is a large body of preclinical data implicating that grapefruit juice (GJ) inhibits many CYP 450 isoforms. The potential of GJ-to-drug is of high relevance to clinical psychiatry, because a wide range of psychotropic medicines undergo CYP 450 metabolism and P-gp transport. AREAS COVERED: Relevant data were identified by searching the electronic databases up to February 2024. This work constitutes a summary of preclinical and clinical data on GJ impact on CYP 450 metabolism, P-glycoprotein, and organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs), with focus on studies that assessed GJ-to-psychotropic drug interactions. Additionally, an unpublished case series of nine patients is provided. EXPERT OPINION: The impact of GJ on CYP 3A4 appears to be the critical mechanism for the majority of GJ-to-psychopharmacotherapy interactions described in human studies or case reports. However, there are studies and cases of patients clearly showing that this is not the only route explaining the GJ effect, and at times, this particular is of no relevance and that other CYP 450 isoforms as well as drug transporting proteins might be involved. The risk of GJ-to-psychotropic drugs needs to be further evaluated in a 'real-world' setting and apply not only measures of pharmacokinetics but also treatment effectiveness and safety.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we investigated the beneficial effects of grapefruit IntegroPectin, derived from industrial waste grapefruit peels via hydrodynamic cavitation, on microglia cells exposed to oxidative stress conditions. Grapefruit IntegroPectin fully counteracted cell death and the apoptotic process induced by cell exposure to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBH), a powerful hydroperoxide. The protective effects of the grapefruit IntegroPectin were accompanied with a decrease in the amount of ROS, and were strictly dependent on the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt cascade. Finally, IntegroPectin treatment inhibited the neuroinflammatory response and the basal microglia activation by down-regulating the PI3K- nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB)- inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) cascade. These data strongly support further investigations aimed at exploring IntegroPectin's therapeutic role in in vivo models of neurodegenerative disorders, characterized by a combination of chronic neurodegeneration, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.",

      "abstract": "As the prevalence of vascular calcification (VC), a strong contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, continues to increase, the need for pharmacologic therapies becomes urgent. Sodium thiosulfate (STS) is a clinically approved drug for therapy against VC; however, its efficacy is hampered by poor bioavailability and severe adverse effects. Plant-derived extracellular vesicles have provided options for VC treatment since they can be used as biomimetic drug carriers with higher biosafety and targeting abilities than artificial carriers. Inspired by natural grapefruit-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), we fabricated a biomimetic nanocarrier comprising EVs loaded with STS and further modified with hydroxyapatite crystal binding peptide (ESTP) for VC-targeted delivery of STS. In vitro, the ESTP nanodrug exhibited excellent cellular uptake capacity by calcified vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and subsequently inhibited VSMCs calcification. In the VC mice model, the ESTP nanodrug showed preferentially the highest accumulation in the calcified arteries compared to other treatment groups. Mechanistically, the ESTP nanodrug significantly prevented VC via driving M2 macrophage polarization, reducing inflammation, and suppressing bone-vascular axis as demonstrated by inhibiting osteogenic phenotype trans-differentiation of VSMCs while enhancing bone quality. In addition, the ESTP nanodrug did not induce hemolysis or cause any damage to other organs. These results suggest that the ESTP nanodrug can prove to be a promising agent against VC without the concern of systemic toxicity.",

We tested the ability of grapefruit-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) to inhibit the growth of human leukemic cells and leukemic patient-derived bone marrow blasts. Transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) showed that the obtained EVs were homogeneous exosomes, defined as exosome-like plant-derived nanovesicles (ELPDNVs). The analysis of their content has shown measurable amounts of several molecules with potent antioxidant activity. ELPDNVs showed a time-dependent antiproliferative effect in both U937 and K562 leukemic cell lines, comparable with the effect of high-dosage ascorbic acid (2 mM). This result was confirmed by a clear decrease in the number of AML blasts induced by ELPDNVs, which did not affect the number of normal cells. ELPDNVs increased the ROS levels in both AML blast cells and U937 without affecting ROS storage in normal cells, and this effect was comparable to ascorbic acid (2 mM).

The process parameters include sonication pre-treatment time (5-10 min), xanthan-gum-based edible coating (0.1%-0.3%, w/w), and sucrose concentration (20-50 Brix), were examined and optimized for osmosis dehydration of grapefruit slices. At each step, three grapefruit slices were immersed in an ultrasonic water bath at 40 kHz, 150 W, and 20 C. Then, the sonicated slices were placed in a container contain sucrose and xanthan, and the container was put in a 50 C water-bath for 1 h. The optimum concentration of xanthan gum, sucrose, and time of treatment were predicted to be 0.15%, 20.0 Brix, and 10.0  min, respectively. Under this optimum condition, estimated values of response variables are as follows: weight reduction 14.14%, moisture loss 25.92%, solids gain 11.78%, rehydration ratio 203.40%, and shrinkage 2.90%. The weight reduction and moisture loss increased when the sonication time and sucrose concentration increased. Results demonstrated that the experimental data could be adequately fitted into a linear model with p-value ranging from 0.0001 to 0.0309 for all the variables examined. The rehydration of dried samples increased when xanthan concentration increased. Also, the weight reduction, moisture loss, sucrose absorption, and shrinkage declined with increasing in the xanthan levels.",

      "abstract": "Chronic inflammation is linked to the development of numerous diseases and is accompanied by increased cytokine secretion. Macrophages provide a first line of defense against pathogens that under inflammatory stimuli release pro-inflammatory cytokines. The essential oil (EO) fractions obtained from Citrus spp. rich in different compounds have gained the attention of both researchers and users during the last decades. In particular, grapefruit (Citrus paradisi) peel is rich in phenolics and flavonoids with several health benefits, including anti-inflammatory actions. Additionally, its EO consists of a large number of compounds such as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, and oxides. Among the methods for encapsulating EOs, spray-drying is the main one. In the present study, we aimed to determine the in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of EO from C. paradisi (grapefruit essential oil [GEO]) (whole and fractions) in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation model. Results indicate that Fr-GEO and Fr-GEO_SD exert protective effects against LPS-induced inflammation by decreasing gene expression and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines as IL-6 and TNF-α. Monoterpenes as the most common components, as well as aldehydes and sesquiterpenes, might be responsible for such effects, although a synergistic action is not excluded. Furthermore, a higher percent of aldehydes is linked to improved olfactory properties. Our findings support the anti-inflammatory effects of selected Fr-GEO with a great potential for the development of new nutraceuticals and/or functional food for the treatment of inflammatory-associated diseases. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The findings of this study support the anti-inflammatory effects of selected Fr-GEO with a great potential for the development of new nutraceuticals and/or functional food for the treatment of inflammatory-associated diseases.",

Candida albicans is the most common opportunistic pathogenic fungus of humans, colonizing in the genital and intestinal mucosa, skin, and oral-nasal cavity and reducing quality of life. Herein, essential oil from grapefruit (Citrus paradise) peels was obtained by hydrodistillation, and the remaining plant material was sequentially subjected to supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) extraction to determine the conditions for maximizing phenolic compounds. A statistical design was used to evaluate the effect of temperature (30, 50, 70 °C), pressure (80, 150, 220 bar), and ethanol as a cosolvent (0%, 10%, and 20% v/v). Essential oil and SC-CO2 extracts were mixed at various ratios to develop an effective antifungal formulation. Subsequently, fungal infection was modeled by coculturing C. albicans with human skin keratinocytes (HaCaT) to mimic dermal mycoses, endothelial cells (HUVEC) to evaluate vascular fate, and cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells to represent additional genital mycoses. Treatment with essential oil and extract (25:75%) formulation for 8 h exhibited slight cytotoxicity toward HeLa cells, no toxicity toward HaCaT and HUVECs, whereas inhibition of C. albicans. Considering the clinical significance, such in vitro models are essential to screen potential compounds for the treatment of opportunistic fungal infections."

In this study, we performed the regime with azacitidine, low-dose venetoclax, and grapefruit juice on an unfit AML patient with TP53 mutation. The peak venetoclax concentration (Cmax) and side effects on the patient were also monitored. The patient achieved complete remission with the venetoclax Cmax within the effective concentration range (1,000-3,000 ng/ml) and maintained durable remission until recently. Febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and pneumonia appeared during the first cycle and were recovered by stimulating agents and antibiotic treatment. This improvement combination approach by drug-food interaction may enlighten other similarly patients with AML, especially those in low-middle income countries."

A cost-effective alternative to address the multiple pollution is urgently needed. This study investigated the synergy of grapefruit peel biochar (BC) and strain AL-6 to remediate Mn2+ and NH4+-N in sequencing batch bioreactor (SBR) and soil column. The results showed that, in SBR, under the condition of C/N 5, temperature 30°C, BC and strain AL-6 showed fabulous performance to remove Mn2+ (99.3%) and NH4+-N (97.7%). The coexisting ions Mg2+ and Ca2+ had no effects on the removal of Mn2+ and COD, however, 23.3% removal efficiency of NH4+-N was curtailed. Characterization found that the presence of MnCO3 confirmed the adsorption of Mn2+ by functional groups action, and gas chromatography indicated that BC and strain AL-6 promoted the reduction of N2O and organic carbon. In addition, BC and strain AL-6 helped to immobilize 799.41 mg L-1 of Mn2+ and 320 mg L-1 of NH4+-N after 45 d in the soil column. And the determination of TOC, CEC, pH, Eh, soil enzymatic activity (catalase and urease), and microbial diversity and abundance confirmed that BC and strain AL-6 increased the soil fertility and bioavailability of pollutants. Totally, BC and strain AL-6 possess great potential to remediate Mn2+ and NH4+-N pollution in water and soil.",

We used an Agilent Poroshell column, which is characterized by a stationary phase based on non-porous core particles. With a remarkable improvement in the number of theoretical plates and low column backpressure. In addition, the developed method was employed in studying the potential food-drug interaction of grapefruit juice (GFJ) with the selected drugs which affects their pharmacokinetics in rats. The LC-MS/MS operated in positive and negative ionization mode using two internal standards: moxifloxacin and chlorthalidone, respectively. Liquid- liquid extraction of the cited drugs from rat plasma was accomplished using diethyl ether: dichloromethane (70:30, v/v). The analytes were separated using methanol: 0.1 % formic acid in water (95: 5, v/v) as a mobile phase in isocratic mode of elution pumped at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. A detailed validation of the bio-analytical method was performed in accordance with US-FDA and EMA guidelines. Concerning the in vivo pharmacokinetic study, the statistical significance between the results of the test groups receiving GFJ along with the cited drugs and the control group was assessed demonstrating that GFJ increased the plasma concentration of azithromycin, apixaban, and dexamethasone. Accordingly, this food-drug interaction requires cautious ingestion of GFJ in patients using (SARS-CoV-2) medications as it can produce negative effects in the safety of the drug therapy. A potential drug-drug interaction is also suggested between those medications requiring a suitable dose adjustment."

      "abstract": "Light, a crucial environmental signal, is involved in the regulation of secondary metabolites. To understand the mechanism by which light influences carotenoid metabolism, grapefruits were bagged with four types of light-transmitting bags that altered the transmission of solar light. We show that light-transmitting bagging induced changes in carotenoid metabolism during fruit ripening. Compared with natural light, red light (RL)-transmittance treatment significantly increases the total carotenoid content by 62%. Based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), 'blue' and 'turquoise' modules are remarkably associated with carotenoid metabolism under different light treatment (p < 0.05). Transcriptome analysis identifies transcription factors (TFs) bHLH128, NAC2-like/21/72, MYB-like, AGL11/AGL61, ERF023/062, WRKY20, SBPlike-7/13 as being involved in the regulation of carotenoid metabolism in response to RL. Under RL treatment, these TFs regulate the accumulation of carotenoids by directly modulating the expression of carotenogenic genes, including GGPPS2, PDS, Z-ISO, ZDS2/7, CRTISO3, CYP97A, CHYB, ZEP2, CCD1-2. Based on these results, a network of the regulation of carotenoid metabolism by light in citrus fruits is preliminarily proposed. These results show that RL treatments have great potential to improve coloration and nutritional quality of citrus fruits.",

      "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori infection is the most common cause of gastritis and gastric ulcers. Considering the severe side effects of current antibiotic therapies, it is crucial to find an alternate treatment for H. pylori infection. In this study, we investigated the anti-H. pylori effects of a newly isolated strain of Lactobacillus plantarum (pH3A), monolaurin, grapefruit seed extract (GSE), and their synergies in vitro and in vivo. Monolaurin and GSE suppressed H. pylori growth and urease activity at a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 62.5 ppm. Live cells and cell-free culture supernatant (CFCS) of L. plantarum pH3A with or without pH adjustment also significantly inhibited H. pylori growth. Although synergy was not observed between monolaurin and GSE, the addition of CFCS significantly enhanced their anti-H. pylori activities. Moreover, L. plantarum pH3A significantly decreased the ability of H. pylori to adhere to AGS cells and interleukin (IL)-8 production in the H. pylori-stimulated AGS cell line. The addition of GSE or monolaurin strengthened these effects. In the in vivo study, H. pylori colonization of the mouse stomach and total serum IgG production were significantly reduced by L. plantarum pH3A treatment, but the addition of monolaurin or GSE did not contribute to these anti-H. pylori activities. Therefore, the L. plantarum pH3A strain can potentially be applied as an alternative anti-H. pylori therapy, but evidence of its synergy with monolaurin or GSE in vivo is still lacking.",

However, fruit juice-drug interactions between BRX and GFJ, PJ and TJ have not been studied extensively. The present study describes the influence of GFJ, PJ and TJ on the pharmacokinetic parameters of BRX in rats. The study samples were analyzed using a mass-accurate and single-step bioanalytical method by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry over a wide calibration range of 20-1,500 ng/ml. The results of the pharmacokinetic study denoted that the combined administration of GFJ and PJ could increase systemic exposure of BRX. The area under the curve of BRX increased 3.43- and 1.88-fold with co-administration of GFJ and PJ, respectively, while TJ with BRX had no effect on the area under the curve. Time to peak concentration and half-life were not significantly changed by any juice co-administration. The results show that GFJ and PJ affect the pharmacokinetic profile of BRX and hence advice needs to be given to patients.",

      "abstract": "The effects of Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (CRP) and grapefruit juice (GFJ) on the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole were investigated in this study. Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with CRP decoction or GFJ for 28 consecutive days. After a single intragastric administration of 6.0 mg/kg, the concentration of omeprazole in the plasma was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by Kinetica software 5.0. A high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-Q-TOF-MS) method was established to identify the chemical components in CRP decoction and GFJ. The results showed that the AUCt-∞ was significantly increased when coadministrated with CRP. The AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ was remarkably increased; the Cl was decreased when coadministrated with GFJ. A total of 31 and 28 bioactive compounds were identified in the CRP decoction and GFJ, respectively. Flavonoids and furanocoumarins, including hesperidin, hesperetin, naringenin, sinensetin, tangeretin, nobiletin, and 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin, were simultaneously identified in CRP decoction and GFJ. This study indicates that the increased bioavailability of omeprazole may be due to the inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, and the systemic exposure should be monitored when concomitant administration with CRP and GFJ. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (CRP) has been widely consumed as a daily condiment, functional food, and a traditional Chinese medicine. Omeprazole, primary metabolized by CYP450 enzymes, was usually coadministered with CRP for the treatment of gastrointestinal disease. Studies have confirmed that much fruit juices, including grapefruit juice, may affect drug metabolism enzymes. CRP and grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macf.) belong to the genus Citrus and family Rutaceae with different species. Therefore, the pharmacokinetic interaction of CRP decoction and grapefruit juice with omeprazole is worthy of attention. The results of this study can provide basic pharmacological data support for the safe and effective clinical use of omeprazole. It can also provide a theoretical basis for the development of new functional products and daily application of CRP.",

      "abstract": "Due to the prevalence of individuals suffering from chronic wounds, developing safe and effective wound care agents are one of the more prominent fields of research in biology. However, wound healing is a complex, multi-stage biological process, involving multiple sequences of biological responses from different types of cells, secreted mediators, and extracellular matrix elements. Plants have a long history of use in the treatment of wounds. Plant-derived extracellular vesicles, which are secreted nano vesicle messengers responsible for intercellular communications, show promise as a new, biotechnological wound-care agent. In this study, we assessed the wound healing potential of extracellular vesicles isolated from grapefruits - a plant with well-known anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties. Grapefruit extracellular vesicles (GEVs) increased cell viability and cell migration while reducing intracellular ROS production in a dose-dependent manner in HaCaT cells. Expression of proliferation and migration-related genes were raised by GEV treatment in a dose dependent manner. Additionally, GEV treatment increased the tube formation capabilities of treated HUVEC cells. These findings suggest that GEVs can be used as plant-derived wound healing agents, and have shown potential as a biotechnological agent for wound healing. Further development and study of plant-derived extracellular vesicles may lead to the realization of their full potential.",

The results indicate that both C. laurentii and the CMC treatment suppressed P. digitatum conidia germination. In addition, C. laurentii growth in vitro was not affected by low CMC concentrations, nevertheless, the biofilm of C. laurentii was enhanced. Compared with the control fruit, the grapefruit had a lower green mould in all treatments. Significantly synergistic effects were caused by combining C. laurentii and CMC on minimum decay incidence and lesion diameter. Combined treatment induced defence enzyme activities, including chitinase, β-1,3-glucanase, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, together with disease tolerance-associated total phenol. Also, this combination inhibited the pathogen growth by adhered to the hyphae and reduced its infection in fruit wounds. Moreover, the commercial quality parameters in the combined treatment of C. laurentii and CMC, including weight loss, total soluble solids, ascorbic acid, and titratable acidity, were superior to single treatment. The combination of C. laurentii and CMC can not only control postharvest decay but also maintain fruit qualities. Thus, it can be used in grapefruit for commercial purposes.",

      "abstract": "Existing nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery systems for glioma systemic chemotherapy remain a great challenge due to poor delivery efficiency resulting from the blood brain barrier/blood-(brain tumor) barrier (BBB/BBTB) and insufficient tumor penetration. Here, we demonstrate a distinct design by patching doxorubicin-loaded heparin-based nanoparticles (DNs) onto the surface of natural grapefruit extracellular vesicles (EVs), to fabricate biomimetic EV-DNs, achieving efficient drug delivery and thus significantly enhancing antiglioma efficacy. The patching strategy allows the unprecedented 4-fold drug loading capacity compared to traditional encapsulation for EVs. The biomimetic EV-DNs are enabled to bypass BBB/BBTB and penetrate into glioma tissues by receptor-mediated transcytosis and membrane fusion, greatly promoting cellular internalization and antiproliferation ability as well as extending circulation time. We demonstrate that a high-abundance accumulation of EV-DNs can be detected at glioma tissues, enabling the maximal brain tumor uptake of EV-DNs and great antiglioma efficacy in vivo.",

      "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 virus has created an unprecedented impact on healthcare globally. Being a novel virus, several treatments have been explored against COVID-19. During the early stages of the disease, treatment is mainly supportive. While several studies have suggested different treatment modalities, there is still no definitive treatment against COVID-19. Re-purposing already established medications, with excellent safety profiles, is a possible approach for treating the disease in its early stage. Having a mode of transmission as a droplet mode, several studies have supported how the nose can contain the primary route of entry of SARS-CoV-2. Hence, we postulated that re-purposing a commercially available nasal spray containing xylitol and grapefruit seed extract (GSE), namely Xlear Nasal Spray® (Xlear, Inc., American Fork, USA) could be used as an adjunct treatment of COVID-19. With a well-established safety profile, the components of this nasal spray have been studied and have been shown to have potential efficacy against viral pathogens, including coronavirus, and may potentially regulate pathways important in the initial entry of infection, replication, and systemic response to SARS-CoV-2. We present a series of three mild-moderate risks, symptomatic, COVID-19 patients, treated with the intranasal combination, as an adjuvant to their ongoing treatment, with rapid clinical improvement and shorten time to negativization on repeat intranasal swab test via PCR. No safety issues were noted during the course of treatment. Xlear nasal spray, containing xylitol plus GSE, given its established safety profile and compelling clinical results described here, could be a potential adjunct treatment option in mild-moderate COVID-19 cases."

At a β-cyclocitral concentration of 0.5 mM and after ten days cultivation, analysis of the carotenoids showed a significant increase in the content of β-, α-carotene, and phytoene predominantly. The maximal increase in total provitamin A carotenoids content following β-cyclocitral application was ~2-fold higher than the control, reaching 245.8 μg/g DW. The trend for increased transcript levels of biosynthetic genes PSY and ZDS correlated with the enhancement of the content of these carotenes following β-cyclocitral treatment and GC-MS based metabolite profiling showed significant changes of metabolite levels across intermediary metabolism. These findings suggest that β-cyclocitral can act as a chemical elicitor, to enhance the formation of carotenes in citrus suspension-cultured cells (SCC), which could be utilized in studying the regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis and biotechnological application to the renewable production of nutritional carotenoids.",

      "abstract": "Commercial formulations of 29 commonly used herbal supplements (HSs) and grapefruit juice were evaluated for drug interaction potential via quantification of their CYP3A inhibitory potential in two in vitro experimental models of human small intestine, cryopreserved human intestinal mucosa (CHIM), and cryopreserved human enterocytes (CHEs). Two CYP3A substrates were used-in the studies with CHIM, CYP3A activity was quantified via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry quantification of midazolam 1'-hydroxylation, whereas in CHE, luciferin-IPA metabolism to luciferin was quantified by luminescence. Upon treatment of CHIM with the estimated lumen concentration of the HS upon each oral administration (manufacturers' recommended dosage dissolved in 200 ml of culture medium), >80% CYP3A inhibition was observed for green tea extract, St. John's wort, valerian root, horehound, and grapefruit juice. Less than 50% inhibition was observed for fenugreek, aloe vera, guarana, soy isoflavone, maca, echinacea, spirulina, evening primrose, milk thistle, cranberry, red yeast rice, rhodiola, ginkgo biloba, turmeric, curcumin, white kidney bean, garlic, cinnamon, saw palmetto berries, panax ginseng, black elderberry, wheat grass juice, flaxseed oil, black cohosh, and ginger root. The results were confirmed in a a dose-response study with HSs obtained from three suppliers for the four inhibitory HSs (green tea extract, horehound, St. John's wort, valerian root) and three representative noninhibitory HSs (black cohosh, black elderberry, echinacea). Similar results were obtained with the inhibitory HSs in CHE. The results illustrate that CHIM and CHE represent physiologically relevant in vitro experimental models for the evaluation of drug interaction potential of herbal supplements. Based on the results, green tea extract, horehound, St. John's wort, and valerian root may cause drug interactions with orally administered drugs that are CYP3A substrates, as was observed for grapefruit juice. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In vitro evaluation of 29 popular herbal supplements in cryopreserved human intestinal mucosa identified green tea extract, horehound, St. John's wort, and valerian root to have CYP3A inhibitory potential similar to that for grapefruit juice, suggesting their potential to have clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction with orally administered drugs that are CYP3A substrates. The results suggest that cryopreserved human intestinal mucosa can be used for in vitro evaluation of drug interactions involving enteric drug metabolism.",

      "abstract": "The proposed induction heating method was applied in the pasteurization of grapefruit juice. In this processing, an alternating magnetic field acted as the stimulus instead of conventional electrodes to create an induced electric field (IEF) for heat treatment of the continuous-flow juice sample, which excluded the possibility of electrochemical reaction and electrode corrosion that might occur in conventional electric field treatments. As a typical food pathogen, Escherichia coli O157:H7 was selected as a representative to investigate its inactivation by the heating process under different voltages and frequencies, initial temperatures, and flow rates (or retention time). The grapefruit juice was successfully heated up by IEF and the temperature curve was achieved when the juice exposed to IEF. The heating rate and terminal temperature increased with the increasing induced voltage, decreasing frequency and at higher initial temperature. A highest terminal temperature of 93.7 °C for grapefruit juice with an initial temperature of 20 °C was achieved under induced voltage of 2700 V, frequency of 300 Hz and residence time of 400 s. At the same time, E. coli O157:H7 in the grapefruit juice was thoroughly inactivated. There was a trend that the pathogen survival rate was reduced at higher induced voltage, lower frequency and higher initial temperature during the heating treatment. No significant changes in pH and °Brix was observed after this innovative induction heating, but the color of grapefruit juice was brightened. The proposed induction heating can be regarded as a sister technology of ohmic heating, and it provide a reference for the application of this heating method in liquid food pasteurization."

The present study aimed to investigate the structural, functional and in vitro digestion properties of three kinds of bread incorporated with SDFs, named MST-SDF bread (SB), MET-SDF bread (EB), and MUT-SDF bread (UB). Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry and texture profile analysis were used to determine the structural properties. In comparison with the SB and EB, the UB showed an ideal hardness and internal structure, and also significant improvement of the thermal stability. Meanwhile, the UB exhibited the highest overall acceptability in the sensory evaluation. In addition, the water holding capacity (WHC), cholesterol adsorption capacity (CAC) and nitrite ion adsorption capacity (NIAC) of UB were superior to those of the other two samples. Moreover, the in vitro digestive glucose release rates of breads were all significantly reduced by the addition of SDFs, especially that of UB. In summary, the present study showed that UB presented the best performance in terms of structural, functional and in vitro digestion properties, implying that MUT-SDF could be utilized in bread with high quality and low glucose release rate, and developed as a potential ingredient of functional food.",

Furthermore, histopathology analysis revealed that GFJ markedly improve the renal and intestinal morphology. The mRNA expression of urate transporter 1, glucose transporter 9 were downregulated, whereas ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCG2) was upregulated in the GFJ-treated group. The results of immunohistochemistry revealed that the ABCG2 protein expression in the small and large intestine was significantly upregulated after the GFJ administration. These results suggested that GFJ can be used as a urate lowering agent and future mechanistic studies should be conducted.

Group I (control group) received 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (27 ml/ kg/day), group II (MTZ group) received MTZ (400 mg/kg/day), group III (MTZ + GP) received MTZ (400 mg/kg/ day) plus GP juice (27 ml/kg/ day) and group IV (GP group) received GP juice (27 ml/kg) for 60 days. Semen analyses were performed. Free testosterone, gonadotrophin (follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone) and thiamine levels were measured. Samples of cerebellar, testicular and epididymal tissues were used for both colorimetric assays of oxidative stress markers and histopathological examinations. Significant decreases in the sperm count, percent total sperm motility, serum thiamine levels, free testosterone levels and FSH levels were observed in the MTZ and MTZ + GP groups (p < 0.05 for all parameters). Significantly higher oxidative stress levels (p < 0.05) were observed in the cerebellar and testicular tissue homogenates of these groups than in those of the control group, and associated disruptions in the cerebellar, testicular and epididymal structures were apparent compared to those of the control group. Although the GP group showed a significantly higher sperm count and significantly lower oxidative stress than the control group (p < 0.05), with histological similarity to the control group, the GP group exhibited significantly higher prolactin levels and lower free testosterone and FSH levels than the control group (p < 0.05). Oxidative stress and decreased thiamine levels could explain the MTZ-induced neurotoxicity and infertility side effects that aggravated by GP co-administration.",

This study is aimed to obtain new food ingredients based on freeze-dried grapefruit formulated with high molecular weight solutes (gum arabic and bamboo fiber) in three different proportions (F1, F2, and F3). To improve the FD, a mild microwave drying pre-treatment was applied. Influence of the water content and the presence of high molecular weight solutes on freeze-drying kinetics was tested by Midilli-Kucuk and Page models. The best FD kinetic model fit on grapefruit powders were Midilli-Kucuk for F2 and F3, and Page for F1, and the adequate freeze-drying times for F1, F2, and F3 were 24, 16, and 18 h, respectively. Final samples were evaluated for nutritional and antioxidant capacity. Gum arabic and bamboo fiber present a protector effect, which results in a significant antioxidant capacity due to the protection of flavonoids and antioxidant vitamins. These novel food ingredients could be of great interest for the food industry in order to develop foods with improved antioxidant capacity as well as enriched in natural fibers and/or micronutrients."

The electrical conductivity was measured at voltage gradients (10, 20, and 30 V/cm) and vacuum pressure (0 [atmospheric pressure], -30, and -60 kPa) for four temperature ranges (30, 40, 50, and 60 °C), meanwhile the heating rate was also reported at the same level of pressure and voltage gradient. The electrical conductivity and heating rate considerably vary by voltage gradient relative to pressure. Grapefruit had considerably lower electrical conductivity (about 20%) relative to lemon juice for the same pressure-voltage gradient treatment, while the percent reduction of heating rate (grapefruit relative to lemon) varied from 19 to 32%. The multivariate linear regression of electrical conductivity, including temperature and voltage, was found to be a more suitable model. pH assessments showed that pressure significantly affected the pH of grapefruit and lemon juices (P < 0.01). The combination of different treatments, which created a shorter residence time, caused a greater decrease in pH.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Methadone is a synthetic mu-opioid receptor agonist used in the treatment of chronic pain and opioid dependence. Methadone is metabolized by several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes; primarily CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and CYP2D6 before renal and fecal elimination. Exposure to substances like grapefruit juice, that inhibit these isoenzymes may result in increased blood levels of methadone, and thus may manifest clinically as unexpected opioid toxicity. CASE: A 51-year-old male was found unresponsive. He was hypoxic and bradypneic with pinpoint pupils. Multiple boluses followed by infusion of naloxone were required before improvement of respiratory status. Upon awakening, the patient reported participating in an opioid treatment program where he is administered 90 mg of oral methadone daily and denied any other substance use. On further questioning, he admitted to drinking grapefruit juice (estimated to be approximately 500 mL/day) every day for 3 consecutive days before presentation. The patient was discharged home after being counseled to stop drinking grapefruit juice. DISCUSSION: Grapefruit juice is known to be an inhibitor of the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. Various studies demonstrate that through CYP3A4 inhibition, grapefruit juice increases serum levels of opioids, such as methadone, though no clinically significant effects have been reported. CONCLUSIONS: Grapefruit juice inhibits the metabolism of methadone, raising its serum levels. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in which the interaction between grapefruit juice and methadone was significant enough to cause an opioid toxidrome. It is, therefore, recommended that opioid treatment programs (OTPs) advise patients about this interaction before administering methadone.",

Results showed that the HVED energy input can be reduced, when the subsequent solid-liquid extraction was performed in 20% (w/v) aqueous glycerol or in DES (lactic acid: glucose) instead of water. The addition of glycerol has reduced the energy of the pre-treatment by 6 times. The same diffusivity of polyphenols (4 × 10-11 m2/s) was obtained in water from HVED pre-treated peels at 218 kJ/kg and in aqueous glycerol from pre-treated peels at 36 kJ/kg.

We found that treating rats with GFJ before and/or after prednisolone-induced osteoporosis resulted in increased bone density, total mineral content, and calcium content to counteract the osteoporotic effects of prednisolone. In parallel, the histological and ultrastructural results of the GFJ-treated groups correlated well with enhanced breaking strength of femurs subjected to a constant load. Furthermore, GFJ treatment before and after prednisolone-induced osteoporosis decreased plasma alkaline phosphatase and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activities and increased the level of insulin-like growth factor 1. Mechanistically, our immunohistochemistry study showed that GFJ ameliorated prednisolone-induced osteocalcin depletion, decreased receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) expression, and increased osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression. GFJ showed a beneficial anti-osteoporotic effect against prednisolone-induced osteoporosis in rats, possibly via the RANKL/OPG axis, suggesting that GFJ might be a good candidate for developing anti-osteoporotic drugs."

GSE solution diluted with distilled water to 0.1% (0.1% GSE) and 1% (1% GSE) and solutions with Polident® denture cleansing tablet dissolved in distilled water (Polident) or in 0.1% GSE solution (0.1% G+P) were prepared as cleansing solutions. Discs of acrylic resin were prepared, and the biofilm of C. albicans was formed on the discs. The discs with the biofilm were treated with each solution for 5 min at 25°C. After the treatment, the biofilm on the discs was analyzed using a colony forming unit (CFU) assay, fluorescence microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In order to assess the persistent cleansing effect, the discs treated with each solution for 5 min were aerobically incubated in Yeast Nitrogen Base medium for another 24 h. After incubation, the persistent effect was assessed by CFU assay. Some specimens of acrylic resin were immersed in each solution for 7 days, and changes in surface roughness (Ra), Vickers hardness (VH), flexural strength (FS), and flexural modulus (FM) were evaluated. As a result, the treatment with 1% GSE for 5 min almost completely eliminated the biofilm formed on the resin; whereas, the treatment with 0.1% GSE, Polident, and 0.1% G+P for 5 min showed a statistically significant inhibitory effect on biofilms. In addition, 0.1% GSE and 0.1% G+P exerted a persistent inhibitory effect on biofilms. Fluorescence microscopy indicated that Polident mainly induced the death of yeast, while the cleansing solutions containing at least 0.1% GSE induced the death of hyphae as well as yeast. SEM also revealed that Polident caused wrinkles, shrinkage, and some deep craters predominantly on the cell surfaces of yeast, while the solutions containing at least 0.1% GSE induced wrinkles, shrinkage, and some damage on cell surfaces of not only yeasts but also hyphae. No significant changes in Ra, VH, FS, or FM were observed after immersion in any of the solutions. Taken together, GSE solution is capable of cleansing C. albicans biofilms on denture-base resin and has a persistent inhibitory effect on biofilm development, without any deteriorations of resin surface.",

HER2 promotes the growth of cancer cells and makes them particularly aggressive. Currently, trastuzumab is the only HER2-targeted therapeutic agent approved by the FDA for HER2-overexpressing breast cancer treatment. However, clinical efficacy of trastuzumab is limited greatly by the occurrence of drug resistance. In this study, an aptamer (HA1) specific for HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells was selected using Cell-SELEX. This allowed the development of grapefruit-derived nanovectors (GNVs) conjugated with HA1 that targeted specifically HER2+ breast cancer cells. In vitro experiments demonstrated that HA1 effectively promoted the internalisation of GNVs into cancer cells and tumour spheroids. In vivo data showed that drug delivery to tumour tissues and antitumor activities were dramatically enhanced by conjugating HA1 with drug-loaded GNVs. This study indicates that aptamers mediating targeted drug delivery by GNVs represent a promising strategy for HER2+ breast cancer therapy.",

The graft copolymer application kept fruit firmness without impairing the fruit quality. Moreover, the graft copolymer treatment inhibited the activity and gene expression of cell wall-modifying enzymes such as polygalacturonase, cellulase, pectin methylesterase, α-l-arabinofuranosidase, β-galactosidase, and suppressed the modification of cell wall components including covalently bound polysaccharide (sodium carbonate soluble pectin, 24% KOH-soluble fraction), which were associated with fruit softening.

Whole grapefruit were inoculated with either E. coli or Salmonella and dried, and exposed to a variety of treatments on a lab-scale brush wash system. Individual processes were evaluated on the pilot packinglines with E. coli only. In all lab-scale brush wash system treatments, bacterial population reductions between E. coli and Salmonella were not significantly different (P ≤ 0.05). On pilot packinglines, E. coli populations were reduced by 3.59 to >5.11 log CFU/grapefruit at the CREC packingline, and by 3.30 to >5.13 log CFU/grapefruit at the IRREC packingline. Treatment of fruit through complete packingline processing at both locations reduced E. coli populations to levels below the detection limit (<1 log CFU/grapefruit).

      "abstract": "Tumor-specific delivery of therapeutics is challenging. One of the major hurdles for successfully delivering targeted agents by nanovectors is the filtering role of the liver in rapidly sequestering nanovectors from the circulation. Exosomes, a type of endogenous nanoparticle, circulate continuously in the peripheral blood and play a role in intercellular communication. The aim of this study was to determine whether the level of endogenous exosomes has an effect on nanovector delivery efficiency of targeted agents. Methods: Exosomes were isolated from peripheral blood and intravenously (I.V.) injected into tumor-bearing mice. Subsequently, 1,1-dioctadecyl-3,3,3'3'-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine-iodide (DiR) fluorescent dye-labeled nanoparticles, including grapefruit nanovectors (GNV) and standard liposomes, were I.V. injected in the mice. The efficiency of redirecting GNVs from liver to other organs of injected mice was further analyzed with in vivo imaging. The concentration of chemo drugs delivered by GNV was measured by HPLC and the anti-lung metastasis therapeutic effects of chemo drugs delivered by GNVs in mouse breast cancer and melanoma cancer models were evaluated. Results: We show that tail vein-injected exosomes isolated from mouse peripheral blood were predominately taken up by liver Kupffer cells. Injection of peripheral blood-derived exosomes before I.V. injection of grapefruit-derived nanovector (GNV) decreased the deposition of GNV in the liver and redirected the GNV to the lung and to the tumor in breast and melanoma tumor-bearing mouse models. Enhanced therapeutic efficiency of doxorubicin (Dox) or paclitaxel (PTX) carried by GNVs for lung metastases was demonstrated when there was an I.V. injection of exosomes before therapeutic treatment. Furthermore, we found that CD36 and IGFR1 receptor-mediated pathways played a critical role in the exosome-mediated inhibitory effect of GNV entry into liver macrophages. Conclusions: Collectively, our findings provide a foundation for using autologous exosomes to enhance therapeutic vector targeted delivery to the lung.",

      "abstract": "Rind biochemical properties play major roles in defence mechanisms against the incidence of rind physiological disorders of citrus fruit during cold storage. Hence, multivariate calibration models were developed to rapidly and non-destructively determine rind biochemical properties of citrus fruit from visible to near-infrared (Vis/NIR) spectra acquired by Vis/NIR spectroscopy using partial least square regression algorithm. To achieve optimum models for determination of each rind biochemical property, several mathematical pre-processing methods were explored, including no pre-treatment. However, special emphases were given to the best model statistics in terms of coefficient of determination (R2) and residual predictive deviation (RPD). Models were performed by critical examination of different wavelength ranges (visible, near-infrared and full regions) and combinations of fruit harvested from different production regions and acquired before (week 0) and after (week 9) cold storage. Results obtained showed excellent models for determining parameters such as sucrose (R2 = 0.99 and RPD = 11.42), total flavonoids (R2 = 0.99 and RPD = 12.37), and chlorophyll b (R2 = 0.97 and RPD = 5.67). This study reported the first application of Vis/NIR and chemometrics in determining the rind biochemical properties of 'Marsh' grapefruit rapidly and non-destructively.",

METHODS: In this study, we developed a targeted drug and small interfering (si)RNA co-delivery system based on specific aptamer-conjugated grapefruit-derived nanovectors (GNVs) that we tested in MDR LoVo colon cancer cells. The internalization of nanovectors in cancer cells was tested by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The anti-cancer activity in vitro was determined by colony formation and cell apoptosis assays. The biodistribution of nanovectors was analyzed by live imaging and the anti-cancer activity in vivo was observed. RESULTS: GNVs loaded with aptamer increased doxorubicin (Dox) accumulation in MDR LoVo cells, an effect that was abolished by pretreatment with DNase. The LA1 aptamer effectively promoted nanovector internalization into cells at 4°C and increased the targeted delivery of Dox to tumors. Constructs harboring Dox, LA1, and P-gp siRNA more effectively inhibited proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in cultured MDR LoVo cells while exhibiting more potent anti-tumor activity in vivo than free Dox or GNVs loaded with Dox alone or in conjunction with LA1, an effect that was associated with downregulation of P-gp expression. CONCLUSION: This GNV-based system may be an effective strategy for overcoming MDR in clinical settings.",

At the higher combination of UV-C light and trans-CAH, the microbial load of grapefruit juice was maintained below 100 CFU/mL up to 15 days. For mesophiles, the three predictive models indicated that the parameters n and Nmax decreased and the parameters λ and tc increased as the combination of UV-C light and trans-CAH increased. The response surface modeling of the parameters obtained by the predictive models showed acceptable correlation for mesophiles (R2 = 0.815-0.977) but not for yeasts (R2 = 0.618-0.815).

      "abstract": "This review addressed drug interactions precipitated by fruit juices other than grapefruit juice based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Literature was identified by searching PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science till December 30 2017. Among 46 finally included RCTs, six RCTs simply addressed pharmacodynamic interactions and 33 RCTs studied pharmacokinetic interactions, whereas seven RCTs investigated both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. Twenty-two juice-drug combinations showed potential clinical relevance. The beneficial combinations included orange juice-ferrous fumarate, lemon juice-99mTc-tetrofosmin, pomegranate juice-intravenous iron during hemodialysis, cranberry juice-triple therapy medications for H. pylori, blueberry juice-etanercept, lime juice-antimalarials, and wheat grass juice-chemotherapy. The potential adverse interactions included decreased drug bioavailability (apple juice-fexofenadine, atenolol, aliskiren; orange juice-aliskiren, atenolol, celiprolol, montelukast, fluoroquinolones, alendronate; pomelo juice-sildenafil; grape juice-cyclosporine), increased bioavailability (Seville orange juice-felodipine, pomelo juice-cyclosporine, orange-aluminum containing antacids). Unlike furanocoumarin-rich grapefruit juice which could primarily precipitate drug interactions by strong inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme and P-glycoprotein and thus cause deadly outcomes due to co-ingestion with some medications, other fruit juices did not precipitate severely detrimental food-drug interaction despite of sporadic case reports. The extent of a juice-drug interaction may be associated with volume of drinking juice, fruit varieties, type of fruit, time between juice drinking and drug intake, genetic polymorphism in the enzymes or transporters and anthropometric variables. Pharmacists and health professionals should properly screen for and educate patients about potential adverse juice-drug interactions and help minimize their occurrence. Much attention should be paid to adolescents and the elderly who ingest medications with drinking fruit juices or consume fresh fruits during drug treatment. Meanwhile, more researches in this interesting issue should be conducted.",

RESULTS: Treatment with NaHCO3 , under alkaline pH, delayed the polygalacturonase activity for 72 h, or 48 h in the case of the pectin lyase, compared with the control or the same treatment at pH 5. In contrast, pectin methyl esterase activity rapidly increased after 24 h, in plugs dipped in the same solution. In this case, the activity remained higher than untreated or pH 5-treated plugs up to 72 h. CONCLUSION: The rapid increase in pectin methyl esterase activity under alkaline conditions is presumably the strategy of the pathogen to lower the pH, soon after the initiation of infection, in order to restore an optimal environment for the subsequent polygalacturonase and pectin lyase action. In fact, at the same time, a low pH delayed the enzymatic activity of polygalacturonase and pectin lyase, the two enzymes that actually cleave the α-1,4-linkages between the galacturonic acid residues. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.",

The results revealed that treatment with bergamottin for 48 h significantly inhibited wound-healing migration and Matrigel invasion of human glioma cells, compared with untreated cells (P<0.05). Bergamottin treatment caused a significant decrease in the expression and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 in glioma cells compared with untreated cells (P<0.05). A Rac1-GTP pull-down assay demonstrated that bergamottin-treated glioma cells had a significantly decreased level of active Rac1-GTP compared with untreated cells (P<0.05). However, bergamottin had no significant effect on cell division cycle 42 activity. Expression of constitutively activated Rac1 almost completely restored the migration and invasion of bergamottin-treated glioma cells. In addition, bergamottin-induced downregulation of MMP-9 was prevented by exogenous activated Rac1. The results of the present study demonstrated that bergamottin exhibits anti-invasive activity in human glioma cells through the inactivation of Rac1 and downregulation of MMP-9."

After heating, the grapefruits were hydro-cooled and stored at 23 °C and analyzed for 16 days. The effect of microwave-assisted HWT (MW-HWT) on grapefruit quality was analyzed and compared with the quality of fruits treated with HWT and control fruits (without treatment). The physicochemical properties and chemical composition of essential oil were analyzed. RESULTS: MW-HWT was equivalent to HWT according to accumulated heat calculations, with the advantage of being shorter. Treatments significantly affected the weight, color, maturity index, juice content, firmness, titratable acidity, pH, and ascorbic acid content of the grapefruits (P < 0.05), but had no effect on the total soluble solids (P > 0.05). The major components identified in the essential oil were d-limonene and β-myrcene, compounds responsible of the scent of the grapefruits. CONCLUSION: MW-HWT was shorter (130 min) and had a lesser effect on the quality of the grapefruit when compared with fruits under HWT (188 min duration). Thus, this treatment could be considered as an alternative method against the Mexican fruit fly in grapefruit. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.",

However, the consumption of fresh grapefruit is low. Freeze-dried powdered grapefruit can be an alternative to promote this fruit consumption. To improve the quality and stability of the powdered fruit, encapsulating and anticaking agents can be added. In the present study, different grapefruit powders obtained by freeze-drying with the addition of gum arabic (1.27 g per 100 g) and bamboo fibre (0.76 g per 100 g) with and without a pre-drying microwave treatment were compared with the fresh and freeze-dried fruit with no carriers added, aiming to evaluate the effect of these preservation processes on phenolics content and on its antioxidant [1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP)] and anti-inflamatory (evaluated in RAW 264.7 macrophages) capacities. RESULTS: Freeze-drying and gum arabic and bamboo fibre addition significantly increased total phenolics, as well as the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities (by inhibiting nitric oxide production of lipopolysaccharide activated RAW 264.7 macrophages), of grapefruit. An additional increase in these parameters was obtained with microwave pretreatment before freeze-drying. CONCLUSIONS: The combined addition of gum arabic and bamboo fibre to grapefruit puree and the application of a microwave pretreatment improve the functional properties of the fruit without showing cytotoxicity in vitro. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Grapefruit juice (GFJ) and acidity are thought to inhibit this enzyme in vitro. This study examines the effect of GFJ and intense exercise on 11β-HSD2 enzyme activity in vivo. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighteen subjects ingested GFJ or apple juice (CON) on separate days prior to reporting to the laboratory in a randomized order. Saliva (Sal) samples were obtained at baseline, 15 and 45 minutes post-treadmill stress test; Sal cortisone (E) and cortisol (F) levels were determined, and the Sal cortisone:cortisol (E:F) ratio was used as an index of 11β-HSD2 enzyme activity at rest and after intense muscular work. RESULTS: GFJ treatment decreased baseline 11β-HSD2 enzyme activity (44%) and Sal-E (28%) compared to CON (both, p < 0.05). Sal-E (r = 0.61, p < 0.05) and Sal-F (r = 0.66, p < 0.05) were correlated with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in GFJ-treated individuals. Treadmill stress significantly increased Sal-E and Sal-F but did not alter 11β-HSD2 enzyme activity regardless of treatment. When treatments were examined separately, CON 11β-HSD2 enzyme activity decreased by 36% (p < 0.05) from baseline to 15 post-treadmill exercise. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that GFJ and intense muscular work decrease 11β-HSD-2 activity independently, and no additive effect was noted. The association between DBP and the levels of Sal-F and Sal-E during the GFJ trial should be interpreted cautiously and warrants further investigation.",

The pH and cooking loss of cured chicken breast decreased with increasing GSE levels, and the water holding capacity increased with increasing GSE levels. The hardness and chewiness of GSE-treated chicken breast were higher than those of N and C. Hunter's L and a color values increased significantly after GSE addition. Moreover, 0.1% GSE (G0.1) increased the flavor and total acceptability scores. The 2-thiobarbituric acid and volatile basic nitrogen values of the 0.5% GSE group decreased significantly compared with those of C group. Total microbial counts of GSE-treated chicken breast were higher than those of C, but that lower than those of N. Adding GSE to chicken breast delayed lipid peroxidation and had antimicrobial effects during cold storage. GSE improved shelf life and palatability; therefore, it could be used as a natural antioxidant and functional curing agent ingredient in meat products."

Low-temperature conditioning significantly reduced CI but did not affect the total soluble solids, acidity, and ripening ratio. After 12 weeks of storage, grapefruits showed no significant differences in lycopene, narirutin, poncirin, furocoumarins, and radical scavenging activity in all the three treatments. Limonin was significantly higher (p < .05) in CD fruits, nomilin was significantly higher in fruits stored at 11°C, whereas fruits stored at 5°C had lower levels of naringin, neohesperidin, and didymin after 12 weeks of storage.

This may arise due to the fact that oral medication patient can take at home and it reduce the stress associated with taking the drug. On the Polish pharmaceutical market can be observed more frequent registration to trading anticancer drugs in oral form. Is also growing interest about drug interactions with food, but they are still less accented than drug-drug interactions. The results of pharmacokinetic studies on the interaction of drugs used in antineoplastic therapy with food are particularly important because of the characteristics of cancer patients, and a growing number of people suffering from cancer and which may have a problem. The aim of the study was to collect and present clinically relevant interactions of anticancer drugs in oral form used in oncology with grapefruit juice based on the latest scientific reports and the summary of product characteristics.",

The antimicrobial effects of 1% MA and 0.5% GSE alone and in combination (1% MA+0.5% GSE) were tested on artificially inoculated lettuce during storage at 5°C for 14 days. The maximum reductions of E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhimurium, and L. monocytogenes were 4.96, 4.80, and 3.95 log CFU/g observed with MA+GSE during storage for 14 days, respectively. MA+GSE showed the greatest reduction against in E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes. These results indicate that the combined treatment was more effective than MA and GSE alone treatment. Therefore, it suggests that MA + GSE could be used as an effective intervention method for improving microbiological safety of fresh-cut lettuce."

In vitro assay demonstrated Zinkicide SG4 had a twofold lower minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Escherichia coli and X. alfalfae subsp. citrumelonis (62.5 to 250 µg/ml) compared with copper sulfate (250 µg/ml), copper hydroxide (250 to 500 µg/ml), or cuprous oxide/zinc oxide (125 to 250 µg/ml). Zinkicide SG6 had a sevenfold to eightfold lower MIC against Escherichia coli and X. alfalfae subsp. citrumelonis (31 to 250 μg/ml). Leaves of sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) and fruit of 'Ruby Red' grapefruit (C. paradisi) were evaluated for citrus canker disease control. A greenhouse assay with foliage demonstrated that spray treatment with Zinkicide reduced citrus canker lesion development after injection-infiltration of X. citri subsp. citri into the leaf intercellular space. In field trials conducted in Southeast Florida in 2014 and 2015, Zinkicide SG4 and SG6 reduction of grapefruit canker incidence exceeded that of cuprous oxide and cuprous oxide/zinc oxide bactericides. Zinkicide formulations were also effective against the fungal diseases, citrus scab (Elsinoe fawcetti) and melanose (Diaporthe citri), on grapefruit. No sign of phytotoxicity to the fruit rind was observed during either season. Antimicrobial activity of Zinkicide for protection of leaves and fruit against X. citri subsp. citri was comparable or exceeded that for commercial copper and zinc oxide formulations which may be attributed to translaminar movement of Zinkicide."

Pharmacokinetic profiles were also determined. Extracts were administered per os to Eimeria naturally infected growing lambs during 90 consecutive days. The commercial anticoccidial drug toltrazuril (TTZ) was included in this trial as a standard. Twenty-four lambs were divided into four groups: NAR, lambs given a daily dose of 5mg of a commercial naringenin extract of 98% higher purity per kg body weight; GF, lambs that recived a daily dose of 5mg of ethanolic extract of grapefruit peels per kg body weight; TTZ, lambs treated with 20mg of toltrazuril/kg body weight on days 0 and 15 of the experiment; and CTRL, untreated lambs that received daily dose of 30ml of water. Daily doses of GF and NAR were dissolved in 30ml of water and orally given to animals; whereas toltrazuril was administered as a single dose of an undiluted suspension to lambs of the TTZ group. The CTRL group received 30ml of water; as well as the TTZ group for the period after the single dose administration. Fecal and serum samples were collected from all lambs. Anticoccidial efficacy was estimated by coprological techniques. Generation of nitric oxide levels and the antioxidant capacity of the experimental compounds were determined by the Griess and ABTS assays, respectively. The pharmacokinetic parameters of NAR and the GF extract were obtained. On day 30 post-ingestion, anticoccidial efficacy was 91.76% (NAR) and 89.65% (GF); whereas 99.63% of efficacy was achieved with TTZ 15days after treatment. NAR, GF and TTZ significantly reduced oxidative stress in infected animals. The mean daily weight gain for each group was 122g (NAR), 122g (GF), 143g (TTZ) and 98g (CTRL). Following the oral administration of NAR and GF, values in plasma approached maximum concentrations within 2.1 to 2.5h. In conclusion, the administration of NAR and the GF extract reduced Eimeria oocyst output, oxidative stress and promoted higher mean daily weight gains in infected lambs.",

      "abstract": "An interaction of drug with food, herbs, and dietary supplements is usually the consequence of a physical, chemical or physiologic relationship between a drug and a product consumed as food, nutritional supplement or over-the-counter medicinal plant. The current educational review aims at reminding to the prescribing physicians that the most clinically relevant drug-food interactions may not be strictly limited to those with grapefruit juice and with the Saint John's Wort herbal extract and may be responsible for changes in drug plasma concentrations, which in turn decrease efficacy or led to sometimes life-threatening toxicity. Common situations handled in clinical practice such as aging, concomitant medications, transplant recipients, patients with cancer, malnutrition, HIV infection and those receiving enteral or parenteral feeding may be at increased risk of drug-food or drug-herb interactions. Medications with narrow therapeutic index or potential life-threatening toxicity, e.g., the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioid analgesics, cardiovascular medications, warfarin, anticancer drugs and immunosuppressants may be at risk of significant drug-food interactions to occur. Despite the fact that considerable effort has been achieved to increase patient' and doctor's information and ability to anticipate their occurrence and consequences in clinical practice, a thorough and detailed health history and dietary recall are essential for identifying potential problems in order to optimize patient prescriptions and drug dosing on an individual basis as well as to increase the treatment risk/benefit ratio.",

We investigated the efficacy and safety of GFJ intake with TAC in cases of connective tissue diseases in which the TAC blood concentration was insufficiently high for clinical improvement, even when 3 mg/day or more of TAC was administered. Methods Seven patients took 200 mL of GFJ every day. The trough levels of the TAC blood concentration were measured before and after GFJ intake and the clinical courses were monitored thereafter. Results First, we surveyed the blood TAC trough levels of 30 recent patients who took 3 mg/day of TAC, and found that 21 patients (70%) did not achieve the minimum target TAC concentration (>5 ng/mL). Seven patients took GFJ due to a lack of efficacy and a relatively low TAC blood concentration. GFJ increased the TAC level from 4.3±2.4 ng/mL to 13.8±6.9 ng/mL (average increase: 3.3-fold). GFJ was also effective in achieving a clinical improvement in most cases without causing any severe adverse events, and it helped to decrease the dosages of glucocorticoid and TAC. In some cases, the blood TAC concentration fluctuated for no apparent reason. Conclusion GFJ intake was effective for the elevation of TAC concentration by approximately three fold and clinical improvement, but special care is required for monitoring its influence on concomitantly used drugs as well as TAC concentration. The addition of GFJ to TAC treatment could be an efficacious treatment option, when the plasma TAC concentration does not reach the minimal target concentration.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of multiple daily consumption of grapefruit juice (GFJ) and pomegranate juice (PJ) on the pharmacokinetics of dapoxetine, we conducted an open-label, three-way crossover study in 12 healthy subjects using midazolam as a probe substrate for CYP3A4. METHODS: Participants received a single oral dose of dapoxetine (60 mg) and midazolam (7.5 mg) after pretreatment with 250 ml of either water, undiluted GFJ, or PJ for three consecutive days. All subjects were monitored for adverse effects during the study period. RESULTS: Compared to pretreatment with water, GFJ increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-∞) and peak plasma concentration (C max) of dapoxetine by 60 and 80 %, respectively, and prolonged its elimination half-life (t 1/2) by 43 %. Similar effects of GFJ on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam were observed with a significant increase in AUC0-∞ (75 %), C max (40 %), and t 1/2 (92 %). Slight but not statistically significant changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of dapoxetine and midazolam after pretreatment with PJ. Time to reach C max (T max) did not differ among the three phases. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that GFJ increases the extent of absorption and reduces clearance of dapoxetine possibly by inhibition of both intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4, whereas PJ has little effect on dapoxetine pharmacokinetics. Although the impact of GFJ on the pharmacokinetics of dapoxetine was mild, a great caution should be considered when they are concomitantly administered.",

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of naringin on glucose intolerance, oxidative stress and ketonemia in type 1 diabetic rats. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats divided into 5 groups (n = 7) were orally treated daily with 3.0 ml/kg body weight (BW)/day of distilled water (group 1) or 50 mg/kg BW of naringin (groups 2 and 4, respectively). Groups 3, 4 and 5 were given a single intra-peritoneal injection of 60 mg/kg BW of streptozotocin to induce diabetes. Group 3 was further treated with subcutaneous insulin (4.0 IU/kg BW) twice daily, respectively. RESULTS: Stretozotocin (STZ) only-treated groups exhibited hyperglycemia, polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss, glucose intolerance, low fasting plasma insulin and reduced hepatic glycogen content compared to the control group. Furthermore they had significantly elevated Malondialdehyde (MDA), acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, anion gap and significantly reduced blood pH and plasma bicarbonate compared to the control group. Naringin treatment significantly improved Fasting Plasma Insulin (FPI), hepatic glycogen content, malondialdehyde, β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, bicarbonate, blood pH and anion gap but not Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG) compared to the STZ only-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Naringin is not hypoglycemic but ameliorates ketoacidosis and oxidative stress. Naringin supplements could therefore mitigate complications of diabetic ketoacidosis.",

Here, we provide evidence for the role of miR-18a in the induction of liver M1 (F4/80+interferon gamma (IFNγ)+IL-12+) macrophages. We found that miR-18a encapsulated in grapefruit-derived nanovector (GNV) mediated inhibition of liver metastasis that is dependent upon the induction of M1 (F4/80+IFNγ+IL-12+) macrophages; depletion of macrophages eliminated its anti-metastasis effect. Furthermore, the miR-18a mediated induction of macrophage IFNγ by targeting IRF2 is required for subsequent induction of IL-12. IL-12 then activates natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells for inhibition of liver metastasis of colon cancer. This conclusion is supported by the fact that knockout of IFNγ eliminates miR-18a mediated induction of IL-12, miR-18a treatment has an anti-metastatic effects in T cell deficient mice but there is no anti-metastatic effect on NK and NKT deficient mice. Co-delivery of miR-18a and siRNA IL-12 to macrophages did not result in activation of co-cultured NK and NKT cells. Taken together our results indicate that miR-18a can act as an inhibitor for liver metastasis through induction of M1 macrophages.",

We show that GNVs coated with folic acid (FA-GNVs) are enhanced for targeting the GNVs to a folate receptor-positive GL-26 brain tumor. Additionally, FA-GNV-coated polyethylenimine (FA-pGNVs) not only enhance the capacity to carry RNA, but the toxicity of the polyethylenimine is eliminated by the GNVs. Intranasal administration of miR17 carried by FA-pGNVs led to rapid delivery of miR17 to the brain that was selectively taken up by GL-26 tumor cells. Mice treated intranasally with FA-pGNV/miR17 had delayed brain tumor growth.

A randomized, open-label, three-period crossover study was carried out in 12 healthy Chinese male volunteers who were randomized to one of the three treatments: pirfenidone tablets (0.4 g) were orally administered to fasted or fed subjects, or with grapefruit juice. The washout period was 7 d. 3. Significantly reduced maximum plasma concentration (Cmax, 5.0 5 ± 1.39 versus 10.9 0 ± 2.94 mg·L(- 1)), modestly affected area-under-the-plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to 12 h post dosing (AUC0-12 h, 21.8 9 ± 6.47 versus 26.1 6 ± 7.32 mg·h·L(- 1)) and delayed time to reach Cmax (Tmax) were observed in fed group compared with fasted group. Similar effects on Cmax (5.8 2 ± 1.23 versus 10.9 0 ± 2.94 mg·L(- 1)) and AUC0-12 h (modest but not statistically significant, 24.4 4 ± 7.40 versus 26.1 6 ± 7.32 mg·h·L(- 1)) were observed for grapefruit juice compared to fasted subjects. 4. Co-administration of pirfenidone with grapefruit juice resulted in modestly reduced overall oral absorption and significantly reduced peak concentrations compared to fasting, which was similar to effect of food ingestion. No adverse events were observed in the study, but relatively dramatic reduction of peak concentrations should raise concerns for clinical efficacy and safety.",

Ibrutinib undergoes extensive rapid oxidative metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450 3A both at the level of first pass and clearance, which might result in low oral bioavailability. The present study was designed to investigate the absolute bioavailability (F) of ibrutinib in the fasting and fed state and assess the effect of grapefruit juice (GFJ) on the systemic exposure of ibrutinib in order to determine the fraction escaping the gut (Fg ) and the fraction escaping hepatic extraction (Fh ) in the fed state. METHODS: All participants received treatment A [560 mg oral ibrutinib, under fasting conditions], B (560 mg PO ibrutinib, fed, administered after drinking glucose drink) and C (140 mg oral ibrutinib, fed, with intake of GFJ before dosing). A single intravenous (i.v.) dose of 100 μg (13) C6 -ibrutinib was administered 2 h after each oral dose. RESULTS: The estimated 'F' for treatments A, B and C was 3.9%, 8.4% and 15.9%, respectively. Fg and Fh in the fed state were 47.0% and 15.9%, respectively. Adverse events were mild to moderate in severity (Grade 1-2) and resolved without sequelae by the end of the study. CONCLUSION: The absolute oral bioavailability of ibrutinib was low, ranging from 3.9% in the fasting state to 8.4% when administered 30 min before a standard breakfast without GFJ and 15.9% with GFJ. Ibrutinib was well tolerated following a single oral and i.v. dose, under both fasted and fed conditions and regardless of GFJ intake status.",

Furthermore, the grapefruits were stored at 11 °C for 3 weeks and then at 21 °C for 2 weeks. Degreening improved the peel colour of the grapefruit without affecting total soluble solids or acidity of the juice. Degreened fruits had significantly more ascorbic acid after 35 days of storage. Degreening had no significant effect on the levels of carotenoids, limonoids and flavonoids as compared to the non-degreened fruits, after 35 days of storage. However, after 7 days, degreened fruits had more limonin and flavonoids and less furocoumarin, namely 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin. Overall, ethylene treatment had a significant effect on the phytochemical contents of Rio Red grapefruit, especially after 7 days of storage.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The consumption of citrus fruits is associated with health benefits. However, clinical data regarding the effects of grapefruit flavanone consumption on vascular function are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to address the role of flavanones in the long-term effects induced by grapefruit juice (GFJ) consumption on vascular function in healthy postmenopausal women. DESIGN: Forty-eight healthy postmenopausal women aged 50-65 y within 3-10 y since menopause, a body mass index (in kg/m(2)) of 19-30, and a waist size >88 cm completed this double-blind, randomized, controlled, crossover trial. These volunteers were randomly assigned to consume 340 mL GFJ/d, providing 210 mg naringenin glycosides, or a matched control drink without flavanones for 6 mo each, with a 2-mo washout between beverages. The primary endpoint was the assessment of endothelial function in the brachial artery by using flow-mediated dilation. Blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and endothelial function in the peripheral arterial bed were also evaluated as indicators of vascular function. These measurements and blood collection for clinical biochemical markers were performed in overnight-fasted subjects before and after the 6-mo treatment periods. RESULTS: The mean ± SD carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, which reflects central aortic stiffness, was statistically significantly lower after consumption of GFJ (7.36 ± 1.15 m/s) than after consumption of the matched control drink without flavanones (7.70 ± 1.36 m/s), with a P value of 0.019 for the treatment effect. Endothelial function in macro- and microcirculation, blood pressure, anthropometric measures, glucose metabolism, and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress were not affected by the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Regular GFJ consumption by middle-aged, healthy postmenopausal women is beneficial for arterial stiffness. This effect may be related to flavanones present in grapefruit. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01272167.",

They serve as a primary source of vitamins and minerals as well as of natural phytonutrients with antioxidant properties. Jam constitutes an interesting way to preserve fruit. Traditionally, this product is obtained by intense heat treatment that may cause irreversible loss of these bioactive compounds responsible for the health-related properties of fruits. In this work, different grapefruit jams obtained by conventional, osmotic dehydration (OD) without thermal treatment and/or microwave (MW) techniques were compared in terms of their vitamin, organic acid and phytochemical content and their stability through three months of storage. If compared with heating, osmotic treatments lead to a greater loss of organic acids and vitamin C during both processing and storage. MW treatments permit jam to be obtained which has a similar nutritional and functional value than that obtained when using a conventional heating method, but in a much shorter time.",

On arrival, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score was 9 and he showed signs of restlessness. Grapefruit juice-like gastric fluid, with tablet residue, was observed in his stomach after we inserted a gastric tube. Our initial test detected a blood CBZ level of 41.5 mg/L. OUTCOME: We treated the patient with gastric lavage, activated charcoal, and charcoal hemoperfusion. His blood CBZ level began to decrease after gastrointestinal decontamination, and he was discharged without any sequelae on day 9. CONCLUSION: Gastric lavage or aspiration may be considered in cases where drug residue is found in the stomach, especially if materials are involved that might exacerbate the drug's toxicity."

Using three inflammatory-driven disease mouse models, we show that grapefruit-derived nanovectors (GNV) coated with inflammatory-related receptor enriched membranes of activated leukocytes (IGNVs) are enhanced for homing to inflammatory tumor tissues. Blocking LFA-1 or CXCR1 and CXCR2 on the IGNVs significantly inhibits IGNV homing to the inflammatory tissue. The therapeutic potential of IGNVs was further demonstrated by enhancing the chemotherapeutic effect as shown by inhibition of tumor growth in two tumor models and inhibiting the inflammatory effects of dextran sulfate sodium-induced mouse colitis. The fact that IGNVs are capable of homing to inflammatory tissue and that chemokines are overexpressed in diseased human tissue provides the rationale for using IGNVs to more directly deliver therapeutic agents to inflammatory tumor sites and the rationale for the use of IGNVs as treatment for certain cancers in personalized medicine.",

METHODS: Wistar rats [250-300 g body weight (BW)] were divided into eight groups (n = 7). Group 1 animals were orally treated with 3.0 ml/kg BW of distilled water for 60 days, while groups 3, 4, 5, 6 were similarly treated with 3.0 ml/kg BW of GFJ. Groups 4 and 7 as well as 2, 5, 6 and 8 were given 45.0 and 60.0 mg/kg BW intraperitoneal injections streptozotocin, respectively, while groups 2 and 6 animals were additionally injected with insulin (4.0 units/kg, S.C., b.d), respectively. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glucose tolerance tests were done. Hepatic glycogen content and glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activities were measured in homogenized liver tissues. RESULTS: Diabetic rats, groups 2 and 4-8 exhibited significantly reduced weight gain but increased polydipsia compared to controls. FBG was significantly increased in diabetic rats compared to controls but were significantly improved in GFJ-treated-compared to non-treated-diabetic rats. Similarly, diabetic rats showed significant glucose intolerance compared to controls which was improved by GFJ treatment. GFJ treatment did not improve fasting plasma insulin in diabetic rats. GFJ treatment significantly elevated glucokinase activity and hepatic glycogen concentrations but suppressed the activities of G6Pase and PEPCK, respectively, in diabetic animals. CONCLUSION: These findings show that GFJ is not insulinotropic but improves glucose intolerance in diabetic rats by suppressing hepatic gluconeogenesis.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is characterized by an increased production of inflammatory markers. High levels of circulating free fatty acids and chronic inflammation lead to increased oxidative stress, contributing to the development of insulin resistance (IR). Recent studies have focused on the potential use of flavonoids for obesity management due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study was designed to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of helichrysum and grapefruit extracts in overweight insulin-resistant rats. Thirty-eight male Wistar rats were randomly distributed in two groups: control group (n=8) and high-fat sucrose (HFS) group (n=30). After 22 days of ad libitum water and food access, the rats fed HFS diet changed to standard diet and were reassigned into three groups (n=10 each group): nonsupplemented, helichrysum extract (2 g/kg bw), and grapefruit extract (1 g/kg bw) administered for 5 weeks. Rats supplemented with both extracts gained less body weight during the 5-week period of treatment, showed lower serum insulin levels and liver TBARS levels. Leptin/adiponectin ratio, as an indicator of IR, was lower in both extract-administered groups. These results were accompanied by a reduction in TNFα gene expression in epididymal adipose tissue and intestinal mucosa, and TLR2 expression in intestinal mucosa. Helichrysum and grapefruit extracts might be used as complement hypocaloric diets in weight loss treatment. Both extracts helped to reduce weight gain, hyperinsulinemia, and IR, improved inflammation markers, and decreased the HFS diet-induced oxidative stress in insulin-resistant rats.",

This study aimed to create a DFU model that could be used as a learning tool for trainees. METHODS: In a pilot study, a penny-sized circle was drawn onto an orange to simulate a DFU. This was then critiqued by podiatrists, and the feedback received was used to create a grapefruit model with irregular shape. All podiatrists supported the switch to a grapefruit model due to improved contrast between skin and fruit. This grapefruit model was then reassessed by 50 podiatrists from the North West of England. Two freely available computer programs were assessed to measure the area debrided, and a depth scale was used to determine the depth debrided. A questionnaire was completed by the podiatrists as to the utility of the model. RESULTS: A DFU was successfully simulated using a grapefruit and plastic template. After debridement, debrided area and depth were calculated using Image J and a depth score. Podiatrists rated this model for its utility as a training tool on a continuous rating scale with an average score of 61.9%. CONCLUSIONS: This model has potential for development as it is inexpensive and easily accessible. This model's fidelity could be bolstered by using more accurate techniques for area and depth measurement. More research is needed to determine the superiority or inferiority of this model to previous simulated DFU models.",

      "abstract": "Persistent activation of signal transducers and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has been closely related to growth, survival, proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis of various cancer cells, and thus its inhibition can be considered a potential therapeutic strategy. In this study, we investigated the role of bergamottin (BGM) obtained from grapefruit juice in abrogating the constitutive STAT3 activation in multiple myeloma (MM) cells. This suppression was mediated through the inhibition of phosphorylation of Janus-activated kinase (JAK) 1/2 and c-Src. Pervanadate reversed the BGM induced down-regulation of STAT3 activation, suggesting the involvement of a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP). Furthermore, BGM induced the expression of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, and gene silencing of the SHP-1 by small interfering RNA abolished the ability of BGM to inhibit STAT3 activation, suggesting a critical role for SHP-1 in the action of BGM. BGM also downregulated the expression of STAT3-regulated gene products such as COX-2, VEGF, cyclin D1, survivin, IAP-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xl in MM cells. This correlated with induction of substantial apoptosis as indicated by an increase in the sub-G1 cell population and caspase-3 induced PARP cleavage. Also, this agent significantly potentiated the apoptotic effects of bortezomib and thalidomide in MM cells. Overall, these results suggest that BGM is a novel blocker of STAT3 activation pathway thus may have a potential in therapy of MM and other cancers.",

      "abstract": "This review summarizes the effects of olfactory stimulation with grapefruit and lavender oils on autonomic nerve activity and physiological function. Olfactory stimulation with the scent of grapefruit oil (GFO) increases the activity of sympathetic nerves that innervate white and brown adipose tissues, the adrenal glands, and the kidneys, decreases the activity of the gastric vagal nerve in rats and mice. This results in an increase in lipolysis, thermogenesis, and blood pressure, and a decrease in food intake. Olfactory stimulation with the scent of lavender oil (LVO) elicits the opposite changes in nerve activity and physiological variables. Olfactory stimulation with scent of limonene, a component of GFO, and linalool, a component of LVO, has similar effects to stimulation with GFO and LVO, respectively. The histamine H1-receptor antagonist, diphenhydramine, abolishes all GFO-induced changes in nerve activity and physiological variables, and the hitstamine H3-receptor antagonist, thioperamide, eliminates all LVO-induced changes. Lesions to the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and anosmic treatment with ZnSO4 also abolish all GFO- and LVO-induced changes. These findings indicate that limonene and linalool might be the active substances in GFO and LVO, and suggest that the suprachiasmatic nucleus and histamine are involved in mediating the GFO- and LVO-induced changes in nerve activity and physiological variables.",

Carotenoids and flavonoids were significantly higher after 16 weeks in fruits stored at 11°C. Low temperature storage (2°C and CD) helped to retain ascorbic acid for a longer period (12 weeks). Higher furocoumarins and taste scores along with less decay development were observed in CD fruits. Conditioning treatment can be utilized to reduce CI and to maintain taste and certain bioactive compounds of grapefruits during prolonged storage at low temperature. However, for a short storage period, 11°C temperature is more effective.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Grapefruit juice impacts the metabolism of a number of drugs via inhibition of a variety of metabolic enzymes. This study evaluated the impact of grapefruit juice on the antiplatelet activity of a loading dose and 7 days of maintenance therapy with clopidogrel. METHODS: Healthy volunteers participated in two separate treatment protocols. The first protocol included a single 300 mg loading dose of clopidogrel and the second protocol included maintenance therapy with clopidogrel 75 mg given for 7 consecutive days. In both protocols, subjects were randomized to take clopidogrel with grapefruit juice or with tap water. At 6 h after the loading dose and at 6 h after the last maintenance dose of clopidogrel, a P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) value using the VerifyNow® P2Y12 assay was determined. A PRU value > 235 was defined as high on-treatment platelet reactivity (defined as clopidogrel hyporesponse). RESULTS: Fourteen subjects completed the loading dose protocol while 17 subjects completed the maintenance dose protocol. Following administration of the loading dose, the mean PRUs with grapefruit juice and tap water were 235.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 210.4-260.0) and 177.4 (95% CI: 141.6-213.2), respectively (P = 0.001). Following administration of the loading dose, the numbers of subjects with a PRU > 235 with grapefruit juice and tap water were 9 (64%) and 3 (21%), respectively (P = 0.05). In the maintenance dose protocol, the mean PRUs with grapefruit juice and tap water were 212.4 (95% CI: 175.8-249.0) and 186.1 (95% CI: 149.6-222.7), respectively (P = 0.059). In the maintenance dose protocol, the proportions of patients with a PRU > 235 with grapefruit juice and tap water were 9 (53%) and 4 (23%), respectively (P = 0.16). DISCUSSION: Compared to tap water, grapefruit juice significantly increased the mean PRU in patients following a 300 mg loading dose of clopidogrel. The increase in mean PRU after 7 days of a 75 mg/day maintenance dose of clopidogrel was also increased by grapefruit juice, but the magnitude of the increase was not statistically significant. The proportion of subjects with high on-treatment platelet reactivity with clopidogrel after ingestion with grapefruit juice was not significant during either the loading or maintenance dose. The results of our study are insufficient to reach a valid conclusion concerning an interaction between clopidogrel and grapefruit juice."

Grapefruit juice constituents potently inactivate intestinal CYP3A4 and have been shown to inhibit CYP2C19 as well. In a randomized crossover study, 14 healthy volunteers ingested 200 ml of grapefruit juice or water three times daily for 3 days. On day 3, they ingested a single 600-mg dose of clopidogrel. Grapefruit juice reduced the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of the active metabolite of clopidogrel to 13% of the control (range 11-17%, P < 0.001) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 3 h to 14% (range 12-17%, P < 0.001) of the control, but it had no significant effect on the parent clopidogrel. Moreover, grapefruit juice markedly decreased the platelet-inhibitory effect of clopidogrel, as assessed with the VerifyNow P2Y12 test in two of the participants. In conclusion, concomitant use of grapefruit juice may impair the efficacy of clopidogrel. Therefore, the use of grapefruit juice is best avoided during clopidogrel therapy.",

      "abstract": "Individuals with obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, in part due to heightened inflammatory/oxidative processes. Results from epidemiologic and experimental studies suggest that citrus, and grapefruit in particular, may have a role in promoting vascular health, although clinical trial data are lacking. Here, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory/antioxidant effects of habitual grapefruit consumption in 69 overweight/obese men and women and in a subsample of participants with MetS (n = 29). Participants were randomly assigned to either a grapefruit group in which they consumed a low bioactive diet plus 1.5 grapefruit/d for 6 wk (n = 37, n = 14 with MetS) or to a control condition in which a low bioactive diet devoid of citrus was consumed (n = 32, n = 15 with MetS). Plasma soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and urinary F2-isoprostanes were evaluated before and after the intervention phase. F2-isoprostane concentrations were not different in the grapefruit versus control arm after the intervention (12.4 ± 6.4 vs. 15.9 ± 9.0 ng/mg creatinine, P = 0.16), whereas plasma hsCRP concentrations tended to be lower in the grapefruit versus control arm postintervention (2.1 ± 1.5 vs. 2.8 ± 2.0 mg/L, P = 0.09). In adults with MetS, grapefruit consumption tended to result in lower postintervention F2-isoprostane concentrations compared with the control condition (12.0 ± 4.5 vs. 18.3 ± 10.9 ng/mg creatinine, P = 0.06). Furthermore, those with high baseline F2-isoprostane concentrations experienced significant reductions in this biomarker in response to grapefruit consumption (P = 0.021). Change in sVCAM-1 concentrations did not vary by treatment arm nor were there differences between arms postintervention. These results suggest that intake of grapefruit twice daily for 6 wk does not significantly reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, although there is a suggestion of favorable modulation of oxidative stress in overweight and obese adults with MetS or those with high baseline urine F2-isoprostane concentrations.",

We conducted a pilot dietary intervention study among healthy postmenopausal volunteers to test whole grapefruit, 2 juices, and 1 grapefruit soda. Fifty-nine participants were recruited through the Love/Avon Army of Women. The study consisted of a 3-wk run-in, 2 wk of grapefruit intake, and a 1-wk wash-out. Eight fasting blood samples were collected. An additional 5 samples drawn at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 10 hr after grapefruit intake were collected during an acute-phase study for 10 women. Serum assays for estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estrone-3-sulfate (E1S), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and sex hormone-binding globulin were conducted. Whole grapefruit intake had significant effects on endogenous E1S. Peak effects were seen at 8 hr, increasing by 26% from baseline. No changes in mean E1 or E2 with whole fruit intake were observed. In contrast, fresh juice, bottled juice, and soda intake all had significant lowering effects on E2. The findings suggest an important interaction between grapefruit intake and endogenous estrogen levels. Because endogenous estrogen levels are associated with breast cancer risk, further research is warranted.",

METHODS: Animals were divided into four groups. Group I was considered as control. Group II was given grapefruit juice at a dose level of 27 mL/kg body weight. Group III was orally administered amiodarone (18 mg/kg body weight) daily for 5 weeks. Animals were sacrificed after 5 weeks of treatment. Bone marrow was collected from the femurs for analysis of chromosomal aberrations and mitotic indices. Testes were removed and stained with H&E for histological examination. Sperms were collected from epidedymis for detection of sperm head abnormalities. Comet assay was used to detect DNA damage. RESULTS: Amiodarone treatment caused a significant increase in the percentage of chromosomal aberrations, decreased the mitotic index and increased DNA damage. The testis showed many histopathological alterations, inhibition of spermatogenesis and morphometric changes. The number of sperm head abnormalities was increased. Treating animals with amiodarone and grapefruit juice caused a reduction in chromosomal aberrations, mitotic index, DNA damage and testicular alterations caused by amiodarone. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicated that grapefruit juice ameliorates the cytotoxicty and testicular alterations induced by amiodarone in albino rats and this is may be due to the potent antioxidant effects of its components.",

We demonstrate the in vivo targeting specificity of grapefruit-derived nanovectors by co-delivering therapeutic agents with folic acid, which in turn leads to significantly increasing targeting efficiency to cells expressing folate receptors. The therapeutic potential of grapefruit-derived nanovectors was further demonstrated by enhancing the chemotherapeutic inhibition of tumour growth in two tumour animal models. Grapefruit-derived nanovectors are less toxic than nanoparticles made of synthetic lipids and, when injected intravenously into pregnant mice, do not pass the placental barrier, suggesting that they may be a useful tool for drug delivery.",

In comparison with conventional solvent extraction (CSE), UAE showed a pronounced greater extraction yield and reduced extraction time effectively with a peak value at 30 min. The extraction yield was significantly influenced by temperature and the optimum condition was 30 °C. The extraction yield increased with increasing of solvent/material ratio until equilibrium was arrived at the optimal ratio of 3:1 (mL/g). The extraction yield increased first and then decreased with an increase in ultrasonic intensity. The extraction yield of UAE increased with the increase of duty cycle, whereas pulsed ultrasound with proper intervals was more efficient than continuous ultrasonication. The degradation via isomerisation of all-trans-lycopene under ultrasonic treatment was also observed with the formation of 9,13'-di-cis-, 9,13-di-cis-, 15-cis-, 13-cis- and 9-cis-lycopene isomers which were tentatively identified by HPLC-PAD.",

      "abstract": "Since the late 1980s, grapefruit juice has been known to affect the metabolism of certain drugs. Several serious adverse effects involving drug interactions with grapefruit juice have been published in detail. The components of grapefruit juice vary considerably depending on the variety, maturity and origin of the fruit, local climatic conditions, and the manufacturing process. No single component accounts for all observed interactions. Other grapefruit products are also occasionally implicated, including preserves, lyophylised grapefruit juice, powdered whole grapefruit, grapefruit seed extract, and zest. Clinical reports of drug interactions with grapefruit juice are supported by pharmacokinetic studies, each usually involving about 10 healthy volunteers, in which the probable clinical consequences were extrapolated from the observed plasma concentrations. Grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A4, the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme most often involved in drug metabolism. This increases plasma concentrations of the drugs concerned, creating a risk of overdose and dose-dependent adverse effects. Grapefruit juice also inhibits several other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, but they are less frequently implicated in interactions with clinical consequences. Drugs interacting with grapefruit and inducing serious clinical consequences (confirmed or very probable) include: immunosuppressants, some statins, benzodiazepines, most calcium channel blockers, indinavir and carbamazepine. There are large inter-individual differences in enzyme efficiency. Along with the variable composition of grapefruit juice, this makes it difficult to predict the magnitude and clinical consequences of drug interactions with grapefruit juice in a given patient. There is increasing evidence that transporter proteins such as organic anion transporters and P-glycoprotein are involved in interactions between drugs and grapefruit juice. In practice, numerous drugs interact with grapefruit juice. Although only a few reports involving severe clinical consequences have been published, they suggest that grapefruit juice should be avoided during drug therapy, especially when the drug has a narrow therapeutic margin or carries a risk of serious dose-dependent adverse effects. Patients should be informed of this risk whenever a drug is prescribed or dispensed.",

      "abstract": "Ethylene is commercially used for artificial degreening of early season grapefruits. The present study investigated the effect of degreening and storage period on Star Ruby grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macf.) bioactive compounds. Freshly harvested grapefruits were degreened in commercial packing shed for 60h using 2ppm of ethylene at a constant temperature of 20°C. Both degreened and non-degreened (control) fruits were stored at 10°C for 21days and later transferred to 20°C for a period of 14days to simulate shipment and retail store market conditions. Bioactive compounds including carotenoids, limonoids, flavonoids and furocoumarins were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography. Nomilin was significantly higher (P<0.05) in degreened fruits at 35days after storage. In contrast, flavonoids such as narirutin, naringin and poncirin were significantly (P<0.05) lower in degreened fruits at 35days after storage. Degreening treatment reduced the levels of deacetyl nomilinic acid glucoside and bergamottin after 35days of storage; however, it had no significant effect on total soluble solids, decay, fruit softening, taste, odour, ascorbic acid, β-carotene, lycopene, limonin, neohesperidin, didymin, 6,7-dihydroxybergamottin, 5-geranyloxy-7-methoxycoumarin and radical scavenging activity. Therefore, degreening could be utilized to enhance the grapefruit aesthetic quality, with minimal effect on nutritional quality.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The labeling for colchicine (indicated for acute gout flares or prophylaxis) includes strict advisories regarding drug-drug and drug-food interactions, including warnings against consuming grapefruit or grapefruit juice during treatment. Two of the furocoumarins in grapefruit juice and Seville orange juice can inhibit intestinal cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozyme 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (involved in colchicine metabolism and transport). Severe toxicities in patients consuming these juices while taking other drugs metabolized through these pathways have been reported. OBJECTIVE: Two Phase I studies assessed the effects of multiple daily consumptions of Seville orange juice or grapefruit juice on the pharmacokinetic properties of colchicine in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Healthy volunteers were enrolled in 2 open-label, Phase I studies. Undiluted juice (240 mL) was administered twice daily for 4 days. Pharmacokinetic data were obtained following a single 0.6-mg dose of colchicine before the administration of juice and again following a single 0.6-mg dose of colchicine on the final day of juice administration. In each study, blood samples for pharmacokinetics were collected before dosing with colchicine and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose. All subjects were monitored for adverse events (AEs) throughout the confinement portion of the study and were queried at the outpatient visits. AEs were coded according to corresponding MedDRA-coded system organ classes. RESULTS: Forty-four subjects received either grapefruit juice (72.7% male; 90.9% white) or Seville orange juice (62.5% female; 100% white). Although it is considered to be a moderate concentration-dependent CYP3A4 inhibitor, grapefruit juice did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetic parameters of colchicine. When colchicine was administered with Seville orange juice, a moderate inhibitor, C(max) and AUC were decreased by ∼24% and ∼20%, respectively. Seville orange juice also caused, on average, a 1-hour delay in T(max). Colchicine in combination with grapefruit or Seville orange juice was well tolerated. There were no significant treatment-related AEs reported, and the most likely AEs were general gastrointestinal events. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to label warnings based on the literature, grapefruit juice did not affect the pharmacokinetics of colchicine. Seville orange juice paradoxically reduced absorption of colchicine and increased T(max), but the clinical significance of this is unknown. Contrary to the expected effects of inhibiting the enzymes that metabolize colchicine, neither juice increased exposure to colchicine. However, the absence of a positive control in these studies dictates that caution should be used when applying these results clinically. ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT00960193 and NCT00984009.",

      "abstract": "The present study examined the survival of Salmonella Typhimurium and its adherence to intestinal epithelial cells following inoculation into grapefruit juice and apple cider. Both liquids significantly inactivated S. Typhimurium (0.8-2.2 log reduction compared to the control); surviving Salmonella in grapefruit juice was 1.0-1.4 log lower than in apple cider at 24h incubation. Grapefruit juice contains the antimicrobial substances naringin (NAR) and naringenin (NGE); however, the effect of grapefruit juice on growth and adherence of S. Typhimurium appeared not to be related to NAR. NGE at 100-200 μg/mL reduced the adherence of Salmonella to epithelial cells by 57% and 73% compared to the control (TSB at pH 7.4) after 24 h treatment, but stimulated rather than inhibited growth of Salmonella. However, when NGE at 200 μg/mL was added to TSB at pH 3.5 Salmonella survival and adherence to intestinal epithelial cells were reduced by 2.5 log and 79%, respectively, compared to the control (TSB at pH 3.5). Addition of NGE to apple cider also caused a slight reduction in the survival of S. Typhimurium, but did not enhance the inhibitory effect on adherence due to apple cider. These data showed that low pH augmented the inhibitory effect of NGE on growth and adherence of Salmonella to intestinal epithelial cells, but the mechanism of the observed augmentative effect is not clear. Understanding the mechanism of the interaction between low pH and NGE and its inhibitory effect on growth and adherence of enteric pathogens may lead to the development of new antibacterial agents.",

Ritonavir (RTV) is a known inhibitor of both P-gp and CYP3A and is co-administered with LPV in anti-HIV therapy. Grapefruit juice (GFJ) is known to inhibit CYP3A and has conflicting effects, ranging from activation to inhibition, on P-gp. In this research work, the effects of GFJ and RTV on the pharmacokinetics of LPV were compared in rats. A mechanistic evaluation was undertaken using various in vitro and ex vivo studies to support the in vivo pharmacokinetic data. The plasma levels of LPV were found to increase significantly upon co-administration with GFJ in single dose as well as multidose pretreatment studies. Similar, but marginally higher, results were observed upon co-administration of LPV with RTV. No significant change in t(max) was observed in the various treatment groups. The apparent permeability of LPV in the ileum increased significantly after the pre-incubation with GFJ and RTV compared with no pre-incubation. The GFJ and RTV showed a significant and similar inhibitory effect on rat intestinal microsomes in the metabolism of LPV. The GFJ was equally effective as RTV in increasing the bioavailability of LPV.",

      "abstract": "Folklore has suggested that consuming grapefruit may promote weight control. Sparse data exist to support this hypothesis, although there is some evidence of health promotion effects with regard to blood pressure control and modulation of circulating lipids. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to prospectively evaluate the role of grapefruit in reducing body weight and blood pressure and in promoting improvements in the lipid profile in overweight adults (N = 74). Following a 3-week washout diet low in bioactive-rich fruits and vegetables, participants were randomized to either the control diet (n = 32) or daily grapefruit (n = 42) in the amount of one half of a fresh Rio-Red grapefruit with each meal (3× daily) for 6 weeks. No differences between group in weight, blood pressure, or lipids were demonstrated. Grapefruit consumption was associated with modest weight loss (-0.61 ± 2.23 kg, P = .097), a significant reduction in waist circumference (-2.45 ± 0.60 cm, P = .0002), and a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (-3.21 ± 10.13 mm Hg, P = .03) compared with baseline values. Improvements were observed in circulating lipids of those consuming grapefruit, with total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein significantly decreasing by -11.7 mg/dL (P = .002) and -18.7 mg/dL (P < .001), respectively, compared with baseline values. This study suggests that consumption of grapefruit daily for 6 weeks does not significantly decrease body weight, lipids, or blood pressure as compared with the control condition. However, the improvements in blood pressure and lipids demonstrated in the intervention group suggest that grapefruit should be further evaluated in the context of obesity and cardiovascular disease prevention.",

Among the 162 patients who were interviewed, 59 (36%) reported grapefruit consumption (regardless form or frequency) and 11 (7%) were prescribed a treatment with a risk of fruit-drug interaction. No ADE could be related to an interaction with grapefruit. Calcium channel blockers and HMG-coA-reductase inhibitors mostly accounted for drugs at risk of interaction in grapefruit consumers. CONCLUSION: These results give evidence of the sizeable risk of grapefruit-drug interaction in the prescriptions of patients admitted to a medical ED, with a high proportion of commonly used medicines but poor clinical consequences.",

Some patients report benefit from the use of various nutritional compounds. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of licorice and grapefruit juice (GFJ) on the absorption and metabolism of cortisone acetate (CA). DESIGN: Patients (n=17) with AD on stable CA replacement therapy were recruited from the outpatient clinic at Haukeland University Hospital, Norway. They were assessed on their ordinary CA medication and following two 3-day periods of co-administration of licorice or GFJ. METHODS: Time series of glucocorticoids (GCs) in serum and saliva were obtained, and GCs in 24 h urine samples were determined. The main outcome measure was the area under the curve (AUC) for serum cortisol in the first 2.6 h after orally administered CA. RESULTS: Compared with the ordinary treatment, the median AUC for serum cortisol increased with licorice (53 783 vs 50 882, P<0.05) and GFJ (60 661 vs 50 882, P<0.05). Median cortisol levels in serum were also elevated 2.6 h after tablet ingestion (licorice 223 vs 186 nmol/l, P<0.05; GFJ 337 vs 186 nmol/l, P<0.01). Licorice increased the median urinary cortisol/cortisone ratio (0.43 vs 0.21, P<0.00001), whereas GFJ increased the (allo-tetrahydrocortisol+tetrahydrocortisol)/tetrahydrocortisone ratio (0.55 vs 0.43, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Licorice and in particular GFJ increased cortisol available to tissues in the hours following oral CA administration. Both patients and physicians should be aware of these interactions.",

In vitro studies indicated that tolvaptan was a CYP3A4 substrate. METHODS: A single-center, randomized, crossover trial of 60-mg tolvaptan with 240 mL of water or with 240 mL of reconstituted grapefruit juice (washout period of 72 h between doses) was conducted in 20 healthy subjects. Blood samples for tolvaptan plasma concentrations were obtained for 48 h postdose. RESULTS: All subjects completed the trial. Following co-administration with grapefruit juice, tolvaptan concentrations were elevated compared with tolvaptan alone for only 16 h postdose; consequently, the mean elimination half-life of tolvaptan was unchanged, 5.7 vs 5.1 h respectively. The mean maximal plasma concentration (C(max)) and the area under the curve (AUC(∞)) of tolvaptan were increased 1.86- and 1.56-fold respectively when co-administered with grapefruit juice. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that grapefruit juice increases the bioavailability of tolvaptan, but does not affect its systemic elimination. The adverse event profile was consistent with the aquaretic effect of tolvaptan as urinary frequency, thirst, and dry mouth were the most frequently reported events.",

      "abstract": "Soil applications of inducers of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, or acibenzolar-S-methyl, at various rates and application frequencies, were evaluated for control of citrus canker caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri in a field trial of 3- and 4-year-old 'Ray Ruby' grapefruit trees in southeastern Florida. Reduction of foliar incidence of canker produced by one, two, or four soil applications of imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and acibenzolar-S-methyl was compared with 11 foliar sprays of copper hydroxide and streptomycin applied at 21-day intervals. In the 2008 and 2009 crop seasons, canker incidence on each set of vegetative flushes was assessed as the percentage of the total leaves with lesions. By the end of the 2008 season, despite above-average rainfall and a tropical storm event, all treatments significantly reduced foliar incidence of citrus canker on the combined spring-summer-fall flushes. Sprays of copper hydroxide and streptomycin were effective for reducing canker incidence on shoot flushes produced throughout the season compared with the untreated control, whereas soil-applied SAR inducers reduced foliar disease depending on rate, frequency, and timing of application. Except for the treatment of four applications of acibenzolar-S-methyl at 0.2 g a.i. per tree or two applications of imidacloprid, SAR inducers were ineffective for reducing foliar disease on the flushes that were present during the tropical storm. In 2009, all treatments significantly reduced the incidence of foliar canker on the combined spring-summer-fall flushes but not all treatments of spring-summer flushes with SAR inducers were effective compared with the untreated control. Hence, depending on rate, frequency, and timing of application, soil-applied SAR inducers reduced incidence of canker on foliar flushes of young grapefruit trees under epidemic conditions."

      "abstract": "AIM: To determine whether customary exposure to grapefruit juice (GFJ) alters serum concentrations, effectiveness, and potential adverse effects of atorvastatin in patients requiring the medication. METHODS: Patients receiving extended treatment with atorvastatin (10, 20 or 40 mg day(-1)) at a stable dose received 300 ml day(-1) of 100% GFJ for a period of 90 days. One cohort of patients (arm A, n= 60) continued on their current dose of atorvastatin; the second cohort (arm B, n= 70) reduced the daily dose by 50%. Serum atorvastatin, lipid profile, liver functions, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) were measured at baseline and at 30, 60, and 90 days after starting GFJ. RESULTS: In Arm A patients, co-ingestion of GFJ significantly elevated serum atorvastatin by 19% to 26% compared with baseline. Changes in lipid profile relative to baseline were negligible. There were no adverse effects on liver function tests or CPK. In arm B patients, serum atorvastatin declined by 12% to 25% compared to baseline, with a small but significant unfavourable effect in serum lipid profile. There were no adverse effects on liver function tests or CPK. CONCLUSION: In patients on extended stable atorvastatin treatment, addition of daily GFJ in typical quantities slightly elevates serum atorvastatin concentrations, but has no meaningful effect on the serum lipid profile, and causes no detectable adverse liver or muscle effects. Reduction of atorvastatin dosage when moderate amounts of GFJ are co-ingested does not appear to be necessary.",

      "abstract": "Several foodborne human pathogens, when exposed to harsh conditions, enter viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state; however, still open is the question whether VBNC pathogens could be a risk for public health, because, potentially, they can resuscitate. Moreover, cultural methods for food safety control were not able to detect VBNC forms of foodborne bacteria. Particularly, it has not been established whether food chemophysical characteristics can induce VBNC state in contaminating pathogen bacterial populations, especially in food, such as salads and fresh fruit juices, not subjected to any decontamination treatment. In this preliminary study, we intentionally contaminated grapefruit juice to determine whether pathogen bacteria could enter VNBC state. In fact, grapefruit juice contains natural antimicrobial compounds, has an average pH of about 3 and low content in carbohydrates. Such characteristics make grapefruit juice a harsh environment for microbial survival. For this purpose, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 7644, and Shigella flexneri ATCC 12022, at two different inoculum sizes, have been used. Viability by the LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability kit and culturability by plate counts assay were monitored, whereas \"resuscitation\" of nonculturable populations was attempted by inoculation in nutrient-rich media. The data showed that L. monocytogenes lost both culturability and viability and did not resuscitate within 24 h independently on inoculum size, whereas E. coli O157:H7 was able to resuscitate after 24 h but did not after 48 h. Salmonella Typhimurium and S. flexneri, depending on inoculum size, lost culturability but maintained viability and were able to resuscitate; moreover, S. flexneri was still able to form colonies after 48 h at high inoculum size. In conclusion, entry into VBNC state differs on the species, depending, in turn, on inoculum size and time of incubation.",

      "abstract": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine kinase that is implicated in the control of energy metabolism and is considered to be a molecular target for the suppression of obesity and the treatment of metabolic syndrome. Here, we identified and characterized nootkatone, a constituent of grapefruit, as a naturally occurring AMPK activator. Nootkatone induced an increase in AMPKalpha1 and -alpha2 activity along with an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio and an increase the phosphorylation of AMPKalpha and the downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), in C(2)C(12) cells. Nootkatone-induced activation of AMPK was possibly mediated both by LKB1 and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase. Nootkatone also upregulated PPARgamma coactivator-1alpha in C(2)C(12) cells and C57BL/6J mouse muscle. In addition, administration of nootkatone (200 mg/kg body wt) significantly enhanced AMPK activity, accompanied by LKB1, AMPK, and ACC phosphorylation in the liver and muscle of mice. Whole body energy expenditure evaluated by indirect calorimetry was also increased by nootkatone administration. Long-term intake of diets containing 0.1% to 0.3% (wt/wt) nootkatone significantly reduced high-fat and high-sucrose diet-induced body weight gain, abdominal fat accumulation, and the development of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia in C57BL/6J mice. Furthermore, endurance capacity, evaluated as swimming time to exhaustion in BALB/c mice, was 21% longer in mice fed 0.2% nootkatone than in control mice. These findings indicate that long-term intake of nootkatone is beneficial toward preventing obesity and improving physical performance and that these effects are due, at least in part, to enhanced energy metabolism through AMPK activation in skeletal muscle and liver.",

      "abstract": "Recent clinical studies have indicated that grapefruit juice (GFJ) improves insulin resistance and reduces weight gain in humans. The effect of GFJ on glucose tolerance and metformin-induced lactic acidosis in normal, non-diabetic in rats is hereby investigated. Three groups (A, B, C) of 20 male Wistar rats each, were treated with stepwise, escalated oral doses of 0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 (group A), and 3.0 ml/kg body weight (groups B and C) of GFJ. Group C rats additionally received 250 mg/kg body weight of metformin. All the animals were sacrificed after 14 days of treatment. Fasting blood glucose levels were significantly (P < 0.0001) lower in GFJ-treated test (2.9 +/- 0.4 mmol/L) compared with control (3.7 +/- 0.39 mmol/L) rats, but 1.5-hr plasma insulin levels were similar. GFJ alone or in combination with metformin, significantly (P < 0.05) lowered blood glucose levels compared with control animals. Blood lactic acid levels were similar in GFJ-treated test (2.81 +/- 1.4 mmol/L) and control (2.54 +/- 0.7 mmol/L) rats, respectively, but were significantly increased (P = 0.0079) in rats that were treated with either metformin alone (5.38 +/- 2.53 mmol/L) or in combination with GFJ (8.31 +/- 3.48 mmol/L). Metformin concentration in liver tissue was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in GFJ-treated (397 +/- 19 microg/g) than in control (280 +/- 15 microg/g) rats, respectively. Plasma metformin levels were comparable between the control (95 +/- 8.1 microg/ml) and GFJ-treated test (108 +/- 20 microg/ml) rats, respectively. Liver tissue metformin concentrations and plasma lactic acid levels showed significant correlation in both control (P = 0.0122; r(2) = 0.9080) and GFJ-treated test rats (P = 0.0005; r(2) = 0.9893). Although GFJ may be beneficial to diabetic patients, it may exacerbate lactic acidosis in diabetic patients taking metformin concurrently.",
