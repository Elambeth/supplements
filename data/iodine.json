      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The 2015 American Thyroid Association pediatric differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) guidelines recommend posttherapy whole body scan (PTS) 4-7 days after (Iodine-131) I-131 activity administration. There is no recommendation of timing of performing a diagnostic whole-body scan (Dx-WBS). However, this 4-7 day time frame for PTS lacks a solid basis and is essentially arbitrary. This is especially crucial as it has the potential to significantly impact patient management. Our primary goal in this study was to establish the optimal timing for both Dx-WBS and PTS in pediatric and young adult patients with DTC. METHODS: The DTC patients aged ≤21 years underwent serial whole-body scan (WBS) at 24 h, 48 h, and/or 72 h or more after the administration of diagnostic and therapeutic activities of I-131. The utility of Dx-WBS and PTS was assessed based on the identification of new lesions that could potentially influence the prescribed therapeutic activity of I-131. The optimal timing for acquiring Dx-WBS and PTS was determined based on when the first lesion appeared in the I-131 WBS. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients (27 males and 68 females) with an average age of 17.9 ± 3 years received a 74 MBq I-131 for Dx-WBS. Ten patients (10.5%) showed no uptake in Dx-WBS, thus, no I-131 therapy was given. The remaining 85 patients received a therapeutic activity of 1.11-5.55 GBq I-131 based on the extent of their disease. The serial Dx-WBS or PTS showed no additional lesions in patients with thyroid remnants. However, additional nodes were detected in 2/32 patients in the ≥48 h Dx-WBS, and 1/32 patients in the known nodal disease patients, which were not clinically relevant. Importantly, 72 h PTS picked up pulmonary metastases in 17.6% (3 out of 17) of patients, which were missed in serial Dx-WBS. However, >72 h PTS did not have additional value. CONCLUSION: I-131 Dx-WBS is best to be performed at 48 h, and PTS at 72 h in pediatric and young adult patients with DTC."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hyperthyroidism can mask concurrent chronic kidney disease in cats, and no accurate biomarkers are available to predict which cats will develop renal azotemia after radioiodine (131I) treatment. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the potential of serum and urinary metabolites and metabolite ratios to predict post-131I renal azotemia in hyperthyroid cats. ANIMALS: Hyperthyroid cats (n = 31), before and (3-12 months) after treatment with 131I at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine (Ghent University, Belgium). METHODS: Retrospective study. Optimized and validated feline extraction and analysis protocols were employed for metabolic profiling of urine and serum samples using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. A dual strategy of cross-validated univariate and penalized multivariate logistic regression was applied to determine predictivity (i.e., area under the curve [AUC], accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) of individual biomarkers and panels. RESULTS: All hyperthyroid cats were non-azotemic before 131I administration. After 131I treatment, 7 cats became persistently (≥ 2 timepoints) azotemic while 24 remained non-azotemic. Urinary asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) was identified as a pivotal predictor of post-131I azotemia in both univariate and multivariate modeling. When employed as a standalone biomarker, an AUC of 0.851, accuracy of 0.903, sensitivity of 0.714, and specificity of 0.958 were achieved. While pre-treatment USG was significantly different (P = 0.002) between both groups, it did not show enhanced prediction over ADMA, nor in multivariate modeling. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Urinary ADMA can accurately predict post-131I azotemia in hyperthyroid cats becoming euthyroid after 131I treatment. These findings can aid clinicians in managing owner expectations and modify treatment plans.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2019 to April 2024, the eligible patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer after standard treatment failure received bronchial arterial chemoembolization/infusion combined with iodine-125 brachytherapy, were included in this retrospective study. Objective response rate, disease control rate, progression-free survival, overall survival and adverse events served as the main indicators of assessment. According to the intervention timing of intervention for this combination therapy, they were divided into the early intervention subgroup and the late intervention subgroup. Statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 3.5.3). RESULTS: A total of 45 patients with the median age 66 years (11 women) were enrolled in this study. The objective response rate of three months after the combination therapy was 71.11% and disease control rate was 95.56%. The median progression-free survival of this cohort was 12 months and the median overall survival was 20 months. The progression-free survival (15.5 vs. 9 months, P = 0.007) and overall survival (27.5 vs. 15 months, P < 0.001) in the early intervention subgroup was significantly better than that in the late intervention subgroup. No severe complications occurred. CONCLUSION: For advanced non-small cell lung cancer after standard treatment failure, the combination of bronchial arterial chemoembolization/infusion and iodine-125 brachytherapy is a promising salvage therapy with good efficacy and safety.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with conventional treatments often limited by radiation resistance, systemic toxicity and poor outcomes in advanced stages. Iodine-125 (I-125) seed implantation, combined with chemotherapy and immunotherapy, has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy, but its efficacy and safety compared with conventional external beam radiotherapy combined with systemic therapies remain unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to synthesise the available evidence to evaluate the comparative benefits and risks of these treatment modalities. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers will independently search seven databases-PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library-for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). These RCTs should compare the efficacy and safety of I-125 seed implantations combined with chemotherapy and immunotherapy against chemoradiotherapy combined with immunotherapy in patients with NSCLC. The risk of bias in the included studies will be evaluated using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool V.2. Data synthesis will be conducted using RevMan software. Trial sequential analysis will be applied to the primary outcomes. Additionally, subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the robustness of the findings. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required because this study is a secondary analysis of existing data. We will disseminate the findings through peer-reviewed publications.

METHODS: A bibliographic research was conducted focusing on the most commonly consumed foods in Brazil. Iodine quantification was derived from both national and international food composition tables, with an emphasis on sources indicating the highest concentrations of this microelement. The foods were organized into categories, and their iodine levels were presented in micrograms per 100 grams of food. RESULTS: The compiled list includes foods classified into categories such as cereals, legumes, vegetables, fruits, flours, oils, fats, meats, dairy products, and beverages. Foods with more than 50 μg of iodine per 100 g were identified and classified separately. Based on the findings, marine-derived foods should be avoided, while dairy products and eggs can be consumed, provided substitutions are made. CONCLUSION: Identifying and quantifying low-iodine foods is essential for guiding the LID, making it more effective and better suited to the population's needs. Legumes, vegetables, and most fruits can be consumed in larger quantities, forming the core of the diet."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Although most patients with Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC) have a favorable prognosis, some continue to have elevated serum Thyroglobulin (Tg) levels after surgery and ¹³¹I treatment, classified as a Biochemical Incomplete Response (BIR). According to the 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines, 20% of these patients will develop a Structural Incomplete Response (SIR). Doctors often recommend ¹³¹I retreatment without imaging evidence, hoping for benefits. However, the effectiveness of this treatment strategy is still not supported by evidence. The aim of this study is to explore the potential benefits by comparing Tg levels and their changes in patients who were retreated with 131I and combining them with the results of follow-up assessment using Dynamic Risk Stratification (DRS). METHODS: This retrospective study collected clinical data from patients with PTC who underwent ¹³¹I therapy after surgery at two medical centers. All of them were evaluated for Biochemical Incomplete Response (BIR) after initial treatment. Based on whether they received ¹³¹I retreatment, they were divided into two groups: the retreatment group and the no-retreatment group. Our primary outcome measures included basic clinical data, suppressed Tg, change in Tg levels, and DRS stratification at the last follow-up. The potential benefits of ¹³¹I retreatment were analyzed by comparing the changes in Tg levels and the DRS distribution at the end of follow-up between the two groups. RESULTS: Patients with PTC assessed for BIR after initial therapy showed a greater reduction in Tg at short-term follow-up after ¹³¹I retreatment compared to the no retreatment group (0.84 ng/mL vs. 0.72 ng/mL). The one-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test results were T = 6.001, p < 0.001 and T = 1.378, p = 0.168, respectively. At the end of follow-up, this treatment did not alter the DRS strata composition ratio (R = 3.06, p = 0.39). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for pre-ablation stimulated thyroglobulin (Ps-Tg) predicting non-remission status was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55-0.73), with the highest Youden index (0.26) at a Ps-Tg cutoff of 20.5 ng/mL, corresponding to a sensitivity of 62.6% and a specificity of 63.3%. For the first suppressed Tg (sup-Tg) predicting non-remission, the AUC was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.67-0.84). The highest Youden index (0.40) was achieved at a sup-Tg cutoff of 1.85 ng/mL, corresponding to a sensitivity of 68.9% and a specificity of 70.8%. CONCLUSION: For patients with PTC who received 131I therapy after surgery and are classified as BIR, 131I retreatment may accelerate the decline in Tg levels over time but does not change the DRS distribution. Only few of patients have structural and/or functional lesions detected on the whole-body scan after 131I retreatment. The Ps-Tg and first sup-Tg values after the first ¹³¹I treatment can help predict a non-remission state, with cutoff values of 20.5 ng/mL and 1.85 ng/mL, respectively."

      "abstract": "Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have seen improvements in care; however, outcomes remain poor for certain individuals despite treatment with radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapies and immunotherapy. The present study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of combining 8Spheres microsphere embolization with iodine-125 seed implantation for treating advanced refractory NSCLC. The retrospective analysis included 45 patients with advanced refractory NSCLC. Using the surv_cutpoint function in R, the optimal maximum tumor diameter threshold was determined as 53 mm, dividing patients into two groups: ≤53 mm and >53 mm. The study evaluated the association between treatment regimen, tumor diameter, and progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The findings demonstrated that the experimental group achieved a significantly longer median PFS (12 vs. 10 months; P=0.006) and OS (19 vs. 12 months; P=0.032) compared with the control group. Both the treatment approach and tumor size were identified as independent factors influencing survival. The risk of death was 2.291-fold higher for patients on the control regimen than for those in the experimental group. Similarly, patients with a tumor diameter of >53 mm had a 2.723-fold higher risk of death than those with a tumor diameter of ≤53 mm. Adverse events were mild and resolved in both groups. In summary, the combination of 8Spheres microsphere embolization and iodine-125 seed implantation demonstrate promising clinical outcomes and it may be a viable treatment for advanced refractory NSCLC. Additionally, maximum tumor diameter was strongly associated with patient survival and therefore it may serve as a valuable prognostic indicator to guide treatment decisions."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of radiomics analysis using dual-layer detector spectral CT (DLCT)-derived iodine maps for the preoperative prediction of the Ki-67 proliferation index (PI) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 168 PDAC patients who underwent DLCT examination were included and randomly allocated to the training (n = 118) and validation (n = 50) sets. A clinical model was constructed using independent clinicoradiological features identified through multivariate logistic regression analysis in the training set. The radiomics signature was generated based on the coefficients of selected features from iodine maps in the arterial and portal venous phases of DLCT. Finally, a radiomics-clinical model was developed by integrating the radiomics signature and significant clinicoradiological features. The predictive performance of three models was evaluated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and Decision Curve Analysis. The optimal model was then used to develop a nomogram, with goodness-of-fit evaluated through the calibration curve. RESULTS: The radiomics-clinical model integrating radiomics signature, CA19-9, and CT-reported regional lymph node status demonstrated excellent performance in predicting Ki-67 PI in PDAC, which showed an area under the ROC curve of 0.979 and 0.956 in the training and validation sets, respectively. The radiomics-clinical nomogram demonstrated the improved net benefit and exhibited satisfactory consistency. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study demonstrated the feasibility of using DLCT-derived iodine map-based radiomics to predict Ki-67 PI preoperatively in PDAC patients. While preliminary, our findings highlight the potential of functional imaging combined with radiomics for personalized treatment planning.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify dosiomic features that have a significant impact on biochemical failure (BCF) following low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy treatment using Iodine-125 seeds for prostate cancer and to provide insights into LDR brachytherapy treatment efficacy using a dosiomic approach. METHODS: Between January 2005 and February 2015, 1,205 patients with localized prostate cancer underwent Iodine-125 seed implantation without combined external irradiation. A total of 96 patients were selected for this study, including 48 with BCF and 48 without BCF. The patients were divided into two cohorts: derivation and validation. Dose distribution images (DDs) were calculated from computed tomography (CT) images taken one month after implantation. A total of 1,130 dosiomic features, including shape-and-size, histogram, and texture features, were extracted from these DDs, their wavelet-transformed images, and Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG)-filtered images. The features obtained were categorized into three groups: shape-and-size (S), histogram (H), and texture (T). The Boruta algorithm was used to eliminate less important features. Two analyses were performed: Analysis A performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis using data from the validation cohort to identify significant features. Analysis B generated logistic regression models using derivation cohort data. The accuracy of BCF prediction was assessed using the validation cohort, with performance measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: After the feature reduction process, two, two, and four features remained in the S, H, and T feature groups, respectively. In analysis A, the multivariate logistic regression identified four dominant features, two from each of the S and T groups. In analysis B, the AUC of the logistic regression prediction models using S, H, and all four features were 0.81, 0.77, and 0.86, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Four significant dosiomic features were identified. Notably, three features-elongation, Maximum2DDiameterRow, and wavelet-HHL_Skewness-strongly distinguished patients with favorable prognoses from others. These findings suggest that dosiomic features from postimplant CT and dose distribution may serve as effective factors for evaluating LDR brachytherapy outcomes in patients with prostate cancer.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Dual-Energy Computed Tomography (DECT) in distinguishing malignant from benign cervical lymph nodes in neck carcinoma based on iodine concentration and normalized spectral attenuation (Hounsfield Unit, HU) values. METHODS: Retrospective DECT scan analysis was performed on 52 neck carcinoma patients, analyzing 52 metastatic and 28 reactive lymph nodes. Iodine concentration (mg/mL) and spectral HU values were measured with circular regions of interest on iodine maps. Metastatic nodes included 27 from squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 19 from lymphoma, and 6 from papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). RESULTS: Metastatic lymph nodes had lower iodine levels than reactive nodes (1.45 vs. 1.85 mg/mL, p = 0.011). No significant difference in spectral HU values was found (117 vs. 111 HU, p = 0.328). An iodine threshold of 1.62 mg/mL demonstrated 71% sensitivity and 77% specificity for detecting malignancy (AUC = 0.673, 95% CI: 0.54-0.80, p = 0.011). SCC metastases had lower iodine levels than reactive nodes (1.33 vs. 1.85 mg/mL, p < 0.001), while PTC metastases had higher levels (2.39 vs. 1.85 mg/mL, p = 0.038). CONCLUSION: DECT iodine quantification improves the detection of cervical lymph node metastases, particularly in cases with equivocal size criteria. Incorporating iodine measurements with tumor type knowledge improves diagnostic accuracy, aiding in prognosis and treatment planning."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Juxtapapillary uveal melanomas limit plaque brachytherapy treatment using the standard 2 mm margin and are often excluded from prospective studies thus limiting data on outcomes and complications. We retrospectively evaluated outcomes in this tumor population following primary iodine-125 plaque brachytherapy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review over 30 years of patients treated with iodine-125 plaque brachytherapy for juxtapapillary uveal melanoma at a single center. RESULTS: Patients were white (97%), male (53.2%), 62 years old (median age, median follow-up of 4.1 years), with right eye involvement (54.4%). At 1, 5, and 10 years, local recurrence was observed in 2.2%, 10%, and 24.6%, enucleation in 0.05%, 11.3%, and 22.1%, metastasis in 1.3%, 6.7%, and 14.2%, and mortality in 1.8%, 14.9%, and 32.8%, respectively. Median visual acuity declined from LogMAR 0.1 to 2.0 at last visit. Radiation retinopathy and optic neuropathy were seen in 54.9% and 46%, respectively, of patients by a median of 742 days (2.03 years) and 1,011.5 days (2.77 years). CONCLUSIONS: Juxtapapillary melanomas demonstrated higher rates of vision loss and local recurrence following plaque brachytherapy compared with other tumor configurations. Enucleation, distant metastasis, and overall mortality were comparable to those reported for non-juxtapapillary melanomas."

      "abstract": "We report the first successful coil embolization using a gadolinium contrast agent (GCA) of 3 pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) in a patient with severe iodine allergy. The patient was a female in her 40s with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The 3 PAVMs had sacs with diameters of up to 20 mm and pulmonary feeding arteries with diameters of up to 5 mm. The PAVMs were located in segment (S) 8 and S9 of the right lung, and S8 of the left lung. Embolization was planned after administration of steroids and antihistamines. However, the procedure was stopped because preoperative pulmonary arteriography using an iodine contrast agent caused pharyngeal itching, coughing, and decreased percutaneous oxygen saturation. Because surgical resection is highly invasive, embolization using a GCA was selected as an alternative treatment strategy. After obtaining approval from our hospital's ethical review board, embolization with a GCA was planned. Embolization was performed in 3 separate sessions. The catheter's position was monitored and adjusted under angiography with manual injection of a GCA and low-dose computed tomography (CT) using an interventional radiology-CT system. The GCA was visible on angiography and coil embolization of the PAVM sacs and feeding arteries was performed. A small amount of GCA was used (7‒9 mL). The patient experienced no allergic reactions during the procedure. Although there are many reports of endovascular treatment using GCA for dialysis shunt stenosis and cerebrovascular disease in patients with iodine allergy, this is the first report describing the use of GCA during PAVM embolization."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose was to investigate i) whether the occurrence of newly diagnosed thyroid cancer is increased after radioactive iodine therapy (RAIT) for Graves' disease (GD), and ii) whether thyroid cancer following RAIT has poor prognosis. METHODS: i) A total of 13,874 eligible patients diagnosed with untreated GD were retrospectively analyzed. The incidence rates of newly developed thyroid cancer by each treatment method for GD was evaluated using the person-year method.ii) Among the 23,179 patients who underwent RAIT for GD, including those with recurrent GD or a history of prior treatment for GD, those who developed thyroid cancer after RAIT were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the risk factors for thyroid cancer. RESULTS: i) A total of 2,273 cases underwent RAIT, 287 underwent surgical treatment, and 11,314 were treated with medication only, and new-onset thyroid cancer was identified in eight patients in the RAIT group and 39 in the medication-only group. A total of 107,218 person-years were observed, but no significant difference was observed in the incidence rate of thyroid cancer with treatment for GD. ii) Of the 23,179 cases underwent RAIT, 17 developed thyroid cancer. Sixteen were diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), of which 15 were microcarcinomas. Logistic regression analysis did not identify any significant risk factors for thyroid cancer development. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the incidence of new thyroid cancer cases did not increase following RAIT for GD. Most thyroid cancers that developed after RAIT were micro-PTCs, with no evidence suggesting a poor prognosis."

      "abstract": "Radioactive iodine ablation is commonly used to treat thyroid diseases. However, despite its efficacy, it has inherent risks and complications. One such complication is iododerma. This rare dermatological condition triggered by iodine exposure has been infrequently documented in association with radioactive iodine therapy for thyroid diseases. Here, we present 2 cases of iododerma following radioactive iodine ablation for thyroid cancer. In the first case, a 38-year-old female developed facial swelling and red blotchy rashes accompanied by papules on the left upper eyelid. Despite initial worsening of symptoms, the patient improved after prednisone treatment. In the second case, a 71-year-old male with metastatic follicular thyroid cancer received iodine-131 therapy after levothyroxine withdrawal for pulmonary metastasis. Approximately 1 week posttherapy, he developed a nontender, nonpruritic rash on the extremities and anterior abdomen, which spontaneously resolved without intervention. Iododerma presents diagnostic challenges because of its rarity and diverse cutaneous manifestations. Although its exact pathophysiology remains unclear, it has been hypothesized to be induced by hypersensitivity reactions to and delayed clearance of iodine from the body. Physicians should be aware of this rare complication of radioactive iodine in patients with thyroid disease."

      "abstract": "Radioactive 131I therapy is a primary treatment for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), with approximately 30% of patients developing iodine-refractory disease. There is an urgent clinical need to improve iodine uptake in PTC. Previous research suggested a connection between triglyceride (TG) accumulation and decreased iodine uptake in benign thyroid cells. Notably, TG accumulation has been found to be a marker of aggressive human PTC. Therefore, it is crucial to elucidate whether TG accumulation affects iodine uptake in PTC, which may lead to a new way for enhancement of iodine uptake. Here, by combining stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy and deuterated Raman tags, we first quantitatively analyzed the level of TG and its source in the K1 cell with low iodine uptake and the TPC-1 cell with high iodine uptake. It was found that K1 cells had significantly greater TG accumulation than TPC-1 cells, primarily due to an increased exogenous uptake of fatty acids. Further RNA-seq transcriptome experiments revealed that the underlying mechanism could be upregulation of lipid biosynthesis, uptake, and transport-related genes, along with down-regulation of fatty acid β-oxidation and lipolysis-related genes in K1 cells. Among the upregulated lipid biosynthesis genes, diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) is of great importance as the rate-limiting enzyme in TG biosynthesis. Notably, the inhibition of DGAT2 led to a significant increase in the expression of iodine uptake-related proteins, namely, sodium iodide symporter (NIS) and thyroglobulin (Tg), in K1 cells. Further Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses unraveled that DGAT2 inhibition could enhance thyroid hormone synthesis, for which iodine is an essential raw material, by alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress and upregulating the pathways related to protein glycosylation and transmembrane transport. In summary, our study has shown that SRS microscopy facilitates the discovery of DGAT2 as a potential target to enhance iodine uptake in PTC, which holds promise for improving treatment outcome of iodine-refractory PTC.",

This interim analysis of a prospective study aims to determine whether 18F-FAPI-74 is superior to 18F-FDG PET/CT in the distinct subgroup of radioactive-iodine (RAI)-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ten patients with recurrent DTC, detected by elevated thyroglobulin, negative RAI-scan after thyroidectomy and RAI-therapy were prospectively included. All patients underwent 18F-FAPI-74 and 18F-FDG PET/CT. The diagnostic performances were compared on a per-patient and per-lesion basis. RESULTS: Fluorine-18-FAPI-74 PET/CT missed tumour recurrence in one patient. Fluorine-18-FDG PET/CT revealed more metastases in three patients. No management change following 18F-FAPI-74 PET/CT was documented. On a per-lesion analysis, the quantitative uptake values were significantly higher for 18F-FDG than 18F-FAPI-74 in all metastases (18F-FDG: median tumor to background ratio-TBRmax: 3.05 (1.02-9.55), 18F-FAPI-74: median TBRmax: 1.09 (0.38-5.09); P<0.001) (18F-FDG: median TBRmean: 1.71 (0.65-11.53), 18F-FAPI-74: median TBRmean: 0.64 (0.24-3.20). The detection rate was significantly higher for 18F-FDG (29/71) compared to 18F-FAPI-74 PET/CT (13/71, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Fluorine-18-FDG-PET/CT outperforms 18F-FAPI-74 PET/CT in RAI-refractory DTC in this prospective analysis.",

We aimed to evaluate if recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) and thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) are equivalent methods of preparation for dosimetry-guided I-131 therapy in metastatic DTC. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 51 adults with metastatic DTC who received I-131 with dosimetry from 2010 through 2022. Gamma camera and blood activity measurements were taken following the pretherapeutic I-131 dose. Statistical analysis compared rhTSH and THW groups; P < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Fifty-one adults undergoing 55 I-131 dosimetry-guided treatments were included: 22 by rhTSH and 33 by THW. The median age was lower (P = .0008), and the proportion of stage IV (P = .009) was higher in rhTSH compared to the THW group. The terminal effective half-life at 24 to 48 hours in the whole body was longer in rhTSH compared to THW group (21.9 vs 17.1 hours; P = .014), but this difference was less significant when limited to the n = 37 metastatic cases (P = .046) and not different for red marrow effective half-life. The calculated allowed I-131 dose was lower in rhTSH compared to THW group (187.5 mCi vs 259.9 mCi; P = .0000). Thyroglobulin was higher during treatment in the rhTSH group (P = .031), whereas its reduction at 3 months was not different after adjusting for age and stage. CONCLUSION: rhTSH is noninferior to THW in preparation for I-131 dosimetry. Compared to THW, rhTSH results in lower calculated allowed I-131 dose after dosimetry, which could translate to fewer side effects or impact on quality of life."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Guidelines vary in their recommendations for postoperative radioactive iodine (RAI) in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Omitting RAI reduces overtreatment but poses the possibility of missing distant metastases. OBJECTIVE: This study compares 4 guidelines on RAI indications and potentially missed metastases. METHODS: DTC patients were included retrospectively, including 48 patients with distant metastases after first RAI cycle, and 469 without distant metastases. The percentage of distant metastases missed was calculated if RAI had been omitted following the 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA), 2019 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), 2022 European Thyroid Association (ETA), and 2022 American Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging/European Association of Nuclear Medicine (SNMMI/EANM) guidelines. RESULTS: In patients without RAI indication, 1.3% to 1.6% of distant metastases may initially be missed with the ATA, ESMO, and ETA guidelines. All these cases had postoperative thyroglobulin (Tg) between 1 and 10 ng/mL or positive Tg antibodies (Tg-abs). In patients for whom RAI should be considered following the ATA, ESMO, and ETA guidelines, 2.6% to 4.0% of distant metastases may initially be missed, with all but 1 case having Tg greater than 10 ng/mL or positive Tg-abs. With the SNMMI/EANM guideline, no distant metastases would be missed, but it resulted in markedly higher RAI use in low-risk patients (82% vs 0%). CONCLUSION: Omitting postoperative RAI in low- and intermediate-risk patients, as recommended by the 2015 ATA, 2019 ESMO, and 2022 ETA guidelines, may lead to a small number of initially undetected distant metastases. However, these metastases could potentially be detected later due to the presence of biochemical disease. In contrast, the broader RAI indications endorsed by SNMMI/EANM reduce the likelihood of missed metastases, but substantially increases RAI use, exposing patients to unnecessary treatment and side effects."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Pre-operative antisepsis of the conjunctiva is indicated prior to intraocular surgery to prevent post-interventional endophthalmitis. In Germany, antisepsis with 5% povidone-iodine (PI) aqueous solution is explicitly required prior to intravitreal injections (IVI), and also generally recommended for intraocular surgery. However, this concentration often leads to a foreign body sensation and an unpleasant burning in combination with dry eye symptoms. Postoperative eye pain, persistent corneal epithelial defects, and a risk of keratitis are further side effects. Due to the repetitive nature of IVI, these symptoms are particularly present in IVI patients. A reduced concentration may be favorable to decrease patient discomfort. A 1.25% PI solution does not increase the iodine concentration in the aqueous humor and is also used for prophylaxis of ophthalmia neonatorum and for preoperative antisepsis; in both cases the renal iodine excretion stays in a physiological range thus thyroid diseases are no contraindication for its use. Thus, the efficacy of reduced concentrations of PI should be evaluated in vitro. METHODS: PI with dilutions below 5% (0.625 - 2.5% serial 1:2 dilution) was tested in vitro in a quantitative suspension assay and in a quantitative carrier test without and with addition of matrices to identify their antimicrobial effect against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Cutibacterium acnes and Candida albicans. RESULTS: No differences in the antimicrobial effect was seen due to reduced concentrations of PI in comparison to a 5% solution. However, a trend was seen regarding the required contact time of the antiseptic solution. CONCLUSION: The in-vitro tests have shown adequate antisepsis of 1.25% PI prior to intraocular surgery. However, it is important to pay attention to a sufficient contact time of the antiseptic of about 1 min before ophthalmologic intervention. In order to give final recommendations, in vivo testing is needed to build a robust data foundation."

      "abstract": "The incidence of thyroid nodules is notably higher in high iodine areas. Currently, there is no study on the relationship between microRNAs and benign thyroid nodules. In this study, accompanied by urinary, blood and water iodine detection, we analyzed microRNA expression profiles through RNA sequencing in patients with benign thyroid nodules and healthy controls from iodine deficiency, adequate and high areas, respectively. Subsequently, specific microRNAs found in high iodine areas and their target genes involved in iodine metabolism were validated using Reverse Transcription-Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that elevated blood iodine levels, upregulated expression of hsa-miR-185-5p, downregulated expression of hsa-miR-21-5p, and enlarged thyroid volume are independent risk factors for thyroid nodules. Furthermore, a strong negative correlation was observed between hsa-miR-185-5p expression and monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) mRNA expression. For diagnosing high iodine-associated thyroid nodules, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) values for MCT8 mRNA exceeded 0.9, and those for hsa-miR-185-5p and hsa-miR-28-3p were approximately 0.8. Furthermore, the combination of MCT8 mRNA alongside hsa-miR-185-5p and hsa-miR-28-3p was identified as the most effective diagnostic indicator, achieving AUC values greater than 0.99. In conclusion, elevated blood iodine levels and hsa-miR-185-5p-MCT8 axis may play critical roles in high iodine-related thyroid nodules. Additionally, the combining MCT8 mRNA with hsa-miR-185-5p and hsa-miR-28-3p could serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosing high iodine-related thyroid nodules. These findings provide a foundation for future biological therapy as well as monitoring strategies study related to high iodine-associated thyroid nodules.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with thyroid cancer (TC) are commonly treated with radioactive iodine therapy (RIA) to prevent neoplastic transformation and the re-emergence of cancer cells. However, it has major side effects on blood cells. However, the degree of change in hematological parameters reported varies across studies. Therefore, the aim of this review was to assesses the mean differences in hematological parameters after RAI therapy. METHODS: The relevant articles for this review were identified through extensive searches of databases and the Google search engine. The identified articles were subsequently selected using predetermined eligibility criteria. All relevant information from the screened articles was extracted. The pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) of the parameters were assessed via a random effects model. The heterogeneity was determined by I2 statistics test. Funnel plots and Egger's test were utilized to assess publication bias. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies including 4,112 and 3,766 study participants before and after RAI therapy, respectively, were included. The pooled SMDs of the total leucocyte count (TLC) (*109/L) at one, three, six and 12 months and the last follow-up period were 2.39, 2.46, 5.84, 3.19, and 0.53, respectively. Changes in the TLC after one, three and six months of therapy were statistically significant. In terms of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC; *109/L) and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC; *109/L), the pooled SMDs at the last follow-up period were 6.32 and 7.37, respectively. In addition, statistically significant changes in the platelet count (PLT; *109/L) were observed at one, three, six and 12 months and at the last follow-up, with pooled SMDs of 7.01, 0.22, 2.63, 6.61, and 8.76, respectively. Furthermore, statistically significant changes in red blood cells (RBCs; *1012/L) and hemoglobin (Hgb; g/dl) were detected after three and six months of therapy, with pooled SMDs of -1.088 and 2.4, respectively. CONCLUSION: According to the current systematic review and meta-analysis, radioiodine therapy had a significant effect on hematological parameters. Thus, early screening and correction of hematological toxicity may be helpful for improving quality of life in thyroid cancer patients receiving radioiodine therapy.

METHODS: This scoping review, following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, analyzed studies from PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL through July 14, 2023. Data on demographics, cancer characteristics, treatment details, and clinical outcomes were extracted. A limited meta-analysis of continuous measures, proportions, and hazard ratios was performed. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included, revealing significant variability across studies. Meta-analysis was limited to overall survival (OS) in intermediate-risk PTC due to methodological heterogeneity across studies. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were inconsistent, RAI activity was often unreported, and complications of RAI were rarely addressed. CONCLUSIONS: Methodological heterogeneity hinders the assessment of adjuvant RAI efficacy between histological variants. Further randomized trials with extended follow-up and improved reporting are needed to better compare the effects of adjuvant RAI in PTC and FTC."

DESIGN: Retrospective, single-center, comparative cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals who received ≥1 intravitreal anti-VEGF injection with use of PI or AqCHX as antisepsis. METHODS: For all patients receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF injections at Austin Retina Associates between March 1, 2015 and November 1, 2023, all injections and cases of suspected PIE were identified with billing codes and confirmed with review of electronic medical record data. Eyes that presented after injection with pain or decreased vision warranting treatment with intravitreal antibiotics were considered suspected PIE cases. Eyes were grouped based on preparation with PI or AqCHX. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were incidence of suspected and culture-positive PIE and visual acuity (VA) at 3 months postendophthalmitis. RESULTS: A total of 302 474 IVIs were administered during the study period. Within the PI group, 59 cases of suspected PIE occurred after 267 190 injections (0.022%; 1 in 4529 injections) compared with 5 cases after 35 284 injections (0.014%; 1 in 7057 injections) in the AqCHX group (P = 0.34). For the PI group, there were 10 culture-positive PIE cases (0.0037%, 1 in 26 719 injections) compared with 0 cases in the AqCHX group (P = 0.25). At 3 months postinfection, average VA in the PI group was 0.97 (∼20/200) and 1.4 (∼20/500) in the AqCHX group (P = 0.41). When controlling for prefilled syringe status, there was no difference in rates of PIE between antisepsis groups (P = 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of endophthalmitis after IVI is low, with no difference in the rates of infection with eyes prepared with topical PI compared with AqCHX. Topical AqCHX has similar efficacy to PI for the prevention of endophthalmitis after IVI.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of clinical and pathological data from 1071 patients who received a total thyroidectomy followed by RAI therapy. The study included 576 of these patients. Participants were separated into two groups according to their reaction to RAI therapy: excellent response (ER) and non-ER (NER). The factors that contribute to NER were found using univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses. The predictive importance of the sTg and sTg/TSH ratio was discovered by analyzing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and setting diagnostic criteria. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to assess the practical implications of these findings. RESULTS: Among the 576 patients assessed, 60.07% (346 individuals) demonstrated an ER to RAI treatment. Independent predictors of a NER identified through both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses included multifocality (odds ratio [OR] = 2.16, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28-3.67, P = 0.004), having more than ten positive lymph nodes (PLN) (OR = 3.78, 95% CI: 1.68-8.54, P = 0.001), presence of distant metastases (OR = 19.22, 95% CI: 2.09-176.93, P = 0.009), elevated stimulated thyroglobulin (sTg) levels (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.00-1.07, P = 0.025), and a higher sTg/TSH ratio (OR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.80-3.41, P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis established diagnostic thresholds for predicting NER at an sTg level of 7.255 ng/ml (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.893) and an sTg/TSH ratio of 0.127 (AUC = 0.889), both demonstrating robust sensitivity and specificity. Smooth curve fitting illustrated a progressive increase in the risk of NER with rising levels of the sTg/TSH ratio. DCA confirmed the substantial clinical net benefit of these predictors in forecasting NER outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The sTg/TSH ratio is confirmed as a reliable diagnostic marker for predicting the response to primary RAI treatment in PTC. Moreover, active postoperative follow-up and surveillance are essential for patients with multifocality, PLN >10, sTg >7.255 ng/ml, and sTg/TSH ratio >0.127.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The majority of thyroid cancer patients have a good prognosis. Even in advanced disease, the radioactive iodine (RAI) response improves the prognosis. However, RAI refractoriness poses a significant challenge for these patients. The objective of the study was to assess the expression of SCL5A5 as a potential marker for predicting future resistance to radioiodine treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radioactive iodine-refractory papillary thyroid carcinoma (RAIR-PTC) and iodine-sensitive papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) were included in the study. Demographic and clinicopathological data were retrospectively analyzed. RNA samples were converted to cDNA. Gene expression reactions were performed using synthesized solute carrier family 5 member 5 (SLC5A5) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH) primer samples. RESULTS: Of the patients, 51 (61.4%) had iodine-sensitive PTC and 32 (38.5%) were RAIR-PTC. Patients were followed up for 8 ± 6.4 years. The mean age at diagnosis was higher in the RAIR-PTC group (56.56 ± 15.22 years vs. 46.82 ± 12.43 years, p = 0.002). The PTC group had higher SLC5A5 gene expression than RAIR-PTC. In addition, no statistically significant correlation was observed between basal thyroglobulin levels and tumor standardized uptake value-maximum (SUV-max) on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (p = 0.304). CONCLUSION: SLC5A5 gene expression is reduced in radioactive iodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma. Furthermore, the decreased expression status of the SLC5A5 gene before preablative iodine treatment may serve as a predictive indicator of future resistance to RAI therapy."

      "abstract": "Water pollution, driven by rapid industrialization, has become a global issue, threatening human health and ecosystems. The contamination of water sources with radioactive waste, heavy metals, and toxic oxoanions has led to a scarcity of clean drinking water. Ionic porous organic polymers (iPOPs) offer a superior way for water purification due to their multiple binding sites and ion-exchange properties, which enable them to remove contaminants through electrostatic interactions efficiently. Moreover, iPOPs can be regenerated through simple desorption processes and reused over multiple cycles, making them cost-effective. Herein, we have synthesized chemically and thermally robust iPOPs (TPE-C1 and TPE-C4) using a one-step nucleophilic substitution reaction and utilized them for the removal of radioactive waste (iodine in vapor, aqueous, and organic phases) along with various hazardous oxoanions (Cr2O72-, MnO4-, and ReO4-) from water via an ion-exchange process with high uptake capacities. To the best of our knowledge, the adsorption capacity of TPE-C1 for I3- (4.3 g/g) is the highest in the field of iPOPs. Both the iPOPs showed ultrafast kinetics (>90% removal within 50-150 s), with a kinetic constant value as high as 0.14 mg g-1 min-1 (for permanganate ion), which enhances their efficiency and applicability. In the presence of a large excess (100 times) of competitive anions, the efficiency of TPE-C1 remained mostly unaffected, demonstrating its excellent selectivity. Further, density functional theory (DFT) studies confirmed the presence of electrostatic interactions between the iPOPs and the oxoanions, as well as determined the binding sites and binding energy for the iPOPs toward the pollutants. These iPOPs were recyclable for up to five cycles with no loss in efficiency and maintained consistent performance across various water sources (sea, river, and lake), reflecting their practical applicability. For real-time use, a column-based setup was prepared using TPE-C1, which could achieve >98% removal of these toxic pollutants. With high adsorption capacity, superfast kinetics, superior selectivity, and facile recyclability, these iPOPs offer an affordable and effective solution for removing a wide variety of pollutants and advancing water treatment technologies."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RAIR-DTC) has become a challenge in clinical practice, particularly in China with a high incidence and undesirable survival outcome. Since the publication of first China consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of RAIR-DTC in 2019, significant and rapid advances have occurred in the field both in China and internationally. This guideline aims to inform Chinese clinicians, researchers, patients, and health policy makers on the latest evidence and recommendations, to further standardize the clinical diagnosis and treatment of RAIR-DTC. METHODS: The structured clinical questions addressed in this guideline were derived from clinical diagnostic and treatment processes, with references to study, prior guidelines, expert consensus, and systematic reviews, etc. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used for quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the evidence. The editorial process was completely independent of the guideline development group. RESULTS: The guideline addressed 26 clinical questions and formed 35 recommendations. In this guideline, the definition criteria for RAIR-DTC was optimized, prediction and identification was based on evidence including molecular testing, dynamic biochemical changes, and multimodal imaging. Comprehensive pre-treatment clinical evaluation was emphasized and tailored for individualized decision-making. The combination of systematic therapy and surgery, and the redifferentiation followed by RAI therapy were also reviewed and updated. Molecular imaging plays a unique role in the pre-assessing and therapeutic response evaluation for RAIR-DTC. CONCLUSIONS: We have updated and developed evidence-based recommendations with the aim of providing scientific, rigorous, and comprehensive guidance for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of RAIR-DTC patients in China. We hope to share our guideline with colleagues out of China, with the expectation of further comments and suggestions."

To determine the mechanism of this novel absorbent, batch experiments related to the temperature, pH, competitive ion (Cl-), and kinetic analysis were carried out. The results showed that the Ag2O-Mg(OH)2 plate composites had high adsorption capacity and efficiency for I- (409 mg/g, 25 °C) with a wide range of pH values (3-9). In addition, the adsorption time from the initial concentration to I- removal (97.36%) was only 20 min. Competitive ion experiments depicted that Cl- influenced the capacity of adsorbing I-. The k value of the pseudo-second-order model and regression factor R 2 were 7.86 × 10-3g mg-1 min-1 and 0.999 at 25 °C, respectively. The kinetics and XPS results proved that the mechanism of adsorption was chemical adsorption. Compared with other commercial adsorbents, the Ag2O-Mg(OH)2 plate composites had potential for application in nuclear wastewater treatment with low cost and high efficiency."

An additional aim included assessing features and functionalities desirable in the development of a web-based intervention to engage patients in their self-management and thyroid cancer survivorship care. METHODS: Following the Social Cognitive Theory framework and person-based principles, we conducted six focus groups with 22 patients diagnosed with DTC who completed RAI treatment and individual interviews with 12 stakeholders in DTC care. The interviews focused on participants' perspectives on current self-management strategies and mockups of a symptom management web-based intervention. Before focus groups and interviews, participants completed a demographics survey. Focus group discussions and interviews were transcribed and coded using content analysis. Interrater reliability was satisfactory (ɑ=.88). RESULTS: A total of 34 individuals (patients and stakeholders) participated in the study; the mean age was 45 (SD 13.4) and 45.3 (SD 13) years, respectively. Three domains emerged from qualitative interviews: (1) difficult-to-manage RAI symptoms: short, medium, and late treatment effects; (2) key intervention structure and content feedback on mockups; and (3) intervention content to promote RAI symptom management and survivorship care. Focus group participants identified the most prevalent RAI symptoms that were difficult to manage as: dry mouth (11/22, 50%), salivary gland swelling (8/22, 36%), and changes in taste (12/22, 55%). Feedback elicited from both groups found education and symptom management mockup videos to be helpful in patient self-management of RAI symptoms, whereas patients and stakeholders provided mixed feedback on the benefits of a draft frequently asked questions page. Across focus groups and stakeholder interviews, nutrition-based symptom management strategies, communication with family members, and practical survivorship follow-up information emerged as helpful content to include in a future web-based supportive care intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest education and symptom management videos can empower patients with DTC to self-manage mild to moderate RAI symptoms on a web-based platform. Findings emphasized the need for additional information for patients related to ongoing care following RAI treatment including social support and thyroid cancer surveillance. The findings provide insights for theoretically informed interventions and recommendations for refinements in thyroid cancer survivorship from patient and provider perspectives.",

In this study, a novel formulation of Polyvinyl alcohol-collagen microspheres (PCMs) with an optimal settling rate is developed. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses confirm that the PCMs have uniform morphology with diameters ranging from 20 to 30 μm. These microspheres are successfully labeled with 131I, exhibiting good in vitro stability. Subsequently, 131I-labeled PCMs are administered via the hepatic artery into rats with orthotopic HCC, leading to a significant increase in median overall survival (p < 0.05). Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging and immunohistochemical assessments demonstrate precise biodistribution and stable retention of 131I-PCMs in the liver for up to 14 days. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) further reveals the inhibition of tumor growth following 131I-PCM treatment. In summary, the 131I-PCMs display high radiolabeling efficiency, stability, and a promising radioembolization effect in the orthotopic HCC rodent model, highlighting their potential for use in interventional cancer therapy.",

In aquaculture, antibiotics and disinfectants are frequently used to manipulate the host gut microbiota, but the combined effects on asymptomatic fish remain unclear. We investigated the effects of single and combined treatments with antibiotics and disinfectants on grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) gut health, immune response, microbiome dynamics and transcriptome profile. In a 2-week trial, grass carp were exposed to enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg) in the basal diet or povidone-iodine (0.05 mg/L) in fresh water. A 14-day treatment led to significant oxidative stress, as indicated by reduced catalase and total superoxide dismutase activities. Digestive enzyme activities, including amylase and lipase, were also significantly suppressed. Gut microbiota diversity decreased, with notable shifts in dominant bacterial phyla, including reduced abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and increased Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria. Transcriptomic analysis revealed downregulation of immune-related pathways, including those linked to IgA production, and suppression of key immune-related genes, such as major histocompatibility complex 2 (MHC2) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Histopathological analysis showed damaged intestinal villi, increased goblet cell numbers and significant apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells, as confirmed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) staining and upregulation of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9. These findings demonstrate that enrofloxacin and povidone-iodine disrupt gut microbiota balance, impair mucosal immunity and induce apoptosis in grass carp."

      "abstract": "For patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), that is, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC), the American Thyroid Association and European Thyroid Association generally recommend radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy after surgery only for high-risk patients. For intermediate-risk patients, RAI therapy is recommended only as a should-be-considered option. For low-risk patients, RAI therapy is not routinely recommended. Other countries, such as Germany, are more in favor of using RAI. Thus, RAI therapy remains a matter of controversial debate, because prospective long-term data on survival are scarce. Methods: We retrospectively compared long-term relative survival in DTC cohorts treated with and without RAI. From the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database, 101,087 patients harboring DTC were identified between 2000 and 2020. Patient cohorts were subdivided based on histology (classical PTC, aggressive variants of PTC, FTC, and minimally invasive FTC). These cohorts were stratified into the following categories: very low risk, low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk. Relative survival was determined for each subgroup. Statistics included a z-test specifically developed for comparison of relative survival, testing the long-term effect of RAI therapy (3, 5, and 10 y). Results: The relative survival rate is higher or tends to be higher in most subgroups undergoing RAI therapy than in subgroups not undergoing RAI therapy. Even for low-risk minimally invasive FTC, the 10-y relative survival rate tends to be higher by 2.0% (P = 0.055). For larger tumor size or lymph node involvement in classical PTC, a 10-y relative survival benefit of 1.3%-2.0% (P = 0.045) in the RAI subgroup prevails. In high-risk DTC, benefits in relative survival of up to 30.9% (P < 0.05) were observed. Relative survival is not negatively affected in any RAI subgroup. Conclusion: In patients with DTC, depending on histology subtype, a benefit in relative survival prevails in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk subgroups that underwent RAI therapy compared with patients who did not undergo RAI therapy. Even in low-risk minimally invasive FTC, a clear trend toward higher survival rates is observed. For PTC, a survival benefit prevails in the presence of lymph node involvement, larger tumor size, or distant metastasis."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether multiphase hepatic CT can predict liver function measured with indocyanine-green-retention test (ICG-R15) and identify patients with severe liver dysfunction contraindicating major hepatectomy, defined as ICG-R15 ≥ 20%, compared to technetium-99m-galactosyl serum albumin (99mTc-GSA) scintigraphy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 118 patients (84 men, mean age, 69.4 ± 11.3 years) who underwent ICG-R15, 99mTc-GSA, and multi-phase CT including early portal-venous-phase and 3-min delayed-phase. CT-derived extracellular volume fraction (ECV), iodine washout rate (IWR), liver and spleen volumes normalized by body-surface-area (LV/BSA and SpV/BSA, respectively), and 99mTc-GSA-derived blood clearance index (HH15) and liver receptor index (LHL15) were quantified. Each parameter was compared between ICG-R15 ≥ 20% (n = 22) and ICG-R15 < 20% (n = 96) groups. Correlations with ICG-R15 were analyzed. The diagnostic performance to predict ICG-R15 ≥ 20% was assessed with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent CT predictors, and combined performance was determined. RESULTS: In the ICG-R15 ≥ 20% group, IWR (p < 0.001), LV/BSA (p = 0.026), LHL15 (p < 0.001) were lower and ECV (p = 0.001), SpV/BSA (p = 0.005), and HH15 (p < 0.001) were higher compared to ICG-R15 < 20% group. ICG-R15 showed positive correlations with ECV (r = 0.355), SpV/BSA (r = 0.248), and HH15 (r = 0.385), while negative correlations with IWR (r = -0.523), LV/BSA (r = -0.123, not statistically significant), and LHL15 (r = -0.504). The AUC of ECV, IWR, LV/BSA, SpV/BSA, HH15, and LHL15 were 0.719, 0.845, 0.653, 0.694, 0.844, and 0.878, respectively. IWR, SpV/BSA, and LV/BSA were independent predictors, with a combined AUC of 0.924. CONCLUSION: IWR predicted liver function better than ECV and hepatosplenic volumetry. The combined IWR and volumetry yielded an accurate prediction of severe liver dysfunction. KEY POINTS: Question Despite the widespread use of multiphase CT in patients with hepatobiliary diseases, its potential role in assessing liver function has been scarcely evaluated. Findings Iodine washout rate (IWR), liver volume indexed by body surface area, and spleen volume indexed by body surface area were independent predictors for severe liver dysfunction. Clinical relevance Combined IWR and hepatosplenic volumetry on routine hepatic CT may help assess hepatic function for optimizing treatment strategies and predicting patient prognosis."

In recent years, crystallized porous materials have been extensively investigated to achieve highly effective adsorption of radioactive iodine. Herein, by using the hydrothermal method, a Ni cluster-based framework (1) was successfully constructed through a self-assembly process. Driven by the π-π stacking interactions between π-electron-rich benzimidazole groups, [Ni5S6] clusters stack in a lattice, forming a porous framework with proper channels, rendering compound 1 as an ideal adsorbent for iodine. Compound 1 delivered a capability of iodine adsorption (2.08 g g-1 and 560 mg g-1 for gaseous and solution iodine, respectively) with stable cyclability."

While multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) offer effective treatments for RAIR-DTC, most patients remain noncurative and eventually experience disease progression. In addition, long-term use of these medications is hindered by adverse events, drug resistance and high cost. Recently, the use of MKIs and TKIs has reignited interest in enhancing RAI incorporation. This approach aims to restore the effectiveness of RAI therapy in patients with RAIR-DTC by using agents that increase RAI uptake, potentially overcoming current treatment challenges. This review covers the molecular mechanisms behind RAI resistance, the definition of RAIR-DTC and the efforts to enhance RAI incorporation through various agents, including those currently undergoing clinical trials.",

This region is known for its mineral resources, including a gold ore mine in Hatti (Raichur District), an iron ore mine in Toranagallu (Bellary District), and uranium deposits in Gogi (Yadgir District). However, the soil in this area is deficient in iodine, leading to iodine deficiency disorders such as goiter and hypothyroidism. More than 80,000 cases of these disorders have been reported in the region, along with a few cases of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease. The younger age group is predominantly affected, with a higher prevalence in females compared to males. As a result, hypothyroidism contributes to pregnancy-related complications and obesity in women. Early detection is possible due to the visible swelling in the neck, prompting patients to seek medical attention. Timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment can reduce goiter size, restore the body to a euthyroid state, and alleviate symptoms."

However, iodine is highly sensitive to environmental factors and exists in various chemical species, which complicates the recovery of trace iodine in aqueous systems. Here a porous aromatic framework (iPAF-TEPT) is presented with multifunctional adsorption sites for efficient recovery of various iodine species, including molecular iodine (I2), iodide (I- and I3 -). The material utilizes a synergistic strategy combining charge-transfer interactions and Coulomb interactions to effectively adsorb different iodine species. Thanks to its high density of accessible ion exchange sites for I⁻ and I3⁻, and nitrogen-rich sites for I2, iPAF-TEPT demonstrates an unprecedented adsorption capacity for various iodine forms. Notably, iPAF-TEPT achieves exceptional removal efficiency for trace iodine pollutants, even at concentrations as low as 100 ppb, making it the first promising single-framework material for highly efficient treatment of aqueous iodine contamination."

A 45-year-old man with secondary infertility was diagnosed with mild asthenospermia before undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). A repeat sperm analysis (SA) on June 30, 2022, after three months of using compound PVP-I liniment to treat fungal infection under a fingernail and toenail, revealed severe oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. After 77 days of drug withdrawal, sperm concentration, and normal morphology gradually returned to normal, but motility was only partially restored. It seems that the usage of PVP-I has a side effect of causing a decline in sperm quality. Although the exact mechanism of this adverse effect of PVP-I is unclear, men who are in fertility treatment should be informed of the potential risks.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma is a distinct subtype of papillary thyroid carcinoma that can occasionally present with aggressive features, including distant metastases and extrathyroidal extension. While radioactive iodine ablation is a well-established treatment for residual disease, its post-treatment effects on tracheal and paratracheal structures remain poorly characterized. CASE PRESENTATION: A 22-year-old male individual of Taiwanese descent presented with an enlarged neck mass and was diagnosed with follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma. He underwent thyroidectomy, modified radical neck dissection, and postoperative radioactive iodine-131 ablation (100 mCi). A total of 1 year later, a chest computed tomography revealed a paratracheal soft tissue nodule and tracheal nodularity. Bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided sampling identified multiple 2-3 mm submucosal tracheal nodules containing white exudate. Cytopathologic analysis of both the paratracheal soft tissue nodule and the tracheal wall nodules revealed mucinous material without evidence of malignancy or inflammation. Microbiologic studies were negative for infection. CONCLUSION: These atypical bronchoscopic and pathologic findings likely represent post-radioactive iodine treatment changes. The patient remained without evidence of disease for 22 months, ongoing on thyroid suppression levels of thyroxine hormone replacement. The case represents successful radioactive iodine treatment of papillary thyroid carcinoma residual disease after surgical resection, with the first described pathologic findings to correlate with these post-treatment changes.",

For this purpose, the spinach plant was cultivated in an open field (Dehdasht, Iran), biofortified with potassium iodide (KI) and sodium selenate (Na₂SeO₄) at different concentrations (Se 1 mg/L-I 1 mg/l; Se1-I1, Se2.5-I1, Se5-I1, Se1-I5, Se2.5-I5, and Se5-I5) through spraying the leaves twice during the growth season. Results indicated that while iodine did not have any effect on plant yield, selenium fortification at 2.5 mg/L significantly increased production (60.05 t/ha). However, both elements were successfully accumulated in the leaves of the plant. Therefore, the highest accumulation for both elements was noted by Se5-I5 sample. Meanwhile, the joint biofortification of spinach improved the activity of antioxidant enzymes, macro/microelements content, photosynthetic pigments, nitrate reductase activity, ascorbic acid, total phenol content, carotenoid compounds, total soluble solids, and dry matter percentage, while decreasing the nitrate and malondialdehyde contents in the leaves, resulting in a plant with improved dietary properties and yield production. In this regard, treatment Se2.5-I5 was the best treatment in relation to various tests conducted.",

We aimed to evaluate whether the novel thrombus perviousness measured with DECT is associated with improved recanalisation and better functional outcomes in acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) patients with endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). METHODS: 108 AIS patients with middle cerebral artery occlusion who underwent DECT angiography on admission and received EVT treatment between April 2020 and September 2023 were retrospectively analysed. Thrombus attenuation increase (TAI) was evaluated on routine CT angiography and non-contrast CT, and DECT quantitative parameters of thrombus, including iodine concentration (IC) and normalised IC (NIC) were measured. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association of thrombus characteristics with arterial occlusive lesion scale and 90-day modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS: NIC was significantly associated with successful recanalisation (OR 1.372 (95% CI 1.194 to 1.625); p<0.001) and good functional outcome (OR 1.252 (95% CI 1.114 to 1.446); p<0.001). NIC yielded higher performance, with area under curve (AUC) of 0.789 and 0.740, in the prediction of recanalisation and functional outcome than TAI (AUCs=0.635 and 0.592). Compared with low-level NIC thrombus, high-level NIC was associated with 11.4 and 15.4 times higher likelihood of successful recanalisation and good functional outcome. Moreover, NIC was a significant indicator to differentiate large artery atherosclerosis from cardioembolism stroke with high specificity and positive predictive value. CONCLUSIONS: Higher DECT-derived NIC is associated with increased odds of successful recanalisation and good functional outcome for EVT patients, and it yielded higher prediction performance than TAI."

METHODS: The patients who had hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease, with severe liver injury (The level of total bilirubin ≥12 mg/dL), and after 1 week of liver protective medication treatment, the patient's liver function did not improve, were enrolled in this study. All patients were treated with iodine-131 and PE. The patients' laboratory data after 3 months of isotope therapy were collected. RESULTS: In this study, there were 8 patients included, the average model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores were greater than 20 (ranges from 19 to 30) at baseline. The levels of hemoglobin, platelet count, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, glutamyl transpeptidase, MELD scores, free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, antithyroid peroxidase autoantibody and serum thyrotropin receptor antibodies after PE treatment were significantly lower than before PE treatment (P < .05). The level of total bilirubin at 3 months post-131I treatment was significantly lower than pre-131I treatment (P = .0200), the same was the level of direct bilirubin (P = .0200). CONCLUSION: Our study enrolled Graves' hyperthyroidism patients with severe liver injury whose average MELD scores were greater than 20, and shows that liver function test can recover on about 3 months treated iodine-131 combined with PE therapy."

It is currently a treatment option for mild Graves' disease, but there have been no data suggesting the validity of continuing low-dose iodine treatment after improvement in thyrotoxicosis. For this prospective observational study, we recruited patients with Graves' disease treated only with low-dose iodine (potassium iodine ≤25 mg/day). These patients were then divided into two groups: those who continued with low-dose iodine (C group) and those who discontinued it (DC) group. We compared the 2-year thyrotoxicosis relapse rate between the two groups and investigated anthropometric variables associated with relapse. Of 2,159 patients on iodine treatment, 56 patients met the selection criteria but 4 who gave consent dropped out, leaving 25 in the C group and 27 in the DC group. Regarding baseline characteristics, the C group had a longer duration of Graves' disease, lower therapeutic iodine doses, and lower TSH levels than the DC group. During the 2-year follow-up period, the relapse rate in the C and DC groups was 32.0% and 22.2%, respectively (p = 0.536). Furthermore, patients who relapsed had significantly higher therapeutic iodine doses, FT4 levels, and TSAb levels at baseline than patients who did not relapse. Multiple logistic regression showed that relapse is positively associated with therapeutic iodine dose and TSAb levels. The present study failed to show the efficacy of continuing low-dose iodine in patients with Graves' disease after improvement in thyrotoxicosis. The relapse rate seems to be affected by residual immune activity. UMIN000047660."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are associated with morbidity, mortality, and increased costs. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of SSIs and approximately 30% of hemodialysis patients carry this organism in their nares. Unlike mupirocin, intranasal povidone-iodine (PVI) is applied only the day of surgery to prevent surgical site infections. Thus, intranasal PVI could be valuable in orthopedic trauma surgery settings where time to prepare a patient for surgery is limited. METHODS: We conducted a small phase IV post-marketing study from 2020 to 2021 in an academically affiliated hospital wherein staff administered intranasal PVI pre- and post-operatively to consenting patients undergoing orthopedic fixation procedures for traumatic fractures. Before implementing the PVI intervention, we conducted a human factors task analysis to determine the optimal time and hospital location to perform PVI decolonization for patients receiving these orthopedic fixation procedures. After the post-marketing study was completed, we conducted qualitative interviews with healthcare staff to determine barriers and facilitators that could affect staff members' likelihood of administering PVI to patients. We aligned our inductive interview findings with strategies defined in Powell and colleagues' Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) framework to facilitate generalizability and standardized reporting of implementation strategies. RESULTS: Our human factors task analysis identified the Day of Surgery Admissions (DOSA) as the appropriate context for PVI administration within surgical workflow, as there was downtime during this period and direct patient-provider communication could occur. Two DOSA nurses, one postoperative nurse, and one orthopedic trauma surgeon agreed to be interviewed. Facilitators of intranasal PVI administration included emphasizing the non-invasiveness of PVI nasal swabs to patients and emphasizing intranasal PVI efficacy to staff and patients. While the nurse participants felt that having PVI orders with other medication orders in the EMR helped them identify patients enrolled in the study and who required PVI, entering these orders increased the surgeon's workflow and presented a time barrier. CONCLUSIONS: Macro- and micro-level contextual factors should be considered when tailoring implementation to healthcare settings. Our findings reinforce prior work demonstrating the value of incorporating human factors engineering methodologies into infection control and prevention implementation approaches.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Compared with those of sporadic differentiated thyroid cancer (SDTC), the tumor characteristics of familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC) remain debatable. In addition, there is a paucity of data suggesting that their response to radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy differs from that of SDTC. We aimed to determine whether FNMTC is a homogenous biological entity that differs from SDTC in RAI therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent adjuvant ablative iodine radiotherapy between July 2016 and March 2020. We compared the differences in clinicopathological features and prognoses between the FNMTC and SDTC groups. The endpoint of the study was the rate of therapeutic response after 1 and 3 years of follow-up after first-line treatment. The response to therapy was classified into four categories: excellent response (ER), biochemical incomplete response (BIR), structural incomplete response (SIR) and indeterminate response (IDR). In addition, we conducted a meta-analysis of cohort studies to investigate the clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Of all the patients (n = 1758), 109 (6.2%) were classified as having FNMTC, whereas the remaining 1649 (93.8%) had SDTC. A greater proportion of FNMTC patients presented with extrathyroidal extension, capsular invasion, and multifocality (P = 0.01). In addition, patients with FNMTC were more likely to have advanced primary tumor stage and lymph node metastasis, but the differences were not statistically significant. At the end of follow-up (median follow-up of 3 years), the response to RAI therapy was significantly different between the two groups (ER: 66.1% vs 74.3%; IDR: 9.2% vs 12.1%; SIR: 14.7% vs 7.1%; BIR: 10.1% vs 6.5%). Moreover, patients with FNMTC more frequently presented evidence of disease than patients with SDTC did. However, the disease-free survival of patients with FNMTC was not shorter than that of patients with SDTC (P ≥ 0.05). CONCLUSION: Patients with FNMTC more often have aggressive characteristics at presentation and relatively worse clinical outcomes after RAI therapy. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the recurrence rate in the short-term follow-up. Considering that, FNMTC patients may be required more aggressive treatment approaches and closer postoperative monitoring."

METHODS: High-risk patients with LPC at T stage ≥ 3a, Gleason score ≥ 8, and initial prostate-specific antigen ≥ 20.0 ng/mL treated between 2010 and 2021 were retrospectively evaluated. All the patients were treated with IMRT plus ADT or trimodality therapy. In both groups, ADT was initiated 6 months before and continued for 2 years after radiotherapy. Survival and acute and late radiation-induced AEs were evaluated and compared. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-eight patients were treated with IMRT, and 91 underwent trimodality. Five- and 7-year biochemical-clinical failure-free survival (BCFFS) rates in the IMRT/trimodality group were 94.9/96.2, and 91.8/91.5%, respectively (P = 0.511). Stratified by 1-2/3 factors, 5- and 7-year BCFFS rates in the IMRT groups were 95.8/91.8, and 95.8/75.6%, respectively (P = 0.009). Five and 7-year BCFFS rates in the trimodality group were 96.8/94.1, and 91.4/94.1%, respectively (P = 0.995). The cumulative 3-/5-year incidence of late genitourinary AEs in the IMRT/trimodality group was 7.3/8.4, and 15.5/16.9%, respectively (P = 0.037), and the cumulative 3-/5-year incidence of late gastrointestinal AEs was 2.2/3.4, and 11.0/12.2%, respectively (P = 0.001). Thirty patients (9.1%) could not complete long-term ADT. CONCLUSION: Treatment results of both IMRT and trimodality were considered to be good, and our results also indicated that the long-term survival of unfavorable high-risk patients with LPC who had three risk factors was poor in the IMRT group. Further treatment experience of both modalities must be accumulated with more appropriate patient allocations."

This prospective randomized controlled trial employed a single-blind design. Overall, 112 patients were randomized to four groups based on the antiseptic assigned for the intervention: control, chlorhexidine (CHX), povidone-iodine (PI), and hydrogen peroxide (HP). The patients were followed up on days 1, 3, 7, and 15 after surgery, and pain and swelling were assessed. Data were analysed using ANOVA and post hoc multiple comparison tests. The CHX and HP groups demonstrated significantly lower mean pain scores compared to the control group on days 3 (P = 0.021, P = 0.033) and 7 (P = 0.002, P = 0.017). Regarding the difference in swelling from baseline (before surgery) on each follow-up day, the CHX and HP groups showed significantly less swelling compared to the control group on days 1 (P = 0.023, P = 0.012), 3 (P = 0.007, P = 0.001), and 7 (P = 0.002, P = 0.018). Moreover, the CHX and HP groups demonstrated significantly lower mean swelling changes from baseline compared to PI: CHX vs PI on day 7 (P = 0.032), HP vs PI on day 1 (P = 0.037). In conclusion, chlorhexidine and hydrogen peroxide solutions are highly beneficial options for socket irrigation following mandibular third molar surgery. This study showed a more prominent reduction in pain and swelling with chlorhexidine and hydrogen peroxide solutions compared to povidone-iodine solution."

The aim of our study was analyzing the functional outcome after brachytherapy with bi-nuclide plaques (BBNP), maintaining prognostic factors for legal blindness (LB). METHODS: We have analyzed all consecutive patients with large uveal melanoma treated with BBNP at our institution between 01/1999 and 12/2020. The post-treatment follow-up data were screened up to 06/2023. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify predictive factors for development of LB following BBNP. RESULTS: Overall, 570 patients with median age of 65.6 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 54.5-74.0) underwent BBNP. During the median post-treatment follow-up of 30.8 months (IQR: 12.9-57.3), LB was diagnosed in 287 (50.4%) patients. Patients' age (> 67 years, adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.58, 95%-confidence interval [CI] = 1.24-2.00, p < 0.0001), tumor thickness (> 8.5 mm, aHR = 1.43, 95%-CI = 1.12-1.82, p = 0.004), VA (> 0.5 LogMAR, aHR = 1.59, 95%-CI = 1.25-2.02, p < 0.0001), and ciliary body involvement (aHR = 0.77, 95%-CI = 0.60-0.97, p = 0.029) were confirmed as independent predictors of LB in the final multivariable Cox regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately a half of patients with large uveal melanoma develop LB around 2.5 years after brachytherapy. Further optimization of treatment strategies, including both therapeutic and preventive measures, has the potential to enhance the functional outcome after episcleral plaque therapy for large UMs.",

METHODS: (1) 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) analysis revealed the inhibitory effects of Caerin 1.1 and TFMP-Y4 on Hepg2 and LO2 cell growth. (2) The chloramine-T method was used to prepare 131I-Caerin 1.1 and 131I-TFMP-Y4. (3) Uptake and elution assays revealed that Hepg2 cells bound and retained 131I-Caerin 1.1 and 131I-TFMP-Y4, and the inhibitory effects on Hepg2 cells were verified with cellular proliferation/toxicity assays. (4) A hormonal nude mouse model was established to study the in vivo therapeutic effects of the peptides alone, 131I-Caerin 1.1 and 131I-TFMP-Y4. RESULTS: (1) Caerin 1.1 inhibited Hepg2 and LO2 cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, and the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were 9.34 µg/mL and 22.16 µg/mL, respectively. Moreover, TFMP-Y4 did not inhibit these two cell lines. (2) The labeling rates of 131I-Caerin 1.1 and 131I-TFMP-Y4 were high and stable. Both could significantly reduce the activity of Hepg2 cells and inhibit tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: 131I-Caerin 1.1 and 131I-TFMP-Y4 significantly inhibited the proliferation of Hepg2 cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, 131I-TFMP-Y4 can reduce adverse reactions during treatment.",

      "abstract": "Permanent radioactive iodine-125 seed implantation (RISI), known as radioactive seed implantation, is a minimally invasive internal radiation technique. This method involves implanting 125I seeds (4.5 × 0.8 mm, encapsulated in a nickel-titanium alloy) into tumors under image guidance. The radionuclide continuously releases low energy γ-rays, effectively killing tumor cells. RISI delivers high local doses with minimal damage to surrounding normal tissues. It is performed through image-guided percutaneous puncture, accompanied by high precision, minimal trauma, and rapid recovery. In Western countries, RISI is primarily utilized for early-stage prostate cancer. In 2002, Professor Junjie Wang introduced computed tomography (CT)-guided technology for RISI, expanding its indications to head and neck, thoracic, abdominal, pelvic, and spinal tumors. In 2014, he proposed the concept of image-guided interventional brachytherapy, advancing minimally invasive brachytherapy. In 2015, he integrated three-dimensional 3D-printing template (3D-PT) with CT-guided technology, significantly enhancing the precision, quality, and efficiency of RISI, and introduced the concept of stereotactic brachytherapy. Over nearly 20 years, RISI has developed into a standardized procedure, involving preoperative planning, intraoperative optimization, and postoperative verification, highlighting its role in comprehensive cancer treatment. The main treatments for soft tissue sarcoma (STS) include surgery or surgery combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, STS is prone to local recurrence, and effective treatments are lacking after recurrence. Experts have conducted extensive trials on RISI for the treatment of recurrent STS (r-STS), accumulating significant clinical experience. This study aimed to establish standards and consensus on 3D-PT-assisted CT-guided RISI for the treatment of r-STS.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This unmatched case-control study was conducted on 40 female patients (20 cancer free controls and 20 patients treated with 131I therapy). Data were collected via clinical examination, self reported questionnaire including the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14), salivary tests, socio-demographic and behavioural characteristics. Data were analyzed using descriptive, bivariate and multivariate statistics. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the total number of decayed, missing and filled surfaces, stimulated and unstimulated salivary flow rates, and periodontal indices between the study and control groups in the unadjusted analysis. Age adjusted analysis revealed significant differences in the stimulated and unstimulated salivary flow rates, periodontal indices, physical pain domain scores between groups. No significant differences were observed between groups in the xerostomia severity and OHRQoL. In study group, the score for the OHIP-14 psychological discomfort domain was negatively correlated with both stimulated and unstimulated salivary flow rates. The total OHIP-14 score and its domain scores of physical pain and psychological disability were correlated positively with the severity of xerostomia, but negatively correlated with number of the repeated 131I therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Due to xerostomia, patients reported worse OHRQoL in the domains of physical pain, psychological discomfort and disability. They had worse periodontal status and tooth brushing habits than healthy controls. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The findings of this study may provide a valuable insight on the oral health problems and needs of target group when planning a a team-based care.",

However, its clinical utility is often hampered by its unsatisfactory stability, uncontrolled release of active iodine and toxicity in moist environments. In this study, we report a novel iodine-containing hydrogel (I2@Nap-FFGP) designed for sustained iodine delivery under humid physiological and pathological conditions. I2@Nap-FFGP was fabricated using a self-assembling peptide-based hydrogel containing a proline motif to form a stable iodine complex. The resulting hydrogel exhibited excellent biocompatibility and robust antibacterial effect, it significantly inhibited bacteria-associated endometrial infections in mice and effectively alleviated inflammation. Moreover, the hydrogel successfully restored endometrial architecture and function. Notably, I2@Nap-FFGP remarkably improved pregnancy rates in mice with endometritis owing to its therapeutic effects. Our findings highlight the potential of this innovative hydrogel system for stable iodine application under humid and aqueous physiological conditions, offering a promising platform for future antibacterial therapies in clinical settings."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: No studies have reported the use of the Biosensor TSAb assay (TSAb (Bio)) for predicting the therapeutic efficacy of radioactive iodine therapy (RAIT) for Graves' disease (GD). Therefore, we evaluated the usefulness of this novel thyroid-stimulating antibody (TSAb) bioassay kit, which uses a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) biosensor, in predicting the therapeutic efficacy of RAIT in 20 patients with GD. METHODS: We defined the RAIT outcome using two criteria: (i) thyroid weight reduction to <8 g and (ii) thyroid weight reduction to >80% at 12 months post-RAIT. For criteria (i) and (ii), regression analysis was performed for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor autoantibody (TRAb), TSAb (Bio), TSAb (Bio)/TRAb, I-131 absorbed dose/TSAb (Bio), and I-131 absorbed dose/(TSAb (Bio)/TRAb). After evaluating the significance of each factor, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Among the five aforementioned anti-TSH receptor antibody parameters, only I-131 absorbed dose/(TSAb (Bio)/TRAb) showed statistical significance in the multivariate analysis (p = 0.004 and p = 0.021 for each criterion). Although I-131 absorbed dose/(TSAb (Bio)/TRAb) correlated significantly with the thyroid weight (r = -0.54, p = 0.015), it did not correlate with thyroid weight reduction rates at 12 months post-RAIT. ROC analysis also demonstrated a good predictive value (area under the curve of approximately 0.8 with a cut-off value of 3.9) for I-131 absorbed dose/(TSAb (Bio)/TRAb) in predicting thyroid weight at 12 months post-RAIT. CONCLUSIONS: TSAb (Bio) is a useful predictor of RAIT efficacy when evaluated as I-131 absorbed dose/(TSAb (Bio)/TRAb). This index was defined by dividing a factor that positively affects RAIT outcomes (I-131 absorbed dose) by a factor negatively affecting it (i.e., (TSAb (Bio)/TRAb)). The therapeutic efficacy of RAIT can be expected with an I-131 absorbed dose/(TSAb (Bio)/TRAb) value of ≥3.9. Adjusting the I-131 dosage based on this index may lead to more effective treatment outcomes."

      "abstract": "Thyroid cancer, one of the most common endocrine tumors, generally has a favorable prognosis but remains a significant medical and societal concern due to its high incidence. Early diagnosis and treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) significantly affect long-term outcomes, requiring the selection and application of appropriate initial treatments to improve prognosis and quality of life. Recent advances in technology and health information systems have enhanced our understanding of the molecular genetics of thyroid cancer, facilitating the identification of aggressive subgroups and enabling the accumulation of research on risk factors through big data. The Korean Thyroid Association (KTA) has revised the \"KTA Guidelines on the Management of Differentiated Thyroid Cancers 2024\" to incorporate these advances, which were developed by a multidisciplinary team and underwent extensive review and approval processes by various academic societies. This article summarizes the 2024 KTA guidelines for radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy in patients with DTC, written by the Nuclear Medicine members of the KTA Guideline Committee, and covers RAI therapy as initial management of DTC and RAI therapy in advanced thyroid cancer."

This research evaluated the efficacy of 99Tcm-DTPA orbital SPECT/CT combined with thyroid function test in radioactive iodine I-131 (RAI) treatment of TAO-hyperthyroidism. METHODS: We retrospectively studied clinical activity score (CAS), blood thyrotropine (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), thickness of extra-ocular muscle (EOM), and uptake rate (UR) of 99Tcm-DTPA orbital SPECT/CT of 43 patients after 6 months of treatment with 20 mCi RAI. Parameters were compared before and after RAI in patients assessed as effectively treated (normal thyroid function or hypothyroidism), and correlations between blood FSH, FT3, FT4, thickness of EOM, and UR were analyzed after treatment. RESULTS: After RAI, 35 cases (70 eyes, 81.4%) had normal or hypothyroidism, and 8 cases (16 eyes, 18.6%) had hyperthyroidism. Compared with the patients who failed treatment, effectively treated patients had lower CAS, FT3, FT4, and UR and higher blood TSH. In patients with effective treatment, UR of the inferior rectus muscle was positively correlated with FT3 and FT4. Adverse RAI outcomes were associated with smoking and higher iodine-thyroid iodine uptake before treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Combined with TSH, FT3, and FT4 levels, the reduction of 99Tcm-DTPA orbital SPECT/CT UR also indicates an improvement in the disease course of patients. The UR of the inferior rectus muscle can be an objective index to evaluate the curative effect of TAO patients."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictive value of tumor iodine concentration obtained with dual-energy CT (DECT) for treatment response in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective single-center study of consecutive metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients undergoing first-line ICI treatment. The iodine concentration measurement time points include prior to initiation of therapy (baseline [BL]), after initiation (follow-up [FU1]), and either time point nearest to 12 months or at time of progression (final follow-up [FFU]). Target lesion DECT-based whole-volume tumor normalized iodine concentration average (NICave) and size measurements were obtained. Reference standard was individual lesion FFU status categorized as responders or nonresponders per RECIST 1.1. Logistic regression model assessed NICave change and FU1 lesion response as predictors of FFU lesion outcome. Model's performance was summarized with AUC. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) summarized inter-rater agreement of NICave. RESULTS: Forty-six patients were included (mean age 61 ± 11 years, 12 women; 16 melanoma). Sixty-four of 175 target lesions were confirmed nonresponders at FFU. In a multivariable model, lesion status at FU1 (odds ratio [OR]: 27.4, p < 0.001) and changes in NICave from BL to FU1 (OR: 2.42 per 1-SD increase, p = 0.019) were significant predictors of lesion status at FFU. The model's AUC was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.76-0.93). Inter-rater reliability of NICave was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.97-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in iodine concentration from baseline to first follow-up improve identification of delayed responding metastatic melanoma and RCC lesions treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor, initially classified as nonresponders by size change. KEY POINTS: Question How can pseudoprogression/delayed treatment response in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and melanoma patients on first-line immune checkpoint inhibitors be accurately identified? Findings Combining iodine concentration change from Dual-energy CT (baseline to first follow-up) with RECIST-based lesion size change improved prediction of final lesion outcome. Clinical relevance DECT-based whole-volume tumor iodine concentration for target lesions is useful as a predictive imaging biomarker for distinguishing delayed response from true progression in patients with metastatic RCC and melanoma treated with first-line immune checkpoint inhibitors."

      "abstract": "Iodine is a key micronutrient essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormone, which regulates metabolic processes and maintains overall health. Despite its importance, iodine deficiency is a global health issue, leading to disorders such as goiter, hypothyroidism, and developmental abnormalities. Biofortification of crops with iodine is a promising strategy to enhance the dietary iodine intake, providing an alternative to iodized salt. Curly kale (Brassica oleracea var. sabellica) is a nutrient-rich vegetable high in vitamins A, C, K; minerals; fiber; and bioactive compounds with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and detoxifying properties. This study evaluates the effects of diets containing iodine-biofortified curly kale ('Oldenbor F1' and 'Redbor F1') on iodine content, tissue iodine levels, and various biochemical parameters in laboratory rats. The biofortified curly kale was enriched with 5,7-diiodo-8-quinolinol. The iodine content in the AIN-93G (control) diet and the non-biofortified curly kale diets did not differ significantly. However, diets with 5,7-diiodo-8-quinolinol biofortified kale showed significantly higher iodine levels compared with the control diets. Tissue analysis revealed the highest iodine concentrations in the liver and kidneys of rats fed diets with biofortified curly kale, indicating better iodine bioavailability. Biochemical analysis showed that rats fed the biofortified kale diet had lower total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels compared with rats fed the control diet. Additionally, the biofortified diet improved the liver function markers (ALAT, ASAT) and reduced oxidative stress markers (TBARS). The study also investigated the expression of thyroid-related genes (Slc5A5, Tpo, Dio1, Dio2) in response to diets containing biofortified kale. The results demonstrated significant changes in gene expression, indicating adaptive mechanisms to dietary iodine levels and the presence of bioactive compounds in the biofortified kale. The study also observed variations in uric acid levels, with lower concentrations in rats fed a diet with biofortified curly kale. Biofortified curly kale supports thyroid function and improves liver and kidney health by reducing oxidative stress and modulating key biochemical and genetic markers. These findings suggest that biofortified curly kale can effectively increase dietary iodine intake as a nutritional intervention to address iodine deficiency and promote overall health.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radioactive iodine (RAI) is a common treatment for various thyroid diseases. Previous studies have suggested susceptibility of parathyroid glands to the mutagenic effect of RAI and the development of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). We tested the possible link between prior RAI treatment, disease presentation, and treatment outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 704 individuals who underwent parathyroidectomy for PHPT at a tertiary care center between the years 2015 and 2023 was performed. Preoperative and postoperative parameters, including demographic characteristics, biochemical markers, imaging data, and surgical and pathology findings were collected and analyzed to compare differences in patients who had previous RAI treatment and those who did not (non-RAI). Univariate statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients had a history of RAI treatment. Indications for RAI treatment included hyperthyroidism (n = 18), papillary thyroid cancer (n = 6), subacute thyroiditis (n = 1), follicular cancer (n = 1), and toxic goiter (n = 1). Average latency time between RAI exposure and development of PHPT was 18.4 ys. On comparison of the two groups, there was no difference in age, sex, race/ethnicity, day of surgery body mass index, preoperative parathyroid hormone, calcium, glomerular filtration rate, creatinine, vitamin D, or phosphate levels. There was also no difference in preoperative diagnosis of osteoporosis or nephrolithiasis. Postoperatively, there was no difference in parathyroid hormone, calcium, or creatinine levels, or in rate of cure. There was significantly higher chance of unilateral exploration in the operating room (75.9% RAI, 54.1% non-RAI, P = 0.02) and increased rate of single-gland disease in the RAI group, although the latter finding was not statistically significant (79.3% RAI, 65.2% non-RAI, P = 0.12). There was no difference in adenoma size as noted on the pathology report (greatest dimension 1.7 cm RAI, 1.7 cm non-RAI, P = 0.28). Subgroup analysis of the RAI group based on reason for RAI treatment (cancer versus hyperthyroidism) showed no statistically significant differences in the examined demographic or clinical data. CONCLUSIONS: There does not seem to be a relationship between prior RAI treatment and the clinical presentation of PHPT. Additionally, differences in RAI dose do not appear to be associated with a change in clinical presentation. Our study revalidates that age and latency are inversely related, which is a previously shown finding. Clinicians may be reassured that patients with prior RAI history may not have differences in clinical characteristics, disease presentation, or treatment outcomes.",

We retrospectively studied 201 patients with an AFTN who received RAIT at a dose of 500 MBq and were followed up for more than 2 years. Thyroid function at diagnosis, thyroid antibody positivity, treatment with antithyroid drugs before RAIT, cystic components of the nodule, and 131I uptake outside the nodule were assessed. Nodule enlargement was observed in 18 patients (9%), persistent hyperthyroidism in 13 patients (6.5%), and hypothyroidism in 45 patients (22.3%). Nodule volume before RAIT was significantly larger in the nodule enlargement group compared to the non-enlargement group. The risk factors for persistent hyperthyroidism were larger nodule volume and absence of a cystic component in multivariate analysis. The cutoff nodule volume before RAIT for predicting nodule enlargement was 15.5 mL, and for predicting persistent hyperthyroidism was 16.6 mL. Nodule volume decreased to 47% in the first year and continued to gradually decrease thereafter. This study provided long-term outcome data regarding nodule volume change and thyroid function in AFTN patients following single fixed-dose RAIT, and it identified risk factors for nodule enlargement and persistent hyperthyroidism after RAIT. Nodule volume before treatment was a good predictor of treatment response."

The cohort was divided into training (70%) and validation (30%) sets for nomogram development. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Nomograms were developed based on these predictors, and Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed for validation. Among 451 patients who were screened, 412 met the inclusion criteria and were followed-up for a median duration of 65.2 months. The training and validation sets included 288 and 124 patients, respectively. Pathological type, first 131I administrated activity, and lesion 131I uptake in lesions were independent predictors for PFS. For OS, predictors included gender, age, metastasis site, first 131I administrated activity, 131I uptake, pulmonary lesion size, and stimulated thyroglobulin levels. These predictors were used to construct nomograms for predicting PFS and OS. Low-risk patients had significantly longer PFS and OS compared to high-risk patients, with 10-year PFS rates of 81.1% vs. 51.9% and 10-year OS rates of 86.2% vs. 37.4%. These may aid individualized prognostic assessment and clinical decision-making, especially in determining the prescribed activity for the first 131I treatment.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we introduce a highly effective non-metallic iodine single-atom catalyst (SAC), referred to as I-NC, which is strategically confined within a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) scaffold. This configuration features a distinctive C-I coordination that optimizes the electronic structure of the nitrogen-adjacent carbon sites. As a result, this arrangement enhances electron transfer from peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to the active sites, particularly the electron-deficient carbon. This electron transfer is followed by a deprotonation process that generates the peroxymonosulfate radical (SO5•-). Subsequently, the SO5•- radical undergoes a disproportionation reaction, leading to the production of singlet oxygen (1O2). Furthermore, the energy barrier for the rate-limiting step of SO5•- generation in I-NC is significantly lower at 1.45 eV, compared to 1.65 eV in the NC scaffold. This reduction in energy barrier effectively overcomes kinetic obstacles, thereby facilitating an enhanced generation of 1O2. Consequently, the I-NC catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic efficiency and unmatched reactivity for PMS activation. This leads to a significantly accelerated degradation of pollutants, evidenced by a relatively high observed kinetic rate constant (kobs ~ 0.436 min-1) compared to other metallic SACs. This study offers valuable insights into the rational design of effective non-metallic SACs, showcasing their promising potential for Fenton-like reactions in water treatment applications."

      "abstract": "Iodine has an anti-proliferative effect on cancer cells; however, its effects have not been explored adequately. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of iodine and radioiodine by assessing their effects on the viability of various breast cancer cell lines: MCF7, SKBR3, and MDA-MB231. The viability of cells was measured in treated cells exposed to six doses of iodine (5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 µM) and two doses of radioiodine (3.7 × 104 and 3.7 × 105 Bq). A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and modified clonogenic assays were used to assess cell viability. Exposure to 80 µM of iodine significantly reduced the viability of all cell types. The cells were then exposed to a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) dose. When the cells were exposed to the IC50 dose of iodine, the MCF7 cell viability was reduced by 42.6 ± 0.14% (IC50 dose 12.88 µM), 40.2 ± 0.08% for SKBR3 (IC50 dose 11.03 µM) and 47.0 ± 0.02% for MDA-MB231 (IC50 dose 14.09 µM). All cells were also exposed to 3.7 × 104 Bq and 3.7 × 105 Bq radioiodine. Both doses significantly reduced the cell viability of MCF7 and SKBR3 cells compared to the unexposed control cells (all had p < 0.05), while MDA-MB231 cell viability only reduced significantly after 3.7 × 105 Bq of radioiodine exposure compared to the unexposed control cells (p < 0.05). This study highlighted that iodine had a toxic effect on breast cancer cells, and radioiodine enhanced the toxicity to breast cancer cells. The types of cancer cells and doses of iodine and radioiodine influenced the effect. These findings suggest that iodine and radioiodine hold promise as therapeutic agents for breast cancer, similar to their established use in thyroid disease treatment. However, further in vivo studies are important to provide more evidence.",

      "abstract": "Objective.The treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy requires careful consideration of consequences for both maternal and fetal health. In non-pregnant patients, the use of radioactive iodine-125 (125I)-seeds is standard practice for localising non-palpable breast tumors before breast-conserving surgery. However, the use of125I-seeds in pregnant patients has been avoided due to concerns about fetal radiation exposure.Approach.In this study a mathematical model was developed to estimate the fetal absorbed dose based on several factors: the radioactivity of the125I-seed, the duration of implantation, and the distance between the125I-seed and fetus as a function of maternal anatomy, gestational age, and fetal development. Three scenarios, representing a range of maternal and fetal anatomy, were evaluated, including a worst-case scenario from a radiation safety perspective.Main results.The results show that the fetal absorbed dose varies across the three scenarios, with ranges of 0.0-0.4 mGy, 0.0-1.0 mGy, and 0.0-1.6 mGy, depending on when the125I-seed was implanted and when it was removed. These dose ranges are similar to conventional diagnostic x-ray scans. The maximum calculated absorbed dose (1.6 mGy) is unlikely to be reached in practice and is well below the 100 mGy threshold associated with possible fetal malformations. The associated theoretical cancer risk increase (0.016%) is minimal.Significance.The use of125I-seeds as localisation method of breast tumors in pregnant patients results in low fetal radiation doses and should not be avoided due to dose concerns.",

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of Lugol's iodine-enhanced micro-computed tomography (CT) for the 3D measurement of DOI in OSCC samples. METHODOLOGY: In total, 50 in vitro OSCC samples from Nanjing Stomatological Hospital (July 2022 to January 2024) were subjected to micro-CT imaging with a slice thickness of 50 μm following 3% Lugol iodine staining for 12 h, followed by pathological examination and staining. The panoramic diagnostic scanner digitally measured pathological DOI. The micro-CT DOI was measured by evaluating the voxel value of the boundary of the tumor lesion and comparing it with the pathological examination results. Experienced physicians analyzed both measurements, and statistical analyses were performed to determine their correlation. RESULTS: Lugol iodine-enhanced micro-CT imaging distinguishes various tissue structures, such as tumor tissue, epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, blood vessel structure, and other major tissue structures in 3D space. This imaging technique found and localized micro-tumor lesions (1.82×1.5×1 mm3) when in conjunction with pathological sections. Statistical analysis indicated a strong correlation between pathological DOI and micro-CT DOI (P<.001; r=0.986). During DOI measurement, Lugol iodine-enhanced micro-CT imaging effectively compensated for the loss of 3D space information in the pathological measurements, improving the accuracy of the DOI measurement. CONCLUSIONS: Lugol iodine-enhanced micro-CT improves OSCC DOI 3D measurements, enhances pathological staging accuracy, and aids treatment decisions and prognosis.",

METHODS: From January 2010 to June 2023, the clinical data of 126 patients with unresectable HCC (≤5 cm) in high-risk locations who received TACE-RFA-125I or TACE-RFA treatment were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical outcomes between the two groups were compared after propensity score matching (PSM) analysis. RESULTS: Forty-six pairs of patients were matched. The local progression-free survival rates at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-years were 100%, 82.4%, 74.8%, 63.5%, and 54% in the TACE-RFA-125I group, which were significantly higher than 91.3%, 69.4%, 50.7%, 29.4%, and 26.7% in the TACE-RFA group, respectively (p = 0.004). The median progression-free survival in the TACE-RFA-125I group was significantly longer than that in the TACE-RFA group (p = 0.002). The overall survival rates at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-years were 100%, 93.4%, 80.7%, 74.9%, and 64.7% in the TACE-RFA-125I group, which were significantly higher than 97.8%, 78%, 68.6%, 51.1%, and 45.3% in the TACE-RFA group, respectively (p = 0.011). There was no occurrence of major complications or procedure-related deaths in the two groups. CONCLUSION: Compared with the TACE-RFA treatment, TACE-RFA-125I should be a more effective treatment strategy for patients with unresectable HCC (≤5 cm) in high-risk locations."

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: There exist three principal treatment modalities employed in the management of hyperthyroidism attributable to excessive hormone secretion by the thyroid gland: antithyroid pharmacotherapy, surgical intervention, and radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy. Surgical intervention is typically indicated for markedly enlarged thyroid glands that exert pressure on the trachea. The objective of this investigation was to ascertain the influence of RAI on thyroid volume and tracheal diameter. Methods: This study included 20 patients, six females and 14 males, who received 20 mCi radioactive iodine treatment for toxic nodular goiter at a tertiary university hospital between March 2019 and February 2020. Pre-treatment and six-month post-treatment neck MRI scans were conducted on the cohort. Thyroid and tracheal volumes were quantified using the Cavalieri method based on MRI sections, and comparisons were conducted pre-and post-treatment. Statistical analysis of the comparative values was performed using the dependent samples t-test. Results: A statistically significant reduction in thyroid volume was observed among the 20 patients, averaging a decrease of 36.06% following RAI treatment compared to baseline measurements (p < 0.001). Additionally, an average increase of 12.76% in tracheal volume was noted post-treatment in comparison to initial measurements, which was also statistically significant (p < 0.05). None of the patients exhibited respiratory distress in the immediate postoperative period. Conclusions: The findings indicate that RAI therapy leads to a reduction in thyroid size, accompanied by an increase in tracheal diameters subsequent to treatment. Given the potential complications and risks associated with surgical intervention, it may be prudent to consider large thyroids for RAI therapy as an alternative to surgery."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Pediatric populations with well-differentiated thyroid cancer typically have favorable prognoses. However, the role of radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation in these patients remains uncertain. This investigation evaluates the national trends, therapeutic practices, and the impact of RAI on clinical outcomes. METHODS: Patients aged 21 years or younger with differentiated thyroid cancer, identified from the SEER database between 2000 and 2019, were analyzed. We compared the treatment approaches and survival outcomes of patients who underwent RAI ablation with those who did not. RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study encompassed 5318 pediatric patients, with 55.9% (n = 2973) who underwent RAI ablation. RAI utilization declined from 65% to 38.4% in 2019. Compared with those who did not undergo RAI, RAI patients presented with a larger tumor size (mean size: 27.7 vs. 20.4 mm), a higher T3/T4 stage (35.8% vs. 15.3%), nodal metastases (60.7% vs. 28.8%), and distant metastases (2.7% vs. 0.9%) (all p < 0.001). Despite this, RAI was not an independent predictor of recurrence, second malignancy, or mortality. The analysis showed no significant differences in long-term survival between the RAI and non-RAI groups (p > 0.05), with African American patients having an increased risk of mortality (HR = 3.81; p = 0.038). Cancer-directed surgery emerged as a protective factor (HR = 0.08; p = 0.018), while RAI treatment did not significantly affect mortality risk (p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Excellent pediatric thyroid cancer outcomes were achieved regardless of RAI use. Further research should clarify appropriate RAI indications while addressing racial outcome inequities."

      "abstract": "Background: Radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation therapy is a common minimally invasive treatment for patients diagnosed with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Although previous studies have identified a link between RAI and the mortality from secondary solid cancers, the connection between RAI and leukemia remains under-researched. This study investigated the differential risk of leukemia and its subtypes in DTC patients following RAI treatment. Methods: DTC patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Registry 17 (2000-2019) were analyzed. The standard incidence ratio (SIR) and excess risk (ER) compared to the reference population were calculated. Results: Out of 196,569 DTC patients, 1381 patients developed various types of hematological malignancies. Leukemia was diagnosed in 508 of these patients, and it had the highest risk among the malignancies studied, with an SIR of 1.74 (95%CI: 1.59-1.9). The RAI group had an SIR of 2.12 (95%CI: 1.87-2.39), while the non-RAI group had an SIR was 1.45 (95%CI: 1.37-1.52) (p < 0.001). Those diagnosed before the age of 55 years had a conspicuously elevated risk (SIR 2.74) compared to those diagnosed at 55 years or older (SIR 1.53). American Indian/Alaska Native survivors manifested a pronounced leukemia risk with an SIR of 7.63 (95%CI: 2.46-17.8). Conclusions: RAI treatment increased the risk of developing leukemia when serving as adjuvant therapy in surgical patients (SIR 2.12). There exists a significant association between RAI treatment in DTC patients and the incidence of leukemia. This susceptibility seems to be modulated by factors including time since diagnosis, age, gender, and racial background."

      "abstract": "Starting from the metabolic profile of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we hypothesized that the mechanisms of ¹³¹I-induced cardiotoxicity differ between patients diagnosed with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) with/without T2DM, with metformin potentially acting as a cardioprotective agent by mitigating inflammation in patients with T2DM. To address this hypothesis, we quantified, using ELISA, the serum concentration of several key biomarkers that reflect cardiac injury (NT-proBNP, NT-proANP, ST2/IL-33R, and cTn I) in 74 female patients with DTC/-T2DM and 25 with DTC/+T2DM treated with metformin. All patients received a cumulative oral dose of 131I exceeding 150 mCi (5.55 GBq) over approximately 53 months. Our results showed the following: (i) In DTC/-T2DM patients, high-cumulative 131I doses promote a pro-inflammatory state that accelerates the development of cardiotoxicity. Monitoring NT-proBNP, ST2/IL-33R, and cTn I in these patients may help identify those at risk of developing cardiac complications. (ii) In patients with DTC/+T2DM, high-cumulative 131I doses lead to the release of NT-proANP (r = 0.63), which signals that the atria are under significant stress. (iii) In patients with DTC/+T2DM, metformin suppresses inflammation, leading to a dose-dependent reduction in cTn I (r = -0.59). Monitoring cTn I and NT-proANP, and considering the use of metformin as part of the therapeutic strategy, could help manage cardiotoxicity in T2DM patients undergoing 131I therapy.",

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cause of cancer‑related mortality and morbidity worldwide. While iodine‑125 (125I) particle brachytherapy has been extensively used in the clinical treatment of various types of cancer, the precise mechanism underlying its effectiveness in treating HCC remains unclear. In the present study, MHCC‑97H cells were treated with 125I, after which, cell viability and proliferation were assessed using Cell Counting Kit‑8, 5‑ethynyl‑2'‑deoxyuridine and colony formation assays, cell invasion and migration were evaluated using wound healing and Transwell assays, and cell apoptosis was determined using flow cytometry. Omics data were analyzed using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Gene Ontology and STRING analyses to observe the key genes that exhibited significant changes at the transcriptional and protein levels in MHCC‑97H cells treated with 125I particles. Finally, the expression levels of key genes (GPNMB, C4BPA, CTH, H1‑0 and MT2A) were verified through reverse transcription quantitative PCR. Following treatment with 125I, the proliferation, invasion and migration of MHCC‑97H cells were inhibited, and apoptosis was enhanced. The results of omics data analysis indicated that the biological behavior of MHCC‑97H cells treated with 125I was related to the expression levels of CTH and MT2A genes. These findings indicated that intervention with 125I radiation particles may induce changes in gene expression, potentially influencing alterations in biological characteristics. In conclusion, these insights may shed light on the underlying mechanisms of 125I radiation particle therapy in HCC and offer novel targets for HCC treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer primarily affects young women and raises concerns about future fertility due to treatments of thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy. This study investigated the effects of these treatments on pregnancy probability in young female patients post-diagnosis. METHODS: A nationwide, population-based study using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (2000-2017) examined pregnancy likelihood in women ≤45 years with thyroid cancer. The effects of thyroidectomy and RAI therapy on pregnancy were analyzed using logistic regression and Cox proportional-hazards models. RESULTS: In a cohort of 10 937 patients with thyroid cancer, 7022 (64.2%) underwent total thyroidectomy, with 718 receiving RAI treatment. The type of thyroidectomy and RAI treatment, even at doses exceeding 120 millicuries, did not reduce the likelihood of pregnancy. Age was identified as the most critical factor influencing pregnancy; women aged >30 years had a significantly lower likelihood of becoming pregnant than younger women did. Other factors associated with a reduced likelihood of pregnancy included comorbidity with diabetes (HR = 0.65, P = .002) and higher socioeconomic status (HR = 0.69, P = .085). CONCLUSIONS: Thyroidectomy and RAI therapy do not diminish pregnancy probability in young women with thyroid cancer. Age remains a crucial factor, with younger women more likely to conceive. These findings are critical for fertility counseling and treatment planning. Key message What is already known on this subjec?  Thyroid cancer primarily affects young women, and its standard treatments, including thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, have raised concerns about their potential impact on fertility. Previous studies have shown that RAI treatment may temporarily affect ovarian function but typically does not have a significant long-term effect on fertility. What this study adds?  This nationwide population-based study found that neither total nor partial thyroidectomy, nor RAI treatment, adversely affects the likelihood of pregnancy in young women with thyroid cancer. Age was identified as the most significant factor influencing pregnancy, with younger women having a higher probability of becoming pregnant after treatment. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy?  Clinicians should recognize that age, rather than the type of thyroidectomy or RAI treatment, is the most critical factor influencing fertility in young women with thyroid cancer. This insight can guide personalized fertility counseling and treatment planning to optimize outcomes."

This review aims to present a comprehensive evaluation of the clinical applications of I-123 MIBG, focusing on its use in diagnosing and managing various diseases. In cardiology, I-123 MIBG has proven invaluable in assessing cardiac sympathetic innervation, particularly in patients with heart failure, where it provides prognostic information that guides treatment strategies. In oncology, I-123 MIBG is primarily utilized for imaging neuroendocrine tumors, such as neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma, where it offers high specificity and sensitivity in the detection of adrenergic tissue. Additionally, its role in neurology, specifically in differentiating between Parkinson's disease, dementia, and Lewy body dementia, has become increasingly significant due to its ability to identify postganglionic sympathetic dysfunction. Despite its established clinical utility, the use of I-123 MIBG is not without limitations, including variability in imaging protocols and interpretation challenges. This review will explore these issues and discuss emerging alternatives, while also highlighting areas where I-123 MIBG continues to be a gold standard. By synthesizing the current research, this article aims to provide a clear understanding of the strengths, limitations, and prospects of I-123 MIBG in clinical practice."

It exhibits significant adsorption capacity for the removal of heavy metals and in wastewater treatment, rendering it a highly esteemed adsorbent material. However, the potential of lignin-derived porous carbon for the capture of iodine in environmental contexts has yet to be thoroughly investigated. This research aims to examine the iodine capture capabilities of lignin-derived porous carbon in both iodine vapor and iodine/cyclohexane solution. Initially, lignin derivatives (ADL) (Mn = 2.85 × 104, Mw / Mn = 1. 73) were synthesized through the graft copolymerization of lignin (Mn ≈ 2500), 4-acetoxystyrene, and dienopropyl terephthalate in ethylene glycol, utilizing azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as the initiator. Subsequently, ADL was transformed into layered lignin-based porous carbon (ADLC) by one-step carbonization and zinc chloride activation. The iodine adsorption capacity of ADLC was determined to be 2340 mg/g in an iodine vapor environment and 354 mg/g in a 500 mg/L iodine/cyclohexane solution. These findings indicate that the layered porous carbon (ADLC) derived from lignin represents a promising material for iodine capture, providing an economical, stable, and environmentally friendly approach to nuclear waste management.",

In this study, factors influencing the development of hypothyroidism after 131I therapy for Graves' hyperthyroidism were evaluated. This was a retrospective study with a 12-month follow-up. Retrospectively, we investigated 1,264 patients with diagnosed Graves' disease who received 131I therapy using the Marinelli-Quimby formula. The first three months after 131I therapy, hypothyroidism risk was higher among patients with lighter thyroid weight, higher levels of thyroglobulin antibody (TGAb), and shorter durations of Antithyroid drug (ATD) treatment before 131I therapy (P < 0.05). After 6 months, patients with lighter thyroid weight, shorter ATD treatment duration before 131I therapy, and higher iodine intake showed an increased risk of hypothyroidism. (P < 0.05). After one year, lower 24-h iodine uptake was the only risk factor for hypothyroidism (P < 0.05). Our results show that  131I is an effective therapy for GD. Even if over time, the occurrence of hypothyroidism may ultimately depend on the patients' radiosensitivity to 131I before treatment.

ICT and iodine-131 (131I) radiation can induce immunogenic cell death, which, in combination with R848, will boost dendritic cell (DC) maturation. Decellularized liver model and SPECT/CT imaging revealed high specificity and long retention of microspheres. Radioactive distribution of 131I in tumor on 7 d following 131I-MS injection was over 7 times of that in normal liver tissue (4.26 ± 1.21 % ID/g vs 0.57 ± 0.23 % ID/g). 131I-ICT/R848-MS embolization brought significant immune activation, where the ratio of cytotoxic T lymphocytes to regulatory T cells in tumor sites upregulated from 1.75 ± 0.20 to 24.31 ± 1.79, and DC maturation in lymph nodes increased from 8.90 ± 1.51 % to 34.70 ± 3.12 %. Enhanced anti-tumor efficacy with no relapse was proved in rat orthotopic N1S1 HCC models. These results demonstrated the great potential of this multifunctional embolic agent to treat HCC through transarterial radio-immuno-chemoembolization (TARICE).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hepatogastric fistula (HGF) is an uncommon occurrence that can be associated with various medical conditions. The primary causes typically involve peptic ulcer disease, infections (such as pyogenic, amoebic or tuberculosis), or iatrogenic factors (like post transarterial chemoembolization or radiotherapy). Massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage following HGF is extremely rare, with iodine-125 (125I) seed migration to the stomach through HGF not previously documented. This report explores this unique case and reviews other recent instances of rare gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to HGF. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 32-year-old man with chronic B viral hepatitis underwent emergency surgery to control bleeding due to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rupture. One month postoperatively, an active residual tumor (44 mm × 33 mm) was found in the caudate lobe of the liver. The patient was admitted for percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy (PMCT) and 125I seed implantation sequentially. No postoperative discomfort was observed. Subsequent intrahepatic HCC distant recurrences were successfully managed using PMCT and systemic treatments (molecular targeted drug and checkpoint inhibitor). Twenty months after the initial seed implantation in the caudate lobe, the patient was referred again owing to intrahepatic tumor recurrence in the right lobe and underwent repeat PMCT and 125I seed implantation. Two days after the second 125I seed implantation, the patient presented with severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding and epigastric pain. The caudate lobe was in communication with the lesser curvature of the stomach, resulting in the formation of the HGF. Subsequently, intermittent massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred, and seed implantation in the caudate lobe migrated to the stomach through the HGF. Endoscopy and imaging confirmed HGF and seed migration to the stomach, and surgery was successfully performed. CONCLUSIONS: A thorough clinical medical history and heightened vigilance are essential for diagnosing and managing this rare complication."

Objectives: To assess the safety and efficacy of a 1% povidone-iodine (PVI) ophthalmic solution lid scrub compared to formulated eyelid wipes in treating AB. Design: A prospective, randomized, controlled, observer-masked, paired-eye trial. Methods: Sixty-three AB patients were randomly assigned to a 30-day treatment in which one eye underwent a daily lid scrub with 1% PVI solution (1% PVI group), while the fellow eye was treated with formulated eyelid wipes (control group). Clinical outcomes, such as blepharitis signs, tear breakup time, and corneal staining, were evaluated at study enrollment and exit visits. Symptom assessments utilized the visual analog scale (VAS) per eye and the ocular surface disease index (OSDI) questionnaire. Results: Fifty-two patients (mean age 62.3 years, 53.8% females) completed the treatment, while seven patients were lost to follow-up, three were non-compliant, and one sustained an eye trauma. After 30 days, both the 1% PVI and control groups exhibited significant improvements in symptoms, blepharitis signs, and corneal staining (p < 0.05). The 1% PVI scrubs were equally effective as eyelid wipes in most outcomes (p = 0.480) and superior in alleviating eyelid erythema (p = 0.007). Only the 1% PVI group showed a positive correlation between OSDI and VAS score improvements (r (52) = 0.353, p = 0.01). No adverse events related to either treatment modality were reported. Conclusions: A 1% PVI solution is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment option for AB and is superior to formulated eyelid wipes in several subjective and objective measures."

      "abstract": "Patients with intermediate-risk thyroid cancers may undergo treatment with radioactive iodine-131 (I-131). They often undergo a pretreatment diagnostic iodine scan that typically shows areas of physiological uptake in the stomach, bladder, parotid glands as well as thyroid-remnant uptake and sites of metastatic disease. A 48-year-old woman with intermediate-risk papillary thyroid cancer with metastases to lateral compartment lymph nodes was found to have increased retention of iodine in the medial portion of her left orbit on the diagnostic scan. This was suggestive of preexisting nasolacrimal duct stenosis leading to retention of secretions in the lacrimal sac, raising concerns that the I-131 used in treatment would have delayed clearance that could further damage her lacrimal sac and eye. In consultation with ophthalmology, the patient received pretreatment azelastine and prednisolone drops and underwent treatment with radioactive iodine followed by saline lacrimal irrigation. Though she had subsequent eye pain and swelling necessitating repeated irrigation, the patient was able to undergo treatment for her papillary thyroid cancer and retained full function of her eye. This case highlights an approach that could be used for patients with nasolacrimal duct stenosis in whom radioactive iodine treatment is deemed beneficial."

      "abstract": "The occurrence of post-radioactive iodine thyroid storm among patients with hyperthyroidism is relatively rare and only a few cases have been reported. We conducted a literature review of cases reported from 1951 to 2023 and determined the risk factors and clinical characteristics of patients who developed thyroid storm. A total of 19 cases were documented and reviewed. The mean age was 51.2 ± 20.1 years (range 7.5 to 75). Approximately two-thirds were females. Major etiologies were diffuse toxic goiter (57.9%) and nodular disease (36.8%). Mean dose was 11.3 ± 7.7 mCi (range 3.3 to 35), with 52.6% receiving less than 10 mCi. Mean interval time from administration to development of thyroid storm was 6.6 ± 5.5 days (range 0.5 to 20). The most common preexisting conditions were weight loss, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension and coronary artery disease. Thyroxine levels were not routinely measured prior to and during storm. Among those with available data, only 26.3% had hormone levels prior to and during storm. Thyroxine levels during storm (range 19.8 to 65 µg/dL) were higher than levels prior to storm (range 9.6 to 45 µg/dL). Pretreatment regimens varied consisting of no intervention, beta blockers, steroids, reserpine, phenobarbital and anti-thyroid drugs. Treatment regimens are more uniform and consistent with American Thyroid Association recommendations. The mortality rate remains high at ~ 26.3%. Statistical analyses did not show any significant differences. Even though the frequency of this condition is quite rare, it is an important and potentially prognostic condition underscoring the value of this review. The inclusion of this severe adverse effect should be part of patient discussion with emphasis on the need to seek early consultation when severe symptoms appear."

      "abstract": "Radioactive iodine-125 (125I) seed implantation, a brachytherapy technique, effectively kills tumor cells via X-rays and gamma rays, serving as an alternative therapeutic option following the failure of frontline treatments for various solid tumors. However, tumor radioresistance limits its efficacy. Hydrogen gas has anticancer properties and can enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, its role in radiotherapy sensitization has rarely been reported. Many current hydrogen delivery methods involve hydrogen-generating nanomaterials, such as magnesium-based nanomaterials. This study introduces an AZ31 magnesium alloy 125I seed strand (termed AMASS) with pH-dependent slow-release hydrogen characteristics and excellent mechanical properties. AMASS can be implanted into tumors via minimally invasive surgery, releasing hydrogen around the 125I seeds. In vitro experiments showed that hydrogen from AMASS degradation significantly inhibited tumor proliferation, increased apoptosis, disrupted redox homeostasis and mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced adenosine triphosphate levels, and induced DNA damage due to 125I radiation. In mouse xenograft and rabbit liver tumor models, hydrogen from AMASS showed superior therapeutic effects compared with 125I seeds alone, with no noticeable side effects. In addition, AMASS has a uniform radiation dose distribution and simple implantation. Therefore, hydrogen from AMASS enhanced 125I seed efficacy, supporting the further promotion and application of 125I seed implantation in cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "Excessive iodine intake can induce autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT), and the methylation of programmed death receptor 2 (PD-L2) may be involved in the development of iodine-induced AIT. Here, we investigated the immune role of methylation of the susceptibility gene PD-L2 in the occurrence of iodine-induced AIT using the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor Decitabine (Dec) in an experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT) rat model. After injecting Dec intraperitoneally into EAT rats, we performed arsenic-cerium catalytic spectrophotometry, pathological hematoxylin and eosin staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (qMSP), and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to determine the relevant indices. The results showed that compared with the control group, the urinary iodine, thyroid lymphocyte infiltration, thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb), interferon (IFN-γ), and interleukin (IL-23) levels of the EAT rats were significantly increased. The PD-L2 methylation levels were significantly decreased in EAT rats compared to control rats, and the mRNA expression of the PD-L2 was significantly increased. Following Dec intervention, the methylation level of the PD-L2 in rats increased and interferon and interleukin-23 levels decreased, albeit not significantly. However, the mRNA expression of PD-L2 decreased significantly after Dec intervention, and the thyroid function of EAT rats also showed a gradual improvement trend. In summary, hypomethylation of PD-L2 is closely related to the development of iodine-induced AIT. Pro-inflammatory cellular factors are also involved in iodine-induced AIT progression. Although Dec shows promise in the treatment of AIT, further evaluation of its safety is necessary.",

In this study, 131 I low-dose (30 mCi) radioactive waste discarded after radioiodine treatment at a medical institution was collected, and a measuring container was prepared to measure radioactivity concentration according to IAEA standards. The experiments showed that the minimum number of days required for the contamination levels of the inner and outer parts of containers and therapeutic plastics to fall below the tolerance limit were 6, 1, and 5 days, respectively. Conversely, the contamination levels measured immediately after 131 I treatments in the cases of Styrofoam and paper boxes were below the tolerance limit.

      "abstract": "Skin injuries, such as burns, can result in an open wound that can lead to the deterioration of the skin, which acts as a protective barrier against external agents, and can cause serious health problems. Pectin, a plant-derived polysaccharide, is a suitable candidate for wound care due to its gel-forming ability and biocompatibility. Pectin absorbs wound exudates to form a soft gel and is known for its strong anti-inflammatory efects. Pectin-based hydrogel systems promote wound healing by promoting fibroblast proliferation and keratinocyte migration. In the study, 60 male Wistar albino rats were used, and 6 diferent treatment groups were formed: Healthy control, burn control, silver sulfadiazine, pectin-based hydrogel system, pectin-based hydrogel system+iodine, pectin-based hydrogel system+plant extract. Rats with burn wounds were treated for 21 days, and the wound healing process was evaluated by macroscopic, biochemical, and histopathological analysis. The results showed that the pectin-based hydrogel system, iodine, and plant extracts promoted healing in burn wounds. Especially in the groups treated with silver sulfadiazine and plant extracts, the development of granulation tissue and regeneration of collagen fibers showed significant improvement. Furthermore, the pectin-based hydrogel system is thought to contribute to wound healing by maintaining skin moisturization. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) levels decreased in the treatment groups compared to the burn group, and it was determined that these factors play an important role in wound healing. This study shows that pectin-based hydrogel systems can be an efective alternative in burn treatment, and their healing efects can be enhanced by the addition of iodine and plant extracts."

There are varying clinical presentations of pericardial effusion, ranging from asymptomatic incidental findings on chest X-ray (CXR) or point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to hemodynamic instability in cardiac tamponade. Pericardial effusion is a notable cardiac manifestation of severe and long-standing hypothyroidism. We report the case of a 57-year-old female with a previous history of Graves' disease treated with radioactive iodine (RAI) more than 30 years prior but who had never been followed up on post-RAI. Admission CXR depicted a water bottle-shaped cardiomegaly. POCUS portrayed a massive pericardial effusion with no echocardiographic evidence of cardiac tamponade. Laboratory investigations showed raised thyroid-stimulating hormone and low free thyroxine. The pericardial effusion gradually subsided during the surveillance echocardiogram after initiation of thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Early POCUS assessments in this case expedite the diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism-induced pericardial effusion. With timely and adequate thyroid hormone replacement therapy, pericardial effusion can be reversed, thereby averting the fatal complications of cardiac tamponade."

Upon admission, the patient exhibited elevated levels of myocardial enzymes and troponin I. Electrocardiography revealed an acute inferior myocardial infarction. Coronary computed tomography angiography ruled out coronary stenosis; however, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed myocardial congestion and edema. Subsequent examinations revealed increased thyroid hormone levels and decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, which is consistent with the manifestations of hyperthyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with acute fulminant myocarditis accompanied by iodine-induced hyperthyroidism. The patient received no pharmacologic treatment for hyperthyroidism but was prescribed a low-iodine diet, medication, and supportive treatment. His myocardial enzymes and troponin I levels gradually decreased, his electrocardiography and echocardiography results improved, and his cardiac function returned to normal. The patient was discharged and advised to maintain a low-iodine diet. At the 6-month follow-up, the patient's thyroid function and cardiac indicators had returned to normal. This case demonstrates that myocardial injury can result from myocarditis and iodine-induced hyperthyroidism and highlights the importance of closely monitoring and assessing thyroid function during treatment."

Hence, we measured the estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) from 1990 to 2019. Our aim was to quantify the geographic differences in the burden of iodine deficiency worldwide. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019 methodology was employed to investigate the worldwide, regional, and national incidence of iodine deficiency and the accompanying disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). RESULTS: The global age-standardized incidence (ASI) and DALY rates of iodine deficiency declined from 1990 to 2019, with an EAPC of -0.44 and -1.35, respectively. Low and low-middle SDI had much higher ASI and DALY rates of iodine deficiency than other SDI regions. At the regional level, the largest growth in the ASI rate of iodine insufficiency from 1990 to 2019 occurred in East Asia, and at the national level, the greatest increases in the ASI rate of iodine deficiency occurred in the Philippines, Pakistan and Nepal. In addition, males had a lower worldwide ASI rate of iodine insufficiency than females did, with the incidence rate peaking in populations aged 20-24. CONCLUSIONS: Between 1990 and 2019, there was a decline in the global ASI and DALY rates of iodine deficiency. However, East Asia, the Philippines, Pakistan and Nepal exhibited the largest increases in the ASI rates of iodine deficiency, demonstrating their significant burden of iodine insufficiency. These regions must therefore be targeted for intervention."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Graves' disease represents 60%-90% of all causes of thyrotoxicosis in different regions of the world. Thyrotoxicosis contributes approximately 66% to thyroid disorders in South Africa and of those Graves' disease contributes about 34%. In most Sub-Saharan African countries, Graves' disease is managed mainly with medical treatment, due to a lack of or poor access to other means of treatment. Despite the primary use of anti-thyroid drugs (ATD) in the management of Graves' disease, the use of radioactive iodine (RAI) is required in many patients, especially in cases where ATD are contraindicated, or in patients who have failed ATD treatment and are poor surgical candidates. There is no consensus on the best method for deciding on how much activity of radioiodine to administer to patients with Graves' disease, that is, whether to use a calculated dose, or an empirical or fixed dose for RAI. The standardized fixed dose is particularly helpful in under-resourced areas or centres with few nuclear physicians and high patient loads. However, little is known about the efficacy of the fixed dose compared to the calculated or empirical dose methods. The purpose of this retrospective observational study was to assess the efficacy of a fixed low dose of radioiodine-131 (131I) in the treatment of Graves' disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patients treated with a fixed dose of 10mCi between the periods of 2014 to 2017 were evaluated for treatment response after each dose of RAI. Outcome of therapy was evaluated at 3 monthly follow-up using biochemical markers: thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), total free thyroxine (fT4), and or triiodothyronine (T3), and the presence or absence of clinical symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. According to their response to RAI therapy, patients were classified as responders (if they became euthyroid or hypothyroid), non-responders (if they failed to achieve euthyroidism or hypothyroidism at 6 months) and complete treatment failure (if no response was present within 18 months after two or three fixed low doses of RAI). Percentage uptake, baseline fT4 and patient age were compared according to treatment response. RESULTS: Our cohort included 111 patients, 95 (86%) females and 16 (14%) males, with a mean age of 41.9 years. Treatment was successful after the first dose in 89.2% of cases (27.0% euthyroid; 62.2% hypothyroid), with 10.8% requiring a second dose, and only a single patient who remained hyperthyroid after that second empiric dose. Statistical analysis demonstrated that a high percentage thyroid uptake was associated with treatment failure, whereas a low percent thyroid uptake was associated with a good treatment response (P=0.0048). We found no significant difference in FT4 levels or age, between hyperthyroid and non-hyperthyroid (euthyroid or hypothyroid) groups post initial RAI therapy (P=0.5 and P=0.96, respectively). CONCLUSION: The use of a low fixed/empiric radioiodine activity for hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease performed well in our setting with a nearly 90% response rate achieved after a single dose of 10mCi. Justification for higher activity should be specified, and this method of determining the optimal dose of RAI therapy may be beneficial in resource constrained settings with high patient volumes.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Hyperthyroidism, a prevalent endocrine disorder, disrupts metabolic balance and cardiovascular health, affecting millions globally. Radioactive iodine (RAI), a treatment for hyperthyroidism, employs high-energy beta particles to reduce thyroid tissue, lowering volume and hormone levels. This study utilizes bibliometric analysis to outline RAI's evolution and identify hotspots in hyperthyroidism treatment. METHODS: A total of 2904 articles and reviews published between 1981 and 2023 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection using the research strategy. Bibliometric analyses, employing VOSviewer and CiteSpace, were performed to visualize the cooperation network, evolution, and hot topics. RESULTS: Annual publications rose in waves, 2904 papers from 2564 institutions, and 84 countries. The USA led, contributing the largest share, with the journal Thyroid dominating publication. The University of Pisa contributed the most articles. Co-occurrence analysis classified keywords into five clusters: treatment mechanism, safety, effectiveness assessment, individualized radioactive dosage, and management. The development of RAI therapy for hyperthyroidism can be divided into three stages: safety and efficacy assessment, personalized treatment plans, and treatment of drug-resistant and surgery-resistant hyperthyroidism. CONCLUSION: Attention to RAI in hyperthyroidism should be significantly increased. It is necessary to establish collaborations between authors, countries, and institutions to promote the development of this field. Recent research has focused on personalized radioactive dosage formulation and follow-up. Future studies are likely to concentrate on drug-resistant and surgery-resistant hyperthyroidism, which is also worthy of investigation. These findings provide a new perspective on the study of RAI in hyperthyroidism, potentially contributing to the improvement of the quality of life for patients with hyperthyroidism.",
