      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is a risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) by impairing normal vascular function. Natural products are gaining momentum in the clinical setting due to their high efficacy and low toxicity. Caralluma fimbriata extract (CFE) has been shown to control appetite and promote weight loss; however, its effect on vascular function remains poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the effect that CFE had on weight loss and vascular function in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce obesity, comparing this effect to that of lorcaserin (LOR) (an anti-obesity pharmaceutical) treatment. METHODS: C57BL/6J male mice (n = 80) were fed a 16-week HFD to induce obesity prior to being treated with CFE and LOR as standalone treatments or in conjunction. Body composition data, such as weight gain and fat mass content were measured, isometric tension analyses were performed on isolated abdominal aortic rings to determine relaxation responses to acetylcholine, and immunohistochemistry studies were utilized to determine the expression profiles on endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and cell stress markers (nitrotyrosine (NT) and 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78)) in the endothelial, medial and adventitial layers of aortic rings. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that CFE and CFE + LOR treatments significantly reduced weight gain (17%; 24%) and fat mass deposition (14%; 16%). A HFD markedly reduced acetylcholine-mediated relaxation (p < 0.05, p < 0.0001) and eNOS expression (p < 0.0001, p < 0.01) and significantly increased NT (p < 0.05, p < 0.0001) and GRP78 (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.001). Obese mice treated with CFE exhibited significantly improved ACh-induced relaxation responses, increased eNOS (p < 0.05, p < 0.01) and reduced NT (p < 0.01) and GRP78 (p < 0.05, p < 0.01) expression. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, CFE alone or in combination with LOR could serve as an alternative strategy for preventing obesity-related cardiovascular diseases.",

METHODS: Forty rats were divided into five groups: control (C), treated with CFE, treated with HFD, HFD treated with CFE, and HFD treated with metformin (Met). RESULTS: CFE treatment significantly (p < .001) attenuated HFD-induced increase in cardiac lipids such as total lipids, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and free fatty acids and decreased phospholipids accompanied by increasing in lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation. Furthermore, significant reduction in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, creatine kinase and aldose reductase and sorbitol dehydrogenase was also observed in HFD fed rats. These changes were alleviated by CFE. Moreover, the histopathological observations of heart are also in agreement with the biochemical findings. CONCLUSION: The present study confirmed that CFE could be used as adjuvant therapy for preventing or managing high fat diet induced cardiac damage.",

      "abstract": "This paper reports on the successful management of hyperphagia (exaggerated hunger) in a 14yr-old female with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). This child was diagnosed with PWS, (maternal uniparental disomy) at 18 months due to developmental delay, hypertonia, weight gain and extreme eating behaviour. Treatment of a supplement for appetite suppression commenced at 2 years of age. This single-case records ingestion of an Indian cactus succulent Caralluma fimbriata extract (CFE) over 12 years, resulting in anecdotal satiety, free access to food and management of weight within normal range. CFE was administered in a drink daily and dose was slowly escalated by observation for appetite suppression. Rigorous testing determined blood count, vitamins, key minerals, HbA1c, IGF-1 and function of the liver and thyroid all within normal range. The report suggests a strategy for early intervention against hyperphagia and obesity in PWS. This case was the instigator of the successful Australian PWS/CFE pilot and though anecdotal, the adolescent continues to ingest CFE followed by paediatricians at the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Future clinical trials are worth considering, to determine an appropriate dose for individuals with PWS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study investigated the efficacy of a succulent, Caralluma fimbriata extract (CFE) in reducing anxiety and stress in healthy adults. METHODS: An 8 week double-blind randomised clinical trial, in which 97 adults self-reporting mild to moderate anxiety were given 500 mg b.d. CFE (n = 49), or 500 mg b.d. placebo (n = 48). Anxiety and stress were measured at baseline, week 4, and week 8 to investigate the timing of treatment effect using the GAD-7, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and salivary cortisol. Data were analysed using mixed ANOVAs on SPSS v.24. RESULTS: Results indicated a significant reduction in anxiety and stress in both groups at week 4 and week 8. The reduction in the CFE group was significantly greater (p < .05) than in the placebo group on the GAD-7 and PSS at week 4 and week 8, and in Negative affect at week 4. Improvement in Positive affect was greater in the CFE group than in the placebo group at week 8. Cortisol analysis indicated that CFE may act through the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, showing statistically significant changes in males, but not in females. LIMITATIONS: Self-reported instruments involve subjective interpretation thus salivary cortisol was employed as a more objective measure. The study would benefit from a larger sample and longer trial, and the inclusion of a wait-list group to allow comparison between treatment and no treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that CFE is superior to placebo in reducing subclinical anxiety and stress over 8 weeks.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), nonprotein coding small nucleolar (sno) RNAs are involved in the paternally deleted region of chromosome 15q11.2-q13, which is believed to cause the hyperphagic phenotype of PWS. Central to this is SnoRNA116. The supplement Caralluma fimbriata extract (CFE) has been shown to decrease appetite behavior in some individuals with PWS. We therefore investigated the mechanism underpinning the effect of CFE on food intake in the Snord116del mouse. Experiments utilized appetite stimulants which included a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 2c receptor antagonist (SB242084), as the 5-HT2cR is implicated in central signaling of satiety. METHODS: After 9-week chronic CFE treatment (33 mg or 100 mg kg-1  day-1 ) or placebo, the 14-week-old Snord116del (SNO) and wild-type mice (n = 72) were rotated through intraperitoneal injections of (a) isotonic saline; (b) 400 mg/kg of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) (glucose deprivation); (c) 100 mglkg beta-mercaptoacetate (MA), fatty acid signaling; and (d) SB242084 (a selective 5HT2cR antagonist), with 5 days between reagents. Assessments of food intake were from baseline to 4 hr, followed by immunohistochemistry of neural activity utilizing c-Fos, neuropeptide Y, and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone within hypothalamic appetite pathways. RESULTS: Caralluma fimbriata extract administration decreased food intake more strongly in the SNO100CFE group with significantly stimulated food intake demonstrated during coadministration with SB242084. Though stimulatory deprivation was expected to stimulate food intake, 2DG and MA resulted in lower intake in the snord116del mice compared to the WT animals (p = <0.001). Immunohistochemical mapping of hypothalamic neural activity was consistent with the behavioral studies. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies a role for the 5-HT2cR in CFE-induced appetite suppression and significant stimulatory feeding disruptions in the snord116del mouse model.",

After 90 days, oxidative stress markers in the pancreas including reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid oxidation (LO), protein oxidation (PO), and activities of antioxidant and polyol pathway enzymes, aldose reductase (AR) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) were assayed and tissue histology was examined. Establishment of oxidative stress in high fat diet fed rats was verified by elevated LO and PO, decreased GSH, decreased activities of antioxidants and increased activities of polyol pathway enzymes. Oxidative stress was prevented in HFD + CFE and HFD + Met groups. Group C + CFE exhibited improved antioxidant status compared to group C.

Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups: control (C), control treated with CFE (C + CFE), high-fat diet fed (HFD), high-fat diet fed treated with CFE (HFD + CFE), and high-fat diet fed treated with metformin (HFD + metformin). CFE was orally administered (200 mg/kg body weight) to Groups C + CFE and HFD + CFE rats for 90 days. Renal functional markers such as, urea, uric acid, and creatinine levels in plasma were quantified during the experimental period. At the end of the experimental period, activities of transaminases and oxidative stress markers, i.e., reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and activities of antioxidant enzymes were assayed in renal tissue. Coadministration of CFE along with HF-diet in Group HFD + CFE prevented the rise in the levels of plasma urea, uric acid, and creatinine, and elevated activities of renal transaminases with decreased protein content of Group HFD (p < 0.05). Establishment of oxidative stress in Group HFD, as evident from elevated lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation levels with depleted levels of GSH, and decreased activities of GSH dependent and independent antioxidant enzymes, was prevented in Groups HFD + CFE and HFD + metformin rats. Further, there were no deviations in the studied parameters but there was improved antioxidant status of Group C + CFE from Group C which revealed the nontoxic nature of CFE even under chronic treatment. Thus, CFE treatment effectively alleviated the HF-diet induced renal damage. Hence, this plant could be used as an adjuvant therapy for the prevention and/or management of HF-diet induced renal damage.",

PWS develops hyperphagia, which when left unmanaged, leads to an excessive ingestion of food. To date there is inadequate pharmacological treatment or supplementation for modification of the PWS hyperphagia and/or the associated behaviors. Therefore, the best practice is familial supervision and restriction of diet and environment. AIM: We aimed to determine if the natural supplement of Caralluma fimbriata extract (CFE) could attenuate hyperphagia or the associated appetite behaviors in children and adolescents with PWS over the 4-week pilot trial period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized crossover trial over a 10-week period to investigate the effects of CFE on hunger control, in a cohort of children and adolescents with confirmed PWS (n =15, mean age 9.27 ± 3.16 years, body weight 43.98 ± 23.99 kg). Participants from Australia and New Zealand ingested CFE or a placebo of maltodextrin/cabbage leaf over a 4-week period, with a 2-week washout before the crossover to the other treatment. Weekly comparisons in appetite behavior, severity, and drive were recorded by parents, as scaled time-point measures on a hyperphagia questionnaire validated for PWS. RESULTS: CFE administration was found to induce a significant accumulative easing of hyperphagia (P = 0.05), with decreases evident in one-third of the participants. Furthermore due to CFE supplementation, a significant decrease (P ≤ 0.05) was recorded in the category of behavior and a decrease in hyperphagia (n = 8, P = 0.009) was observed at the highest dose 1,000 mg/day (recommended adult dose). There were no reported adverse effects at any dose. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that an extract of the Indian cactus succulent Caralluma fimbriata eases hyperphagic appetite behavior within a cohort of children and adolescents (n = 15) with PWS without notable adverse effects. The outcomes of this study will have a potential positive impact on PWS management."

      "abstract": "AIM: The aim of the following study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Caralluma fimbriata extract (CFE) in overweight and obese individuals in a prospective, randomized, placebo controlled trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Commercially available CFE was assessed in overweight and obese individuals. A total of 89 patients were randomized into a treatment group (n = 47) and placebo group (n = 42) to receive either CFE in the form capsules/oral 500 mg b.d. for 12 weeks or matching placebo in similar way. Patients were evaluated clinically and biochemically at 4, 8 and 12 weeks for anthropometric measurements, appetite, biochemical investigations and other safety parameters. RESULTS: At the end of study period both CFE and placebo for 12 weeks caused only numerical reduction in weight, body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference and waist hip ratio in overweight and obese individuals. However, these parameters failed to attain significant statistical levels (P ≥ 0.05). CFE and placebo both failed to elucidate any modification of the appetite. There were no significant changes in the biochemical and clinical parameters in both the test and placebo group. However, CFE was well-tolerated and adverse events noted were mild and transient in nature. CONCLUSION: A commercially available extract of CFE in an oral dose of 1 g/day claimed to have anti-obesity effect failed to yield any positive results on anthropometry and appetite in overweight and obese individuals beyond placebo. There were also no significant differences in the clinical and biochemical parameters. However, CFE was well tolerated. Thereby, underscoring the need to carry more research before CFE is recommended as an anti-obesity drug."

      "abstract": "The main aim of this study was to investigate the beneficial effects of hydro-alcoholic extract of Caralluma fimbriata (CFE) on the effects of high-fat diet feeding on insulin resistance and oxidative stress in Wistar rats. High-fat diet (60% of fat) and CFE (200 mg/kg body weight/day) were given concurrently to the rats for a period of 90 days. Feeding with high-fat diet resulted in the development of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia and impaired insulin sensitivity (P < 0.05). Administration of CFE to high-fat diet-fed rats for 90 days resulted in a significant improvement in plasma glucose, insulin, leptin, and triglycerides. Regarding liver antioxidant status, high-fat fed rats showed higher levels of lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and lower GSH levels and lower activities of enzymatic antioxidants, while CFE treatment prevented all these observed abnormalities. In conclusion, intake of CFE may be beneficial for the suppression of high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance and oxidative stress.",

No evidence of in vitro mutagenicity or clastogenicity surfaced in the in vitro studies at concentrations up to 5000 μg of extract/plate (Ames test) or 5000 μg of extract/mL (chromosomal aberration test). No deaths or treatment-related toxicity were seen in the 6-month chronic oral toxicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats conducted at 3 doses (100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg body weight (bw)/d). The no observed effect level for CFE in this study was considered to be 1000 mg/kg bw/d. A prenatal developmental toxicity study conducted at 3 doses (250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg bw/d) in female Sprague-Dawley rats resulted in no treatment-related external, visceral, or skeletal fetal abnormalities, and no treatment-related maternal or pregnancy alterations were seen at and up to the maximum dose tested.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Central obesity is a key component of metabolic syndrome and it is often associated with other risk factors such as dyslipidemia, elevated plasma glucose levels and elevated blood pressure (BP). In this pilot study, the effect of Caralluma fimbriata (an edible succulent) extract in combination with controlled dietary intake and physical activity on these risk factors was assessed in overweight and obese Australian subjects. DESIGN: This was a randomised, double blind placebo controlled clinical trial. Forty-three adults aged 29-59 years were recruited. The eligibility criteria included a Body Mass Index (BMI) >25 kg/m(2), or a waist circumference >94 cm (male), >80 cm (female). Thirty-three participants completed the 12-week study at Victoria University Nutritional Therapy Clinic. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups. C. fimbriata extract and placebo were orally administered as 500 mg capsules twice daily (1 g/day) and dietary intake and exercise were monitored weekly. RESULTS: The results of thirty-three participants (experimental group, n = 17; placebo group n = 16) were analysed. The primary outcome measure was the decline in waist circumference. By week 9, the experimental group had lost 5.7 cm, compared to only 2.8 cm loss in the placebo group (Difference: -2.890; 95% CI; -5.802 to 0.023). Post intervention, the experimental group had lost 6.5 cm compared to 2.6 cm loss in the placebo group (Difference: -3.847; 95% CI; -7.466 to 0.228). Waist to hip ratio (WHR) also improved significantly after 12 weeks intervention in the experimental group, with a total reduction of 0.03 being recorded compared to 0.01 increase in the placebo group (Difference: -0.033; 95% CI; -0.064 to -0.002). There was also a significant decline in the palatability (visual appeal, smell, taste) of the test meal and sodium intake in the experimental group at week 12 (p < 0.05). In addition a significant reduction in body weight, BMI, hip circumference, systolic BP, HR, triglyceride levels, total fat and saturated fat intake within both groups was observed following the intervention period (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Supplementation with C. fimbriata extract whilst controlling overall dietary intake and physical activity may potentially play a role in curbing central obesity, the key component of metabolic syndrome. Controlling dietary intake and exercise improved body weight and favourably influenced the metabolic risk profile.",

The Diet-Induced Obesity (DIO) rat model was used to investigate CFE's anorexigenic effects. Rats were randomly divided into three groups: (i) untreated control (C), (ii) control for cafeteria diet (CA), and (iii) cafeteria diet fed + CFE treated. Rats in the test group received cafeteria diet and CFE from day one onwards. CFE was administered by gavage at three doses (25, 50, 100 mg/Kg BW per day) for 90 days. The antiobesogenic effects of CFE were evaluated by monitoring changes in feed intake, body weight, serum lipid and hormonal (leptin) profiles, fat pads, and liver weight. Antiatherosclerotic effects were measured by histology. CFE induced significant and dose-dependent inhibition of food intake, with dose-related prevention of gains in body weight, liver weight, and fat pad mass. Alterations in serum lipid profiles associated with weight gain were similarly inhibited, as were the typical increases in serum leptin levels. These data substantiate CFE's reported anorexigenic effects. CFE treatment also conferred protection against atherogenesis. We conclude that CFE possesses antiobesogenic and antiatherosclerotic properties."

The effect of Caralluma extract was assessed in overweight individuals by a placebo controlled randomized trial. Fifty adult men and women (25-60 years) with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 25 kg/m2 were randomly assigned into a placebo or experimental group; the latter received 1 g of Caralluma extract per day for 60 days. All subjects were given standard advice regarding a weight reducing diet and physical activity. At the end of 30 and 60 days of intervention, blood glucose and lipids, anthropometric measurements, dietary intake and assessment of appetite was performed. Waist circumference and hunger levels over the observation period showed a significant decline in the experimental group when compared to the placebo group. While there was a trend towards a greater decrease in body weight, body mass index, hip circumference, body fat and energy intake between assessment time points in the experimental group, these were not significantly different between experimental and placebo groups. Caralluma extract appears to suppress appetite, and reduce waist circumference when compared to placebo over a 2 month period.",
