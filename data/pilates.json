      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The practice of the Pilates method (PM) improves sleep quality, as well as it could decrease low back pain. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Pilates on the quality of life (QoL) of pregnant women during pregnancy. METHODS: A systematic review examining perceived QoL, pain, and mental health in pregnant women practising the PM was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 criteria in the Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Trip Database electronic databases, including studies published between January 2013 and February 2024. Methodological quality was assessed using the critical appraisal tool for studies of the Joanna Briggs Institute. RESULTS: Ten publications addressing the key words on the topic were included involving a total of 499 pregnant women, of which 268 had practiced Pilates and 231 had received routine care. The results showed that, in 2 of the studies, pregnant women who had practised the PM during pregnancy showed an improvement in perceived QoL (chi-squared value = 5.597, P = .018), sleep quality (P = .018) and physical mobility (P = .040). Lumbopelvic pain (LBPP) was reduced in the group of pregnant women in eight of these studies (with values of P < .001 and P < .05), and 1 study reported no significant differences among these variables. In terms of mental health, 2 studies reported a decrease in anxiety (P < .05 and P = .009) and 1 study indicated lower depression levels (scores of control group from a mean of 6.19 to 7.54, and the intervention group from a mean of 8.61 to 4.59). CONCLUSION: The PM shows benefits in improving the QoL of pregnant women who practise it during pregnancy. Other indicators such as LBPP and mental health also benefit from Pilates. The practice of physical activity, supervised by nurses and midwives, can lead to an improvement in pregnant women's perception of their own health and QoL. REPORTING METHOD: PRISMA Declaration.

METHOD: 35 individuals with Parkinson's disease were randomized into three groups: functional training, Mat Pilates, and control group, along with 11 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals for the healthy reference group. The exercise groups received twice-weekly 60-min sessions for 12 wk. The control group and healthy reference group maintained routine activities and also received educational lectures during the 12-wk period. Outcome measures included cognition (MoCA), depressive symptoms (BDI), anxiety (BAI), mood (BRUMS), and aging perspective (Sheppard Inventory). RESULTS: Short-term effects were observed for the functional training group in the short term for depressive symptoms (p = 0.010) and cognition (p = 0.040), and in the short and long term for anxiety (p = 0.007) and happiness (aging perspective) (p = 0.002). For the Mat Pilates group, effects were observed in cognition (p = 0.048) and confusion (p = 0.049) in the short term, and in depressive symptoms (p < 0.001), anxiety (p = 0.033), happiness (p < 0.001), and loneliness (aging perspective) (p = 0.017) in the short and long term. The control group showed worsening in depressive symptoms (p = 0.030) and confusion (p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: Mat Pilates and functional training classes were effective in improving cognition, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and happiness. The control group and healthy reference group did not show significant effects in most studied variables. Both types of exercise can be recommended by professionals working with people with Parkinson's disease. REGISTRATION: ReBEC - RBR-6ckggn."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The physiologic changes associated with pregnancy often result in pain, impacting the quality of life. Therefore, it is crucial to prevent and manage this pain through appropriate health care, including guidance on physical exercise. One of the currently recommended interventions is the Pilates method. However, health care professionals caring for pregnant women must have the necessary knowledge, tools, and resources to advise their patients. This study aimed to examine the impact of Pilates method practice on pregnancy-related pain. METHODS: A quasiexperimental study was conducted in multiple primary care centers between November 2018 and December 2019. Participants (n = 107) self-selected to receive a Pilates program (experimental group; n = 38) or their usual care (control group; n = 69). The presence or absence of pelvic, dorsal, and abdominal pain was evaluated as an outcome measure. The results were compared after the intervention, using descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate statistics. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NTC04431102). RESULTS: Pilates method practice was associated with decreased presence of pelvic pain (odds ratio [OR], 2.73; 95% CI, 1.18-4.51; P = .02) and abdominal pain (OR, 5.24; 95% CI, 2.23-12.35; P < .001). No statistically significant difference was found for the presence of dorsal pain. DISCUSSION: Pilates appears to be a promising tool for enhancing well-being during pregnancy by reducing pelvic and abdominal pain. It would be beneficial to involve other professionals trained in the Pilates method or, in the future, to train midwives to implement this intervention in birth and parenting programs within primary care."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Subacute low back pain (LBP) is a critical phase that can determine long-term patient outcomes. Exercise therapy, including Pilates, is widely used to manage LBP, but its effectiveness in the subacute phase remains underexplored. This randomized controlled trial aims to compare the effects of an 8-week Pilates-based intervention versus a home exercise program on pain intensity, functional disability, and quality of life in patients with subacute LBP. METHODS: Sixty-six participants with subacute LBP were randomized into two groups: a supervised Pilates group and a home exercise group. Pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale), functional disability (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire), and quality of life (Short Form-36) were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Both groups exhibited significant improvements in all outcome measures (p < 0.001). However, the Pilates group showed superior reductions in pain intensity (p = 0.010 post-treatment, p = 0.002 at follow-up) and functional disability (p = 0.009 and p = 0.002). Additionally, quality of life scores improved more significantly in the Pilates group, particularly in physical function (p = 0.031 and p = 0.025) and general health (p = 0.005 and p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Pilates-based rehabilitation was more effective than a home exercise program in improving pain, disability, and quality of life in patients with subacute LBP. These findings support the inclusion of Pilates in early-stage rehabilitation to prevent chronicity. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials Number: NCT06699511."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE: Numerous studies report the impact of daily exercise on many aspects of female sexual dysfunction (FSD). However, limited studies are investigating the effect of pilates on FSD. The primary aim of this study was to prospectively examine the effect of Pilates on female sexual function using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaires. METHODS: Ninety-three sexually active premenopausal women were enrolled in the study. The study group was asked to complete FSFI, ASEX, and BDI questionnaires before and after a 12-week Pilates exercise program. The control group was asked to complete FSFI, BDI, and ASEX questionnaires and continue their daily routine for 12 weeks. At the end of 12 weeks, the individuals were asked to complete the same questionnaires again. RESULTS: FSFI, ASEX and BDI scores were compared before and after 12 weeks of Pilates exercise, and a statistically significant improvement was observed in all 3 questionnaire composite scores (p < 0.01). When the study and control groups were compared after 12 weeks, a statistically significant difference was observed between the study and control groups in FSFI scores (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Present study has demonstrated undeniable improvements in ASEX, BDI, and all domains of FSFI scores after a 12-week Pilates exercise program in women with FSD. Pilates exercise may be a supportive intervention for the treatment of FSD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Popular programs to combat the increased rates of falls and improve overall balance and strength in the aging population are limited by accessibility or focus on distal movements, thereby limiting gains from the programs. The use of an age-appropriate, community-based Pilates program focusing on core strengthening for improved balance is proposed. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to test the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of a mat-based, core strengthening Pilates program (aka Pilates Gold). The secondary objective was to investigate changes in balance and core strength for participating seniors. DESIGN: Prospective pre-post, observational study. SETTING: Classes were on site at two retirement community centers. PARTICIPANTS: Males and females (65 years old and older) were recruited from two different senior community centers on a first-come first-serve basis. Participants had to be (1) English speaking, (2) an existing resident at one of the retirement communities, and (3) considered healthy by common standards. INTERVENTIONS: Mat-based Pilates program for 8 consecutive weeks. Movement difficulty and pace were slowly increased over the 8-week program, with a maximum of 17 different movements. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes for feasibility of the Pilates program were the Acceptability of Intervention Measure, Intervention Appropriateness Measure, and Feasibility of Intervention Measure. Secondary outcomes included the Sitting-Rising test, Activities Balance Confidence, and Patient Global Impression of Change. RESULTS: The Pilates program was deemed appropriate, acceptable, and feasible by >80% of senior participants. Over 80% also reported some level of change in overall health due to the program. No significant differences were observed in balance outcomes, although there were individual improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Community-based Pilates programs are highly desired, feasible, and acceptable. These results justify further studies, of longer training periods and perhaps increasing difficult levels, to determine if core strengthening mat-based Pilates is truly capable of improving balance, strength, and fall risks in seniors."

      "abstract": "QUESTION: In people with chronic non-specific low back pain, what is the effect of high-intensity Pilates exercise compared with low-intensity Pilates exercise on pain, disability, patient-specific function, kinesiophobia and isometric hip strength? DESIGN: Randomised trial with concealed allocation, blinded assessors and intention-to-treat analysis. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and sixty-eight people with chronic non-specific low back pain and aged between 18 and 60 years. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were allocated to undertake 1-hour sessions of clinical Pilates at either high-intensity or low-intensity, twice per week for 6 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the numerical pain scale and the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire at the end of the 6-week intervention period. The secondary outcomes were the Patient-Specific Functional Scale, the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia and isometric hip strength at 6 weeks. Pain and disability were also re-measured 6 and 12 months after the intervention. RESULTS: The two Pilates regimens had negligible differences in effects on all outcomes at the end of the intervention period. At 6 and 12 months, the between-group differences in pain intensity were still negligible but the confidence intervals around those estimates spanned from around no effect to a worthwhile benefit (≥ 1.4) from low-intensity Pilates compared with high-intensity Pilates: 6-month MD 0.6 (95% CI -0.2 to 1.4) and 12-month MD 0.8 (95% CI 0.0 to 1.6). The effect on disability remained negligible at 6 and 12 months. Adverse events were less common in the low-intensity group: absolute risk reduction 0.20 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.31). CONCLUSION: High-intensity and low-intensity Pilates had very similar effects on pain, disability and other outcomes in people with chronic non-specific low back pain. Physiotherapists should endorse low-intensity Pilates exercises for managing chronic non-specific low back pain because the effects on most outcomes are very similar to high-intensity Pilates exercise but there are fewer side effects.

This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of online Pilates training on cognitive functions and the DT performance of balance, walking, and functional mobility in PwMS. METHOD: In this randomized controlled trial, forty-six PwMS were recruited and randomly allocated into two groups. The Online Pilates group (OPG) received Pilates training via videoconferences three days per week during six weeks at home. The control group (CG) was a waitlist with no Pilates treatment. Cognitive Functions were assessed with Montreal Cognitive Asssessment (MoCA), The Trail Making Test (TMT), and The Stroop Test (ST). DT performance was assessed with mental tracking and verbal fluency during postural stability (PS), walking, and functional mobility. RESULTS: At the end of six weeks, the interaction effects (time × group) revealed significant differences for MoCA (p = 0.024), TMT-B (p = 0.012), ST (p ≤ 0.012), PS-with mental tracking (p = 0.004), PS-with verbal fluency (p = 0.003), cadence-with mental tracking (p = 0.048), and functional mobility-with mental tracking (p = 0.043) in favor of the OPG. Additionally, MoCA, TMT, ST, and DT performance during balance and functional mobility significantly improved in after six-week online Pilates training, but did not in CG. CONCLUSION: Pilates training via videoconference was effective in the improvement of cognitive functions and DT performance in PwMS. Online Pilates may be considered for improving cognitive impairments and DT performances in PwMS with barriers to accessing clinics. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT06462339."

Nonetheless, regular physical exercise appears to ameliorate breast cancer survivor (BCS) QoL components. PURPOSE: to analyze the effect of 24 weeks of mat Pilates (3 times/week, 60 min session) in BCS receiving hormone therapy on QoL components. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 43 participants were randomized according to hormone therapy (Tamoxifen (TMX) or Aromatase Inhibitors (AIs)) in the Pilates group (PG) and control group (CG). The QoL data was collected through SF-36, EORT-30, and 23 questionnaires. The evaluations occurred at baseline (T1), at week 12 (T2), and week 24 (T3) of the intervention. The generalized estimating equations model was used with the Bonferroni post hoc test (p < 0.05). RESULTS: The SF-36 showed that CG improved physical limitations at T2 compared to T1 (p = 0.032). The Pilates group enhanced emotional aspects compared to CG at T3 (0.009), social aspects at T3 compared to its baseline (p = 0.023), and mental health at T3 compared to CG (p = 0.026). The specific breast cancer questionnaires (EORT-30 and 23) did not show differences throughout the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Only the SF-36 showed enhancement for PG QoL components. The EORT-30 and 23 domains are directly related to the side effect treatments, which could influence the outcomes.",

DESIGN: A parallel-group, randomized controlled trial (RCT). SETTING: XXX Medical Center, XXX, and XXX Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Center, Nicosia. PARTICIPANTS: 32 pwPD with Hoehn&Yahr stages 2-3 were randomly assigned to the Parkinsonpilates Group (PP) and the Conventional Physiotherapy (CP) Group. INTERVENTIONS: Both groups received 60 min of training, twice a week, and a home physiotherapy program 4 times a week, for 12 weeks. The intervention group received PP, while the CP group received general physiotherapy training for PD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were untimed Gait and Balance Scale, Cadence, and Nelson Foot Reaction Test scores. The secondary outcomes were The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III subscales, Timed Up and Go Test, Functional Reach Test, and Berg Balance Scale. Outcomes were convened 4 times: pre-test, 6. weeks, post-treatment, and after 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: At post-test, gait and balance, reaction time, functional mobility, static and dynamic balance showed a significant improvement in PP compared to CP, and the motor examination was similar(p > .05). In addition to these results at follow-up, functional mobility was similar(p > .05) and cadence(p < .05) showed a significant improvement in PP. In addition, according to pairwise comparisons, the PP showed a significant improvement in cadence and reaction time in all 4 measures compared to CP. CONCLUSIONS: More studies are needed to clarify the effects of the program we developed for PD. It should not be ignored that our protocol can be improved again according to the suggestions of future studies.",

However, movement performance changes such as single-leg squat have not been studied. It is also unclear if simple movement-specific Pilates exercises lead to changes in lower back or hamstrings flexibility. This study investigated the immediate changes in postural sway of single-leg squat, hamstrings flexibility and lumbar flexion flexibility after a brief session of Clinical Pilates exercises in adults with non-specific chronic low back pain. METHODS: Forty adults with chronic low back pain were assessed on single-leg squat postural sway, hamstrings flexibility and lumbar flexion flexibility. Participants were then assessed with Clinical Pilates assessment to identify movements that are easy to do and pain-free. One to four Pilates exercises based on the identified movements were then prescribed as the intervention. A post-intervention assessment concluded the session. Repeated measures statistical tests were used to study changes over time and between the problem and non-problem sides for postural sway parameters and hamstrings flexibility. A paired sample t-test was used to evaluate lumbar flexion flexibility changes. RESULTS: The participants showed statistically significant improvements on the problem side in three postural sway variables - vertical force variance, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.39, terminal knee flexion angle, p = 0.004, η2 = 0.19, and squat duration, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.29. They also improved their hamstrings flexibility, p = 0.004, η2 = 0.2, and lumbar flexion flexibility, mean difference = 0.64 cm [95 % CI: 0.49, 0.79] cm, p < 0.001. SIGNIFICANCE: A brief session of Clinical Pilates exercises enabled individuals with chronic low back pain to squat deeper and faster while maintaining the same level of postural stability."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pilates is a popular type of exercise, aimed at improving core muscle strength and endurance, core stability, and joint flexibility through a variety of whole-body exercises. Research has shown that Pilates improves body composition, muscle endurance, and joint flexibility. Adequate protein intake is a key factor in supporting the adaptive response of skeletal muscle to exercise training. However, whether protein supplementation augments the adaptations to Pilates training remains unknown. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of protein supplementation during Pilates training on body composition, core muscle endurance, and joint flexibility in trained women. METHODS: Nineteen Pilates-trained women (31 ± 9 y) performed 10 weeks of Pilates training using the Reformer and Cadillac apparatuses, at least 2 times per week. Participants were randomly allocated to either a placebo (n = 10) or protein supplementation group (n = 9) in a quadruple-blind (participants, intervention providers, investigators, and outcome assessors) design. Participants received 0.6 g of maltodextrin or whey protein per kg body weight daily, respectively. Habitual dietary intake was monitored throughout the study. Before and after the intervention, anthropometric measures (body weight, body mass index, waist and hip circumferences), body composition [through full-scan dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)], core muscle endurance (through the McGill's torso muscular endurance test battery), and joint flexibility (through the sit-and-reach test) were assessed. Data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA (supplement × time) with repeated measures on time. Common DXA and BIA variables (whole-body fat and lean mass) were compared through paired Student's t tests and subjected to Pearson's correlation analysis. The level of statistical significance was set at α = 0.05. RESULTS: Participants received, on average, 1.3 g protein/kg body weight/day from their habitual diet. After 10 weeks of Pilates training and regardless of supplementation, body fat (assessed by BIA) and hip circumference decreased; lean mass, total water, and extracellular water (by BIA) increased; and arm lean mass, trunk bone mineral content, and trunk bone area (by DXA) increased (all p < 0.05). The common BIA and DXA variables were highly correlated (r > 0.78, p < 0.001) and did not differ pre-intervention (p > 0.1), although they differed post-intervention (p < 0.001), with BIA overestimating lean mass compared with DXA. Core muscle endurance and joint flexibility increased with training (p < 0.05), with no effect of supplementation. CONCLUSION: Ten weeks of Pilates training improved core muscle endurance, joint flexibility, and aspects of body composition in healthy trained women, but these adaptations were not enhanced by daily supplementation with 0.6 g of protein per kilogram body weight.",

After being invited, 26 sedentary women aged between 20 and 54 voluntarily agreed to participate in the study. The sample was obtained through convenience sampling, and the participants chose either PIL or WBHIIT, which resulted in 13 participants in each group. Spinal posture was assessed pre- and post-intervention through videogrammetry during standing and walking. Markers were placed on the back, and the volunteers were instructed to remain in a standing position on a stationary treadmill for ten seconds. Subsequently, the treadmill was activated at a speed of 5 km/h. After one minute of walking, a complete gait cycle was recorded for analysis. The results showed no significant changes in spinal angles in static position between groups. However, in the walking position, there was a large-magnitude increase in the spinal range of motion (ROM) post-intervention (PIL Lumbar d = 1.8; PIL Thoracic d = 2.9; WBHIIT Lumbar d = 1.0; WBHIIT Thoracic d = 3.5) within groups in the sagittal plane. The adaptations promoted by these interventions in spinal ROM are important for reducing the risks of spinal stiffness and pain due to sedentary behaviour.",

This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of Pilates training combined with fascial massage as an intervention in office workers with UCS. Methods: 34 subjects were recruited and randomly divided into an experimental group (n = 17) and a control group (n = 17). The control group underwent 12 weeks of Pilates training, and the experimental group received 12 weeks of Pilates training combined with fascial massage. Body posture was assessed using the forward head angle (FHA) and forward shoulder angle (FSA), joint mobility was evaluated using cervical spine range of motion (ROM), muscle activity was assessed using surface electromyography (sEMG), and quality of life was evaluated using pain level (VAS) and cervical spine dysfunction index (NDI). Results: After 12 weeks of intervention, the FHA, FSA, VAS, and NDI of the experimental group were significantly lower than those of the pre-intervention group (p < 0.05) and significantly lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05); the extension and left-right rotation cervical spine ROM of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the pre-intervention group (p < 0.05) and significantly higher than those of the control group (p < 0.05); and sEMG indexes (mean power frequency and median frequency) of the upper trapezius and the pectoralis major in the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the pre-intervention group (p < 0.05) and significantly higher than the control group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Compared with Pilates training alone, Pilates training combined with fascial massage demonstrated a more significant effect in improving muscle activation, body posture, and pain and enhancing the quality of life for patients with UCS."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) has been recommended in multiple sclerosis (MS) to maintain good physical fitness and mental health, reduce the severity of symptoms and risk of relapse, and improve quality of life. Pilates has been suggested as an ideal PA to manage physical, cognitive, and psychological symptoms of MS and a useful method to maintain and improve balance and gait. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for a study that aims to evaluate the efficacy on the physical domain (specifically balance and gait) of a home-based, self-managed PA intervention delivered through the MS-FIT exergame (HELAGLOBE Società a responsabilità limitata). In addition, measures of cognitive performance, quality of life, and well-being will be considered. METHODS: This is a 2-arm, multicenter, randomized controlled trial with 3 assessment points (baseline, 12 weeks postintervention, and 6 weeks follow-up). People with MS with mild disability, low risk of falling, preserved cognitive functions, and low anxiety and depression are potential eligible participants. The experimental group (MS-FIT) will self-administer the MS-FIT exergame at home in addition to their leisure-time physical activities. MS-FIT is an internet- and Pilates-based tool that uses the Microsoft Kinect Sensor V2. Participants in the control group will only have access to their leisure-time physical activities. Participants in the MS-FIT group will train at home with MS-FIT for 12 weeks and will be required to perform the exercises for a total of 30 minutes/day for at least 3 days/week. The primary outcome is the Timed Up and Go, a test designed to assess walking. We will also administer additional tests for motor function (visual analog scale 0-10, Timed 25-Foot Walk, Ambulation Index, 2-minute walk test, Twelve Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale, Nine-Hole Peg Test), cognition (Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis), fatigue (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale), quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54), well-being (Psychological Well-Being Scales), and PA (International Physical Activity Questionnaire and Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire). Acceptance and satisfaction with the intervention received (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire and an adapted version of the Tele-healthcare Satisfaction Questionnaire - Wearable Technology) and subjective impressions of changes in performance (Patients' Global Impression of Change) will also be assessed. RESULTS: Recruitment for the trial started on March 16, 2022, and the first participant was randomized the same day. Data analysis and results are expected to be published in 2025. CONCLUSIONS: Pilates has proven beneficial in several neurological diseases such as MS. With this study, we will provide evidence for the use in clinical practice of a digital tool for self-administered Pilates exercises at home as a complement to rehabilitation and for the continuity of care in MS.

Forty-four women were divided into single-condition (SINGLE; n = 20) and multiple-condition (MULTI; n = 24) groups. Both groups completed Mat Pilates three times per week for 12 weeks. Measurements of resting blood pressure, body composition, dietary intake, and blood markers were taken before and after the intervention. A Generalized Estimating Equation was used for hypothesis testing. MULTI presented higher body mass, BMI, fat mass, and waist circumference. Systolic blood pressure decreased more in SINGLE (-13 ± 15 mmHg) than in MULTI (-3 ± 16 mmHg, p interaction = 0.016 with diastolic reductions in both groups (SINGLE: -9 ± 12 mmHg; MULTI: -2 ± 11 mmHg, p interaction = 0.053). Triglycerides decreased only in SINGLE (-40 ± 98 mg/dL vs. +31 ± 70 mg/dL in MULTI, p interaction = 0.006), while no significant changes were observed in cholesterol levels. Adiponectin levels decreased in both groups (SINGLE: -1.5 ± 16.3; MULTI: -9.3 ± 12.4 vs. µg/dL, p time = 0.015). Glycated hemoglobin levels decreased over time in both groups (-0.3 ± 0.5% in SINGLE, -0.5 ± 0.6% in MULTI, p time < 0.001), with no significant changes in blood glucose. These findings suggest that Mat Pilates may be more effective in reducing cardiometabolic risk factors in women with a single condition compared to those with multiple conditions.",

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of Pilates exercises on IBS symptoms and severity, frequency of complete spontaneous bowel movements, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and body weight in women with IBS. METHODS: Sixty women with IBS, aged 20-45, completed this study. They were randomly assigned to two equal groups: a study group (n = 30) and a control group (n = 30). The study group received an 8-week Pilates exercise program (2 sessions per week) in addition to dietary advice, while the control group received dietary advice only. Inclusion criteria were women, IBS diagnosed based on Rome IV Diagnostic criteria, constipation-predominant IBS, and moderate to severe IBS. The outcome measures were the IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS), the frequency of complete spontaneous bowel movements, the modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS), hospital anxiety and depression (HADS) scale, and body weight (BW). RESULTS: The study group showed more significant improvements than the control group in total IBS-SSS score (Cohen d = 0.73, p < 0.001), frequency of complete spontaneous bowel movements (Cohen d = 0.50, p < 0.001), total MFIS score (Cohen d = 0.74, p < 0.001), anxiety (Cohen d = 0.56, p < 0.001), and depression (Cohen d = 0.64, p < 0.001). The study group also showed a significant reduction in body weight compared to baseline (p < 0.05). The control group showed significant improvements in all outcomes, except body weight, compared to baseline (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Pilates exercises, used in addition to dietary advice, may significantly improve IBS symptoms and severity, frequency of complete spontaneous bowel movements, and alleviate fatigue, anxiety, and depression moderately more than dietary advice alone in women with constipation-predominant IBS. Nevertheless, dietary advice alone may also significantly improve these outcomes in this cohort."

There were no differences for the sit-to-stand test, rising from the floor, dress and undress T-shirt, handgrip strength, and balance variables. CONCLUSION: Although the caffeine improved on the 10-m walk test and timed up and go test performance, healthy older adults were less responsive to caffeine after Pilates training only for performance on the timed up and go test."

Furthermore, the PG covered a greater distance compared to the SPEG in the 6-min walk test [95%CI (26.129-179.770); p < 0.010; d = 1.021] and exhibited a greater reduction in fatigue levels compared to the CG [95%CI (-2.352 to -0.162); p < 0.050; d = 0.919]. CONCLUSION: Eight weeks of Pilates Method improve the physical fitness and sleep quality of individuals with post-COVID-19 syndrome.",

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effects of a 12-week intervention with Mat Pilates in the short and long term, on lower limb and hand grip strength in people with Parkinson's. METHODS: The study included 23 people (61.7 ± 7.5 years) of both sexes, diagnosed with Parkinson's disease who were selected according to inclusion criteria and divided into intervention and control groups. RESULTS: The hand grip variable showed improvement in the intervention group intragroup only in the right hand (p = 0.003) in the post-intervention period. In the lower limb strength variable, there was significance in the extension of the left leg both in the intervention intragroup (p = 0.042), and in the control group (p = 0.001) the result in the flexion of the left leg in the intervention group (p = 0.032). The follow-up data showed significance in the strength of extension of the right leg in the intervention group (p = 0.049) and in the control group (p = 0.024) and in the extension of the left leg in the intervention group (p = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Mat Pilates classes for people with Parkinson's with mild and moderate degrees proved to be effective in the short term in the hand grip strength of the right hand, and in the extension and flexion of the left legs, and positive effects in the long term in the strength of extension of the right also left legs.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Restrictions in physical activity during Covid-19 pandemic had an impact on exercise activities on people with chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, for whom regular exercise is important for managing the disease. Therefore, alternative forms of exercise and rehabilitation were in high demand. The aim of pilot study was to verify the feasibility and potential effect of an online Pilates exercise programme for people with mild to moderate disability due to multiple sclerosis. METHODS: The exercise programme was scheduled for 12 weeks (2 times a week for 45 min of Pilates exercise combined with 30 min of aerobic activity based on participants preferences). The participants' adherence and the anthropometric parameters (weight, BMI, waist circumference) and the functional tests (Single-Leg Stance Test, Sit to Stand Test) were measured together with the patient reported outcomes to monitor patient's psychological well-being and exercise effect (General Self-efficacy Scale and Activity Balance Confidence Scale). RESULTS: The total number of 22 women with multiple sclerosis completed the pilot programme. The exercise program proved to be feasible. After 12 weeks of the online Pilates exercise programme significant improvements were found only in the parameter waist circumference (p = 0.03) and in the functional test Sit to Stance (p = 0.01). For the other tests, despite some improvement (self-efficacy and subjective perceived balance performance), there was no significant statistical difference. CONCLUSION: The online Pilates exercise programme supervised by a physiotherapist is feasible for people with mild to moderate neurological disability. It seems to have a positive impact on the anthropometric parameters, but this result needs to be evaluated on larger sample of patients.",

METHODS: Three children aged 8-12 years with GJH participated in an 8 week Physiotherapist-led Pilates Intervention within a single-case experimental design (multiple baseline design). Repeated measures were collected during baseline, intervention, withdrawal and follow-up, for: (i) pain, (ii) physical function as measured by muscle strength, postural control, fatigue and activity levels and (iii) HRQoL. RESULTS: Within the intervention phase, two children showed reduced fatigue and one child improved in muscle group strength of hip abduction (gluteus medius) and scapula adduction/rotation (rhomboideus major/minor) and HRQoL. No improvements were seen in pain or postural control. Within the early withdrawal phase all children showed improved strength for at least two muscle groups and one child showed reduced fatigue, pain (worst in last week) and improved postural control (functional reach lateral). CONCLUSIONS: Pilates may provide an effective intervention for children with GJH to reduce fatigue and improve muscle strength and HRQoL. Limited conclusions can be made regarding pain and postural control. Further research with a longer Pilates duration is needed to confirm the dose and benefits for this population.",

The aim of this randomized controlled and single-center study was to investigate the effect of reformer Pilates exercises on cognitive functions in sedentary women. METHODS: A total of 44 sedentary women aged between 24 and 50 were randomized into two groups. The reformer Pilates group received a 6-week exercise program (45 min/twice per week), while the control group didn't receive any exercise program. Outcomes measured before and after the interventions were, right/left discrimination and scores of two questionnaires: Stroop Test and The Pittsburgh SleepQuality Index. RESULTS: Reformer pilates group showed significant improvement in terms of the Stroop Test (STROOP) \"STROOP-B\" (t0 = 156; p < 0.05; Cohen d = 0.12), \"STROOP-C\" (U = 144.5; p < 0.05; Cohen d = 1.13) and \"STROOP-D\" (U = 165; p < 0.05, Cohen d = 0.40) when compared to control group. In the comparison of the results of the right-left separation in both groups, the difference values were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Similarly, in the both groups the sleep quality of the individuals improved, but the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of the current study suggest that Reformer Pilates exercises may be more effective on cognitive functions compared to no exercise intervention in sedentary women.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is an intimate association between chronic pain and substance use disorders, and it is difficult to manage these conditions without causing significant morbidity. Many studies have shown that exercise can alleviate chronic pain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of yoga and Pilates on pain and mood scores among those with chronic pain at a womens' substance use treatment facility. METHODS: This is a prospective questionnaire-based pilot study. One hour of Vinyasa Yoga and 1 h of mat Pilates classes were offered weekly at a women's substance use treatment center between November 11, 2016 and December 16, 2017. Questionnaire data was collected to assess the role of these modalities on pain and mood scores. Descriptive statistics, chi square for categorical outcomes and t-test for continuous outcomes were used for analysis. RESULTS: Among the women in residential rehabilitation for substance use disorder, 37% had chronic pain and the odds ratio of having a prior relapse within this group was 2.8 (95% CI: 1.5-5.4). These classes primarily heightened mood, decreased anxiety, improved self-image and only 21.7% of respondents noted improved pain management. Participants reported an average pain decrease of 0.19 and mood improvement of 0.11 units per week on a scale of 0-10. While pain control was not the primary benefit or motivation behind the classes, pain scores consistently decreased over the course of the study. CONCLUSION: Pain scores improved synergistically with enhanced mood as part of this yoga and Pilates intervention. Yoga and stretching were cited as more beneficial then strengthening, meditation and Pilates. Further studies should be conducted to illuminate whether these interventions could prevent relapse in this population.",

OBJECTIVE: To verify the effects of Pilates on postural misalignment. METHODS: A search (25 February 2024) was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, SportDiscus, and PEDro. The methodological quality was assessed via the PEDro scale, and the certainty of evidence via the GRADE system. The meta-analysis was conducted using the standardised mean difference (SMD). RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included in the systematic review. Eight studies had a low risk of bias. In children and adolescents, there was moderate certainty of evidence that Pilates improves postural alignment of the thoracic angle (SMD = -0.45 [0.67, -0.23]) and lumbar angle (SMD = -0.29 [-0.50, -0.07]) compared with inactive controls, whereas there was very low certainty of evidence that the Schroth technique is superior to Pilates for scoliosis (SMD = 0.98 [0.32, 1.65]). In adults, very low- to low-certainty evidence has indicated that Pilates improves postural alignment of the shoulder angle (SMD = -0.78 [-1.23, -0.33]), scoliosis (SMD = -0.52 [-1.01, -0.04]) and lumbar lordosis (SMD = -0.40 [0.72, -0.08]) compared with inactive controls and improve the craniovertebral angle (SMD = -1.24 [-2.85, -0.38]) compared with stretching and strengthening exercises. CONCLUSION: Pilates has some potential for improving postural misalignment of the thoracic and lumbar angles in children and adolescents. However, for other body segments, due to the low certainty of the evidence, further studies are needed.",

Forty-nine patients (52 ± 5.85 yr.) diagnosed with long COVID related to fatigue symptoms were randomly included in three groups: online Mat Pilates training (n = 16), face-to-face Mat Pilates training (n = 15), and a control group (n = 18) without training. Mat Pilates training was conducted three times a week for 12 weeks. Fatigue, functional capacity, anthropometrics, body composition, and cardiometabolic markers were assessed before and after the interventions. Two-factor Generalized Estimating Equation analyses identified significant differences with Bonferroni post hoc testing (p < 0.05). After the intervention, only the face-to-face Mat Pilates training group had an improved total, physical and mental fatigue, trunk isometric strength, upper limb muscle endurance strength, and aerobic capacity (p < 0.05). No changes were found in fat mass, muscle mass, free fat mass, % of fat, body mass, body mass index, or waist and hip circumferences. No significant changes were observed in blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, or blood pressure (p > 0.05). Our results highlight the potential of face-to-face Mat Pilates training as an effective intervention to mitigate persistent symptoms of long COVID related to fatigue and functional capacities.",

Early management is needed to reduce its mortality and morbidity. The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether Pilates training could help burn patients with inhalation injury after flame thermal burn in increasing pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, and functional ability. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, sixty participants (26 males and 34 females) with inhalation injury and deep partial-thickness flame burns of 30-40 % total body surface area (TBSA) were randomized in blocks of four, with a 1:1 allocation ratio into two groups: Group A (Pilates Group); received Pilates training plus conventional physical therapy program, and Group B (Control Group); received conventional physical therapy program only. This study was conducted at the Faculty of Physical Therapy's outpatient clinic, Cairo University, 3 sessions/week for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the forced vital capacity (FVC) measured by a spirometer, while the secondary outcome measures were peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1/FVC% assessed by a spirometer, strength of respiratory muscles (maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) assessed by the digital manovacuometer, and the functional capacity evaluated by 6-Minute Walk Test (6-MWT). RESULTS: A two-way mixed-design MANOVA was used to analyze the results within and between groups. There were no significant differences in demographic data between groups (P > 0.05). There were significant differences in all variables after treatment in group A compared with group B; FVC (95 % CI: 0.38, 1.13) (P = 0.001), FEV1 (95 % CI: 0.39, 0.97) (P = 0.001), FEV1/FVC % (95 % CI: 1.90, 17.19) (P = 0.02), PEFR (95 % CI: 0.47, 0.99) (P = 0.001), MIP (95 % CI: 5.12, 11.44) (P = 0.001), MEP (95 % CI: 2.57, 8.24) (P = 0.001), 6-MWT (95 % CI: 27.22, 54.96) (P = 0.001), FVC (% predicted) (95 % CI: 3.58, 12.58) (P = 0.001), FEV1 (% predicted) (95 % CI: 1.21, 11.11) (P = 0.02), PEFR (% predicted) (95 % CI: 1.33, 10.83) (P = 0.01), MIP (% predicted) (95 % CI: 2.26, 11.72) (P = 0.001) and MEP (% predicted) (95 % CI: 1.33, 10.37) (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrated that a Pilates exercise program in addition to a traditional physical therapy program for 12 weeks significantly improved the pulmonary function (FVC, FEV1, PEFR and FEV1/FEV), strength of respiratory muscles (MIP and MEP), and functional capacity (6-MWT) in patients with inhalation injury after flame burns. These results underscore the importance of including Pilates exercises in the rehabilitation plan for burn patients with inhalation injury. Future studies are needed to evaluate the effect of Pilates exercises on other degrees and TBSA of burn, long-term follow up, and to measure cardiopulmonary parameters.",

METHODS: The 37 patients were randomized into the 3 groups. The CM for 1st group, CPE for 2nd group and CM+CPE for 3rd group were applied 3 days/a week for 6 weeks. Pain frequency, pain intensity, number of analgesic, were recorded. The posture was measured by Posture Screen application, the cervical range of motion by the CROM device, deep neck flexor muscle endurance by the pressurized biofeedback device. Evaluations were applied 2 times as pre-post treatment. RESULTS: In within-group comparison a decrease in pain parameters, neck-shoulder postural deviation and an increase DNFE and CROM were observed in all groups (p<0.05). In between-group comparison pain frequency, intensity and number of analgesics were significant changes in the CM and CM+CPE groups according to CPE (respectively p<0,001, p=0,001, p=0,018). Head and shoulder angulation were significant in the CPE and CM+CPE groups according to CM (respectively p=0.009, p=0,011). It was determined that the cervical right lateral flexion range of motion and right rotation were significant changes in the CM and CM+CPE groups according to CPE (respectively p=0,026, p=0,040). DNFE were significantly increased in CM+CPE according to CM and CPE (p=0.001).

The search year is set from January 1, 2019, to November 15, 2023. STUDY SELECTION: Quasi-experimental studies, randomized controlled trials, randomized clinical trials, and nonrandomized controlled trials investigating the effects of Pilates on body posture. DATA EXTRACTION: The Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale was used to evaluate the quality of studies that met the inclusion requirements. Studies were independently assessed by 2 reviewers who read through the full text and labeled as \"low quality,\" \"moderate quality,\" \"good quality,\" and \"excellence quality.\" Disagreements were resolved by the third reviewer. The Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB 2.0) tool was used to assess the risk of bias for each study. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of the 492 studies screened, 13 met the inclusion criteria involving a total of 783 trial participants. Six studies (46%) were of high quality or above, with main limitation related to the internal validity of the study design. The research outcomes focused primarily on effects of Pilates on body posture; cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine; and followed by quality of life and pain. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this systematic review provided valuable evidence for the role of Pilates in improving body posture problems. Pilates is a boon to patients suffering from postural disorders, and it is suggested that Pilates can be widely used as a complementary therapy. Nonetheless, more detailed studies are necessary in the future."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Pilates exercise is commonly used in the rehabilitation of individuals with musculoskeletal conditions, but dosing parameters for optimal outcomes are unclear. Large variations exist in Pilates-based protocols, and research related to specific dosing is sparse. OBJECTIVE: To identify optimal dose parameters of Pilates exercise when applied to the rehabilitation of musculoskeletal conditions. DATA SOURCES: English-language articles published up to February 2023, in the PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Pedro databases. STUDY SELECTION: Articles where patients 20-60 years old with musculoskeletal conditions received a Pilates-based exercise intervention and reported quantification of treatment dose. A total of 72 full-text articles were assessed, with 14 meeting inclusion criteria. STUDY DESIGN: Scoping review. DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators (A.P.S., G.K.) independently identified all proposed Pilates-based protocols and outcome measures from the included studies. RESULTS: From the 1667 references initially found in 4 databases, 14 studies were included of which 13 were randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental (612 patients) and 1 was a Cochrane review (19,642 patients). Eight studies were of high methodological quality. The most frequent musculoskeletal condition examined was chronic low back pain. Pilates dosage regarding total intervention duration ranged from 6 to 16 weeks, but the most frequent duration reported was 8 weeks and 2 to 3 sessions per week with sessions lasting 50 to 60 minutes. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that there are clinically relevant Pilates dosing parameters that result in improved outcomes for patients with musculoskeletal disorders."

DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial with a six-month follow-up. SETTING: Rehabilitation clinic. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and forty-five individuals (18-50 years of age) with low back pain for ≥ 12 consecutive weeks were enrolled and randomly allocated to either Pilates (n = 72) or home-based exercise groups (n = 73). INTERVENTIONS: Method Pilates (Mat Pilates exercises using accessories) versus home-based exercise (postural exercises, muscle stretching and strengthening, and spine stabilisation/mobilisation), twice a week, for 6 weeks. MAIN MEASURES: Assessments were performed at baseline, post-intervention, and six months follow-up. Outcomes were pain intensity, disability, and health-related quality of life. RESULTS: At post-intervention, the Pilates group had significantly lower pain intensity (mean difference = -1.14; 95% CI -2.05; -0.23), less disability (mean difference = -6.7; 95% CI -11.3; -2.0), and higher health-related quality of life (mean difference = 0.102; 95% CI 0.054; 0151) compared to the home-based exercise group. At follow-up, the Pilates group had a significantly higher health-related quality of life (mean difference = 0.055; 95% CI 0.003; 0.106) compared with the home-based exercise group but there were no significant differences in pain and disability. A significant overall effect of Pilates compared to home-based exercise was found for disability (mean difference = -4.4; 95% CI -7.6; -1.1), and health-related quality of life (mean difference = 0.049; 95% CI 0.022; 0.076), but not for pain. CONCLUSION: Although Pilates was significantly superior to home exercise for pain and disability, the differences were not considered clinically relevant. However, Pilates did provide significant and clinically relevant differences in utility.",

METHODS: This is a quasi-experimental study which was conducted at Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), and Hospital Al-Sultan Abdullah, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Malaysia. The intervention group performed Pilates exercises with a certified Pilates instructor for eight weeks via online streaming from the participants' homes. Meanwhile, the control group participants received the usual care as stipulated by their oncologists. The primary outcome was the quality of life. The secondary outcomes were functional capacity, cancer-related fatigue, depression and salivary cortisol. Data was collected at baseline and eight weeks after the exercise intervention. The effects of the intervention were analyzed using Repeated Measures Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) statistical test. RESULT: Thirty-six (36) colorectal cancer survivors were allocated into either a Pilates exercise intervention group (N= 18) or a control group (N= 18). Over eight weeks, the Pilates exercise group revealed significant group x time interactions in terms of quality of life (p = 0.003), role functioning (p = 0.012), functional capacity (p = 0.048), and stool frequency (p = 0.021). However, only the stool frequency symptom (p = 0.008) remained significant after controlling for the confounders of age, gender and stage of cancer. No significant changes in cancer-related fatigue, depression and salivary cortisol levels between the groups were observed after the intervention. CONCLUSION: Pilates exercise had positive impacts on role functioning, bowel function, and functional capacity among colorectal cancer survivors, ultimately contributing to an improvement in quality of life.",

Despite various treatments, effective management remains challenging. Pilates, recognized for its focus on core strength and postural alignment, has emerged as a promising intervention. This study investigates the impact of mind-body in Pilates for directing participants on CNSLBP outcomes. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 67 participants, aged 18 to 65 years, suffering from CNSLBP. They were allocated into two groups: Pilates with mind-body cueing (n = 34) and Pilates without cueing (n = 33). Both groups underwent 60 min sessions twice weekly for 8 weeks. Outcome measures included pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale), functional disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire), fear of movement (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia), and adherence (percentage of sessions attended). Statistical significance was determined through repeated measures ANOVA. Results: Both groups showed significant improvement in pain reduction, functional ability, and kinesiophobia. However, the mind-body group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in kinesiophobia compared to the non-cueing group (p = 0.048), indicating the potential additional benefit of mind-body cueing in managing movement-related fear in CNSLBP. Conclusions: This study underscores the effectiveness of an 8-week Pilates intervention in managing CNSLBP, highlighting the added value of mind-body cueing in reducing fear of movement. These findings suggest incorporating mind-body cueing in Pilates could enhance the therapeutic benefits, particularly for patients with high levels of movement-related fear, potentially improving long-term adherence to physical activity and rehabilitation outcomes."

The effect of supporting clinical Pilates exercises with passive physiotherapy methods on biopsychosocial status is still unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate the effects of conventional treatment (CT) in addition to clinical Pilates on pain levels, physical condition, functional status, and psychosocial status in individuals with chronic neck pain. METHODS: Fifty women were randomly divided into 2 groups, the clinical Pilates group (Pilates, n= 25), and the group receiving CT in addition to clinical Pilates (Pilates-CT, n= 25). Both groups received treatment 3 days a week for 6 weeks. The CT program involved the implementation of hot pack (HP) application, Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), and therapeutic ultrasound (US) to the cervical area. RESULTS: CT in addition to Pilates was more effective in reducing the Visual Analog Scale (at rest and during activity), Neck Disability Index, Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, NeckPix Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression, and Cognitive Exercise Therapy Approach-Biopsychosocial questionnaire scores (p< 0.05) and in increasing the degree of change in the extension range of motion (ROM) and cervical flexor endurance values and scores in the energy parameter of Short Form-36 (p< 0.05). CONCLUSION: CT provided in addition to Pilates was more effective in reducing pain levels, disability, fear of movement, depression levels, and negative biopsychosocial status and improving extension ROM and cervical flexor endurance, neck awareness, and the energy/vitality parameter of quality of life in individuals with chronic neck pain.",

This study included 45 older adults and aimed to compare balance, muscle strength, and proprioception with and without a 6-week program of Pilates training using the Vibro-Swing system. MATERIAL AND METHODS The present study included 45 older adults (mean age: 78.31±4.50). The experimental group (n=24) underwent a Pilates with Vibro-Swing exercise. The control group (n=21) participated in regular Pilates exercise. Both groups engaged in exercise for 40-50 minutes per session, twice a week, for 6 weeks, resulting in a total of 12 intervention sessions. Assessments were conducted before and after the intervention. The pre-post test evaluated balance (gait analysis, 10-meter walk test [10 MWT], functional reach test [FRT]), muscle strength (Five Times Sit-to-Stand Test [FTSS], grip strength), and proprioception (wrist joint position sense [WRT_30°]). RESULTS The experimental group exhibited statistically significant differences in velocity, cadence, 10MWT, FRT, FTSS, right grip, left grip, and wrist joint position sense (extension 30°) between the pre- and post-test (P>0.05). The experimental group exhibited statistically significant differences in gait velocity, cadence, 10 MWT, FTSS, right grip strength, FRT, and [WRT_30°] results compared with the control group (P>0.05).

Methods: Twenty-six university students with UCS were randomly allocated into 60 min Pilates (60 PG, n = 9), 30 min Pilates (30 PG, n = 9), and control (CG, n = 8) groups. The 60 and 30 PG students participated in the Pilates program, focusing on relaxation, stability, mobility, and strengthening of the cervical, thoracic, and scapular muscles for 60 or 30 min per session, twice a week, for 12 weeks. Cervicothoracic alignment was measured using BodyStyle to determine craniovertebral angle (CVA), forward shoulder angle (FSA), head position angle (HPA), head tilt angle (HTA), and kyphosis angle (KA). We measured the muscular strength and endurance of the shoulder on the dominant side. Results: After the intervention, CVA, HPA, HTA, and KA significantly improved in the 60 and 30 PG (all p < 0.01) but not in the CG (p > 0.05). There were no significant differences between the 60 and 30 PG at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Shoulder strength differed between shoulder flexion and horizontal abduction (p < 0.01). Shoulder endurance differed between extension, flexion, and horizontal abduction (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: This study confirmed the effectiveness of the Pilates program in improving cervicothoracic sagittal alignment and shoulder muscular function in university students with UCS. Additionally, the effects of participating in 60 and 30 min Pilates programs were found to be equivalent. Therefore, encouraging busy university students to participate in at least 30 min of the Pilates program is important."

Process, management, and scientific-feasibility metrics were analyzed descriptively. Functional outcomes, physical activity, and MS-related outcomes (impact, fatigue, and quality of life) were measured pre- and postintervention and analyzed using mixed-effects models, analysis of variance, and cluster analysis. Twenty-two participants completed baseline testing. Sixteen completed the intervention and postintervention testing. Collapsed across groups, analyses demonstrated improvements in the Timed 25-Foot Walk (36%), Timed Up-and-Go (13%), and the Berg Balance Scale (10%, statistically significant). Neither between-groups differences nor physical activity or MS outcome changes were significant. Participants reported high satisfaction. Findings suggest that virtual, seated Pilates is feasible and may confer balance benefits to individuals with MS.",

METHOD: In this single-center, single-blind, randomized, controlled study, 126 participants who have 28-30 weeks of gestation and nulliparous were randomly assigned to receive either the (n = 63) or control group (n = 63). The study was carried out between March and August 2022. Pregnancy pilates intervention was applied twice in a week, a total of 8 weeks to pilates group. The control group was given routine obstetric and pregnancy care. A personal data form and the Michigan Incontinence Severity Index Form (M-ISI) were used as data collection tools. RESULTS: The mean weight gains of the experimental group during pregnancy were significantly lower than the control group. The experimental group had almost twice the rate of vaginal birth than those of the control group. The duration of labor mean score of experimental group was 5 h and 43 min less than the duration of labor of the control group (p < 0.001). After intervention, and postpartum period, the SUI and UUI severity of the experimental group was significantly lower than those of the control group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Pilates-assisted childbirth preparation training reduced the severity of UI including SUI and UUI symptoms during pregnancy and the early postpartum. In addition, pilates-assisted childbirth preparation training contributes to decrease in weight gain during pregnancy, the increase in the vaginal birth rate, and the shortening of the duration of labor.

METHODS: Thirty-eight adults with CNLBP were randomly assigned to two groups: Pilates exercise + active PBMT (PIL + PBMT) or Pilates exercise + sham PBMT (PIL + SHAM). Both groups performed an 8-week mat Pilates program and received PBMT on their lumbar muscles 10 min before and after each session. The following variables were assessed before and after intervention: peak pain intensity, postural balance (i.e., center of the pressure [A-COP], velocity anteroposterior [Vel AP], and velocity mediolateral [Vel ML]), perceived disability (i.e., Oswestry Disability Index [ODI] and Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire [RMDQ]), and pain-related fear of movement (i.e., Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia [TSK], Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire [FABQ], and Pain Catastrophizing Scale [PCS]). RESULTS: Postural balance variables showed no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) across time or between groups. The groups showed similar (p < 0.05) reductions in peak pain intensity, ODI, RMDQ, and PCS scores, but no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) in TSK and FABQ scores. CONCLUSION: The mat Pilates program reduced peak pain intensity, perceived disability, and pain catastrophizing in adults with CNLBP, but PBMT had no additional effect on these variables. Mat Pilates alone or combined with PBMT was not able to improve postural balance."

METHODS: This was a randomized clinical trial with 30 survivors, allocated into an intervention group and a control group. The intervention group underwent a 12-week Mat Pilates, twice a week, one hour long, and the control group attended two lectures and received weekly follow-up throughout the study period. Data collection took place through individual face-to-face interviews, focusing on assessing the outcomes: quality of life (FACT-H&N); fatigue (FACT-F) and body image (BIS). RESULTS: The Mat Pilates group showed significant improvements compared to the control group in both intragroup and intergroup analyses across the variables: quality of life (in total score (p = 0.007)/(p = 0.003), family well-being (p = 0.001)/(p = 0.008) and functional well-being (p = 0.001)/(p = 0.001)); body image in the total score (p = 0.001)/(p = 0.001) and in the subscales: body image (p = 0.046)/(p = 0.010), body care (p = 0.026)/(p = 0.010) and body touch (p = 0.013)/(p = 0.022); fatigue (p = 0.006)/(p = 0.003).

This study's objective was to compare the effects of Pilates exercises, corrective exercises, and Alexander's technique on upper cross syndrome in adolescent girls aged 13-16 years: a six-week intervention study. METHODS: The present study was Quasi-experimental, and its statistical population consisted of 13 to 16-year-old female students. Forty-five students who were diagnosed with upper cross syndrome were purposefully selected as samples and randomly assigned to three groups: Pilates exercises (N = 15), corrective exercises (N = 15), and Alexander's technique (N = 15). The participants performed exercises for 60 min per session, three sessions per week, and six weeks. This study's objective was to compare the effects of Pilates exercises, corrective exercises, and Alexander's technique on upper cross syndrome in adolescent girls aged 13-16 years: a six-week intervention study. This study was retrospectively registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) on 2023-09-19 to comply with the journal's policies. The assigned trial registration number is IRCT20230810059106N1. RESULTS: The results of the dependent t-test showed significant decreases in forward head angle (p = 0.0001), rounded shoulder (p = 0.001), and kyphosis (p = 0.0001) as a result of corrective exercises. There were also significant decreases in forward head angle (p = 0.0001), rounded shoulder (p = 0.002), and kyphosis (p = 0.001) after six weeks of practising Alexander's technique. However, in the case of Pilates exercises, a significant decrease in forward head angle (p = 0.110), rounded shoulder (p = 0.598), and kyphosis (p = 0.371) was not observed. The one-way analysis of variance revealed a significant difference in the forward head angle (p = 0.012), rounded shoulders (p = 0.013), and kyphosis (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The effect of Alexander's technique and corrective exercises on forward head angle, rounded shoulder, and kyphosis abnormalities was almost similar and more effective than pilates exercises."

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Physiotherapy approaches are used to eliminate the problems caused by cervicogenic headache (CHA), known as secondary headache associated with the structures of the upper cervical region. This study aimed to investigate the effects of cervical mobilization (CM) with clinical Pilates exercises (CPE) on pain, muscle stiffness and head-neck blood flow in CGH. Materials and Methods: A total of 25 patients participated in this randomized controlled study and were randomized into either the CM group or the CM+CPE group. All treatment methods were applied 3 days a week for 6 weeks. The outcome measure was headache intensity and frequency, the number of analgesics, muscle stiffness and vertebral artery (VA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) blood flow. Headache intensity was measured by a visual analogue scale, muscle stiffness by a myotonometer and blood flow by Doppler US. Evaluations were repeated after 6 weeks of treatment. Within-group comparisons were made by the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and between-group comparisons were made by the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: After treatments in the two groups, headache intensity and frequency and the number of analgesics decreased, the muscle stiffness of the suboccipital, upper trapezius and sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscles decreased, and the blood flow of the ICA and VA increased (p < 0.05). There was a significant difference between the groups in terms of headache intensity (p = 0.025) and muscle stiffness in SKM (p = 0.044) in favor of the CM+CPE group. Conclusions: Non-pharmacological treatment approaches have an important role in CHA related to the upper cervical region. This study suggests that it would be beneficial to add CM in combination with CPE to the non-pharmacological treatment of patients with CHA.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Standardised guidelines for stance are used to improve interobserver reliability in anthropometric measurements in clinical practice. A key feature of the stance in Pilates is the 'drawing in and up' of the abdomen. The aim of this study was to study the impact of the Pilates stance on height, waist circumference and interscapular distance, compared to that recommended in clinical practice. METHODS: 48 healthy females (median age 60 years) were assessed before and after 10-week Pilates-based matwork training. One Pilates expert and one novice took independent measurements of weight, height, waist circumference and interscapular distance (ISD). RESULTS: Pilates stance, compared to Normal, increased height by up to 2.7 cm and decreased waist up to 5.2 cm (each P < 0.001, repeated measures ANOVA). ISD decreased up to 14 mm (P < 0.001) and this decrease was greater after training (P < 0.001). After controlling for age and length of time learning Pilates, greater baseline ISD predicted a greater change in ISD after the intervention. Effect of Pilates stance was greater when the expert took the measurements (each P ≤ 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Activation of trunk muscles in the Pilates stance increases height and decreases waist circumference, compared to the stance recommended in UK healthcare settings. A decrease in ISD was observed, which was greater after a Pilates-based matwork programme. There are significant inter-observer differences, therefore current clinical guidelines for stance are recommended for repeated anthropometry. The value of the Pilates stance in improving posture and the role of ISD as a marker, should be further studied in various contexts, including clinical settings.",

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the effects of a Pilates-based exercise program on low back pain of helicopter pilots of the Brazilian Air Force. METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial with fifteen helicopter pilots of the Brazilian Air Force, who were assessed for pain intensity (Numerical Pain Rating Scale), disability associated with low back pain, and spine muscle endurance in three positions: trunk extension (Ito test) and left and right lateral bridge. Individuals were randomly distributed into the regular exercises group (REG) (n = 7), oriented to maintain their exercise routine, and Pilates group (PG) (n = 8), which performed an exercise program based on Pilates method twice a week for 12 weeks. Reassessments occurred after 6 and 12 weeks. Data were analyzed on SPSS 20.0 software using a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: PG showed a significant reduction in low back pain after 12 weeks of training compared with REG (mean difference of 3.5 points, p < 0.0001). We also observed increased endurance of trunk extensors (p = 0.002) and right (p = 0.001) and left lateral muscles (p = 0.001) in the PG compared with REG. However, the indexes of disability did not change between groups. CONCLUSION: Pain intensity was significantly reduced while spine muscle endurance increased in PG compared with REG after intervention; thus, Pilates-based exercises should be considered in physical conditioning programs for helicopter pilots.",

This study investigated the feasibility and safety of a short-term Pilates-based exercise program in the treatment of upper limb motor coordination for people with PD. METHODS: Fifteen patients - n (%) 4 women/11 men (27/73), median [interquartile range] age 66 [9] years - participated in this quasi-experimental (before-and-after) clinical trial. Patients underwent a 6-week (30 min/day, 3 days/week) Pilates exercise program using Reformer, Cadillac, Chair, and Barrel equipment. Feasibility was evaluated by adherence to the program and the ability to perform the exercises including progressions on difficulty. Safety was evaluated based on self-reported adverse events. Clinical and functional trends before and after the intervention were also computed regarding handgrip strength (HGS), fine motor coordination (9 Hole Peg Test; 9HPT), bradykinesia (Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale; MDS-UPDRS), and upper limb functionality (Test D'évaluation des Membres Supérieurs des Personnes Âgées, TEMPA). RESULTS: Of the 18 Pilates sessions, exercise adherence was 100%. The only adverse event observed was mild muscle pain. Pre-post differences were observed only for body bradykinesia and hypokinesia (1.0 [0.0] vs. 0.0 [1.0] s, adjusted p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: A short-term Pilates-based exercise program in the treatment of upper limb muscle strength, manual dexterity, bradykinesia, and functionality is feasible and safe for people with PD.

This study was designed to primarily test, in pregnant women, the dose-response and health effects of both pre-partum and post-partum, online Pilates-based program on weight control, low back pain (LBP) severity, sleep disturbances, mood and depression levels. Methods: A total of 136 pregnant women were screened for eligibility (low-risk pregnancy; aged 18-45 years; single pregnancy; 20-28-week gestational age, normal BMI). Participants completed an online Pilates-based program during pregnancy and after delivery, through an online platform guided by a Pilates, Yoga and Lagree certified instructor. Main outcomes (weight control, LBP disability, sleep quality, mood, and mental health) were assessed at baseline and at the completion of pre- and post-partum programs. Results: Regarding pre-partum, significant gains in weight were observed only in low- and intermediate-amount exercisers. Only high-amount exercisers did not display significant increase in LBP-related disability (+42.7%; p = .21) unlike low (+12.2%; p < .0001) and intermediate exercisers (+9.6%; p < .0001). Sleep disturbances increased significantly in low- (+24.3%; p = .005) but not in intermediate- (+4.6%; p = .50) and high-amount exercisers (-0.1%; p = .91). Regardless of the amount of exercise, depression scores improved in all groups. Following post-partum intervention (n = 40), only intermediate-amount exercisers showed significant reductions in sleep disturbances (-24.1%; p = .003) and depression (15.9%; p = .04). Conclusions: Approximately 270 min/week of an online Pilates-based program were needed to prevent LBP worsening, and sleep deterioration in pregnant women. A different pattern was outlined for those women resuming the Pilates-based intervention at post-partum, with 150 min/week emerging as the \"dose\" of exercise capable of inducing the largest improvements in LBP, sleep, and mood disturbances.",

The objective was to analyze the effects of adding a six-month Pilates exercise program to a three-month pulmonary rehabilitation for individuals with COPD. METHODS: Thirty-five participants with COPD (GOLD B) were assigned to the intervention (n=14) or control (n=21) group. Both groups received an initial three months of a pulmonary rehabilitation program. The intervention group further underwent six months of pilates. Participants were evaluated at baseline and at three, six, and nine months. Lung function and strength of respiratory muscles were defined as primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included cardiac, physical function, and exacerbation episodes. RESULTS: There were no consistent statistically significant differences between groups for the lung function outcomes (p\\<0.05). Maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure increased significantly at three months in both groups (p\\<0.05). It was significantly superior in the intervention group at nine months for maximal inspiratory pressure (p=0.005) and six and nine months for maximal expiratory pressure (p=0.027 and p\\<0.001, respectively). Changes in muscle strength (knee extension and handgrip) were comparable between groups (p>0.05), but exercise-induced fatigue and balance were significantly superior in the intervention group at the six- and nine-month follow-ups (p\\<0.05). DISCUSSION: Pilates exercise programs may be implemented to augment traditional pulmonary rehabilitation with the goal of improving the strength of respiratory muscles. CONCLUSION: Adding a Pilates exercise program to pulmonary rehabilitation resulted in superior strength of respiratory muscles, higher resistance to exercise-induced fatigue, and improved balance."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Primary dysmenorrhea, commonly known as menstrual cramps, is a prevalent gynecological issue that impacts many women in their childbearing age. It manifests as reoccurring, cramp-like lower abdominal pain, usually commencing right prior to or during the menstrual period. These painful sensations can be severe, extending to the lower back and upper thighs can greatly disrupt a woman's daily life and overall well-being. The optimal exercise approach is needed for individuals seeking relief from primary dysmenorrhea, allowing healthcare providers and women themselves to make informed decisions regarding their treatment options. Though many forms of exercise interventions exist in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea, this study aims to compare two forms of intervention namely pilates and gym ball exercises on pain and menstrual distress among women with Primary Dysmenorrhea. METHODS: This experimental comparative study was carried out with 30 young female participants over a 12-week period. Participant recruitment was done through a simple random sampling method. The criteria of inclusion encompassed young females aged 17-25 years, those in good health, and those experiencing primary dysmenorrhea. Exclusion criteria included secondary dysmenorrhea, medication use, polycystic ovarian syndrome, bleeding disorders, positive pregnancy tests, breastfeeding, and other medical conditions. Group A received Pilates exercises, while Group B underwent Gym ball exercises. The assessment of both groups' menstrual distress levels was conducted using the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ) and pain scores using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). RESULT: In the statistical analysis, Group A (Pilates Exercises) showed a significantly lower mean value (2.60) on the VAS compared to Group B (Swiss Ball Exercises) (5.46), with both groups experiencing a notable reduction in post-test scores (p ≤ 0.001). Additionally, on the MOOS MDQ score, Group A (Pilates Exercises) achieved a lower mean value (79.33) compared to Group B (Swiss Ball Exercises) (103.26), with both groups demonstrating a significant decrease in post-test scores (p ≤ 0.001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study underscores the significance of exercise therapy, particularly Pilates exercises, as a holistic approach to addressing primary dysmenorrhea, improving physical well-being, and enhancing the overall quality of life."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The effects of stretching exercises on muscle strength have been widely researched in the literature, however, there are no studies investigating the effects of Pilates stretching. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of static stretching and Pilates stretching on the concentric muscle strength of the knee extensors and flexors. METHOD: 102 trained young adults were randomized into three groups: static stretching (n = 33); Pilates stretching (n = 34); control (n = 35). Isokinetic evaluation of the knee extensor and flexor muscles was performed at 60°/s and 180°/s, pre and post acute intervention with stretching. Interventions in the static stretching and Pilates stretching groups occurred in 3 sets x 30 s for each body region considered (a-knee extensor muscles; b-knee flexor muscles). The control group did not perform any intervention. RESULTS: No difference (p > 0.05) was observed between the groups after the intervention. There was only a significant intragroup improvement for the control group on the isokinetic muscle strength of the knee flexors at 180°/s, with a moderate effect size, considering the entire sample (p = 0.040; d = 0.42) and when considering only male gender (p = 0.010; d = 0.60). CONCLUSION: Static stretching or Pilates stretching performed as a warm-up did not impair or enhance the concentric muscle strength performance of the knee extensors and flexors. In this way, both forms of stretching can be considered as preparatory exercises before muscle strength training.",

METHODS: Twenty-two patients (Male:7; Female:15) with NSLBP aged 20-65 years were recruited and classified based on a modified O'Sullivan's classification system into flexion pattern (FP) or active extension pattern (EP) groups. Oswestry Disability index (ODI), Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) as well as radiographic lumbar global range of motion (ROM) and lumbo-pelvic alignment were measured Pre- and immediately post-intervention and at 6- and 12-month. The intervention included supervised six-weeks Pilates program with 60 min per session and up to two sessions per week. RESULTS: Lumbar lordosis, sacral slope and sacral inclination were found to be significantly different between the FP and EP groups based on the O'Sullivan's classification system. However, despite the significant changes in RMDQ (p = 0.001), no significant changes were found for any of the alignment parameters (p > 0.05) post intervention for both groups. For lumbar global ROM, a statistically significant change was observed for the EP group (p = 0.028) but not for the FP group (p = 0.249). No significant correlations were identified between any of the self-reported outcomes, radiographic alignment and ROM parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Patients self-perceived long-term functional improvements based on responding to questionnaires after Pilates exercises were not reflected in significant changes in lumbo-pelvic alignment or lumbar ROM. This may be due to the current cohort demonstrating within normal ranges due to the lesser severity of their condition, but further research is needed for clarification.",

METHODS: This randomized prospective quantitative clinical trial compared the effects of Eutony, Holistic Gymnastics, and Pilates on hamstring flexibility and back pain. The sample consisted of 80 pre-adolescent girls aged 10-13 years and divided into three groups: Eutony, with 26 girls; Holistic Gymnastics, 27 girls; and Pilates, 27 girls. The participants underwent ten 1-h weekly interventions. Hamstring flexibility was evaluated using fingertip-to-floor, sit-and-reach, and hip angle tests; back pain was evaluated using the Body Posture Evaluation Instrument questionnaire and the way they carried their backpack by the Layout for Assessing Dynamic Posture. Descriptive statistical analysis, analysis of variance, and Kruskal-Wallis test were performed at a 5 % significance level (p < 0.05). RESULTS: The three body practices increased hamstring flexibility in all fingertip-to-floor (7.77 cm), hip angle (5.58°), and sit-and-reach evaluations (9.07 cm). Before the intervention, 66.25 % of participants complained of back pain. After the intervention, only 37.50 % continued with the complaint. Moreover, 25 % of pre-adolescent girls started to carry their school backpack correctly. CONCLUSION: Eutony, Holistic Gymnastics, and Pilates increased hamstring flexibility, reduced back pain complaints, and incentivized the girls to carry the school backpack correctly.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Aging leads to vascular endothelial dysfunction and muscle impairment. While resistance exercise improves muscular function, its acute effects on vascular function vary in the literature, with some studies reporting detrimental effects. These findings indicate the need for exercises that optimize muscle function without compromising vascular function. Reformer Pilates (RP) is a low-impact exercise involving an adjustable sliding platform. However, the acute effects of RP on vascular function among older adults remain unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the acute effects of RP on vascular function in older adults. METHODS: Overall, 17 participants (age: 65 ± 2.76 years, body mass index: 23.42 ± 3.68 kg/m2) were examined and assigned to control and RP conditions under a randomized crossover design. The RP condition involved a 3.5-5 omnibus perceived exertion scale with 19 exercise postures for 60 min. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), and blood pressure were measured at baseline and 0, 10, 30, and 60 min after exercise. RESULTS: RP significantly improved FMD at all time points compared with that at baseline (p &lt; 0.05). baPWV increased at 0 min post-RP but returned to baseline levels at other time points. Additionally, RP showed improved FMD at 0, 10, and 30 min compared with that in the control condition (p &lt; 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed in blood pressure or mean arterial pressure in either condition. CONCLUSION: RP enhanced FMD and regulated blood pressure for approximately 60 min post-exercise, suggesting its suitability for older adults to enhance vascular function and control blood pressure during exercise. Nonetheless, longitudinal resistance training intervention studies are needed to validate these findings.",

Yet remote platforms could overcome such obstacles and increase participation. This study evaluated the effectiveness of remote-synchronous group-Pilates classes compared to in-studio classes in healthy sedentary women. In a randomized controlled design, 40 women, aged 20-45, were assigned to a Zoom or studio group-Pilates training. The intervention included twice-weekly 45 min sessions over an eight-week period. Attendance (adherence) was recorded, and the participants completed physical motor tests (plank, curl-up, stork, push-up, and V-sit and reach), Profile of Mood State Surveys, and Nordic Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaires. Evaluations were performed at baseline, mid-intervention (4 weeks), and post intervention (8 weeks). Adherence to training was high in the Zoom and studio groups (80% and 74%, respectively). Improvements in physical motor tests were seen in both groups following the Pilates interventions, thereby indicating the effectiveness of group-Pilates Zoom training. In conclusion, remote online physical activity such as Pilates offers a good alternative to in-studio trainings, as a means for improving physical fitness and promoting a healthy lifestyle in adults, by offering a more accessible and less timely alternative to in-studio physical activity programs."

Thirty-five females were randomly assigned to a home-based Pilates group (PG, n = 18) or a group without intervention (control group, CG, n = 17). All participants followed a Mediterranean diet. The PG followed a twelve-week online Pilates Matwork program (three times/week; 180 min/week), while the CG was not involved in any structured physical exercise program. Body composition and handgrip strength were evaluated at baseline (T0) and after the intervention (T1). A significant group × time interaction (p < 0.05) was found for the fat mass percentage (pFM). Specifically, the pFM was significantly lower at T1 than at T0 in the PG. Significant group × time interactions for fat-free mass (p < 0.05), appendicular skeletal muscle mass (p < 0.05), and skeletal muscle mass (p < 0.01) were found. All these variables were significantly higher at T1 than at T0 in the PG (p < 0.05).

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effect of the Pilates method on the quality of life, fatigue, and sleep quality of patients undergoing adjuvant clinical treatment with hormone therapy for breast cancer. METHODS: A randomized two-arm clinical trial with 34 breast cancer women that were randomized into two groups: a) Intervention group, who performed 16 weeks of mat Pilates; b) Control group, who maintained their daily routine activities and received three educational sessions. The questionnaires for each variable were applied before the intervention, after the intervention, and six months after the end of the intervention. Quality of life was assessed by The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), fatigue by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-F), and sleep quality by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. RESULTS: The fatigue variable presented a time effect (p = 0.034) regardless of the analyzed group, in which a difference was found between baseline and the post-intervention period (p = 0.037). The variable sleep showed an effect of time (p = 0.025), presenting a difference between the baseline period and six months, with improvement for all participants (p = 0.004). Global health also showed a positive change also for all participants, with an isolated effect of time (p = 0.024). CONCLUSION: Interventions based on the Pilates method may bring positive results in quality of life, fatigue, and sleep quality in patients undergoing adjuvant treatment for breast cancer, but further studies on the subject are needed to prove the results in a larger number of patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human aging is a natural, biological, progressive, dynamic and complex process that involves morphological, physiological and social changes. Alterations such as decreased postural balance increase the risk of falls and exercise has shown benefits. One of the possible exercise modalities for this population is Pilates. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of Pilates on parameters of static and dynamic postural balance in older women. METHODS: Women aged 60 years or over were evaluated at three time points (pre-training, mid-training, and post-training). Postural balance was assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), and a force platform. The Pilates exercise protocol consisted of 16 sessions, twice a week, lasting 50 min each. Normality of the data was determined by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Repeated measures ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test was used for comparison between assessments. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: Fourteen older women were included. Assessment on the force platform revealed no significant differences for most of the variables evaluated. There was a significant difference in SPPB scores and TUG times pre- and post-treatment (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Pilates training significantly improved dynamic postural balance evaluated by the TUG and SPPB but did not significantly improve static balance evaluated by the force platform, although the values have decreased in most assessments.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 145 recovered COVID-19 university students between the ages of 19 and 25 participated in this single-blinded, randomized controlled trial study. The participants were divided into a Pilates group and a control group, each of which received a home exercise program. Core muscle endurance was measured using the five basic endurance tests and static balance using the Prokin system with open eyes (OE) and closed eyes (CE) at baseline and after three months of treatment. RESULTS: All measured parameters showed improvement within the groups after treatment. Group comparison revealed a significant increase in the Pilates group in all core endurance tests (P<0.001). The Prokin system results showed improvement in the Pilates group after treatment, while perimeter with OE, CE, and ellipse area with EC decreased (P<0.001), but there was no significant difference in ellipse with OE between the groups. CONCLUSION: Pilates exercises positively improved core muscle endurance and trunk balance in people infected with COVID-19, which will be reflected in their quality of movement patterns and quality of life."

      "abstract": "The paradigm of comprehensive treatment approaches for children with cerebral palsy has gained traction, prompting clinicians to deliberate between independent and integrated treatment delivery. However, this decision-making process is often hindered by the dearth of empirical evidence available to inform optimal therapeutic strategies. This study, therefore, sought to compare the effects of Pilates-based core strengthening (PsCS), plyometric-based muscle loading (PlyoML), and their combination on postural control, balance, and mobility in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (ULCP). Eighty-one children with ULCP (age: 12-18 years) were randomized to PsCS (n = 27), PlyoML (n = 27), or a combined intervention (n = 27; equated for total sets/repetitions) group. The three interventions were applied twice/week over 12 successive weeks. Postural control (directional and overall limits of stability-LoS), balance, and mobility (Community Balance and Mobility Scale-CB&M; Functional Walking Test-FWT; Timed Up and Down Stair test-TUDS) were assessed pre- and post-intervention. The combined group exhibited greater increases in directional LoS compared to PsCS and PlyoML including the backward (p = 0.006 and 0.033, respectively), forward (p = 0.015 and 0.036, respectively), paretic (p = 0.017 and 0.018, respectively), and non-paretic directions (p = 0.006 and 0.004, respectively)], and this was also the case for overall LoS (p < 0.001 versus PsCS and PlyoML). In addition, the combined group displayed greater improvements compared to the PsCS and PlyoML groups regarding CB&M (p = 0.037 and p = 0.002, respectively), FWT (p = 0.012 and p = 0.038, respectively), and TUDS (p = 0.046 and p = 0.021, respectively). In conclusion, the combined PsCS and PlyoML exercise program promotes considerably greater improvements in postural control, balance, and mobility compared to unimodal training in children with ULCP."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pilates is becoming increasingly popular amongst a wide range of people and is gaining more attention. It is also an effective means of physical rehabilitation. The aim of this systematic review is to explore the effects of Pilates on spinal deformity and posture. METHOD: This systematic review was conducted using four recognised academic and scientific databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed and Cochrane) to identify articles that met the inclusion criteria. The secondary search used the Google Scholar and the Science Direct search engines. The search for articles for this review began in July 06, 2023 and was concluded on February 01, 2024. The search process for this study was documented using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020). The PEDro scale was used to assess the internal validity and data statistics of the studies included in this systematic review and to evaluate the quality of the studies. RESULTS: The systematic review included nine studies that met the inclusion criteria from the 651 studies retrieved, involving a total of 643 participants. The PEDro scale scores of the studies included in this systematic review ranged from 3 to 8. The intervention was in the form of Pilates or Pilates combined exercises. The studies included in this review used outcome measures of Cobb angle, angle of trunk rotation (ATR), range of motion (ROM), chest expansion, Scoliosis Research Society Questionnaire (SRS-22r) and postural assessment. Research has shown that Pilates is effective in correcting spinal deformities and posture, as well as improving quality of life, pain relief, function and fitness. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provide substantial evidence that Pilates has a positive impact on improving spinal deformity and posture. However, more research is needed to validate whether Pilates can be used effectively as a physical therapy for spinal deformity rehabilitation. Pilates has considerable potential for public health interventions."

Objective of this manuscript was to systematically review the literature about the effects of Pilates on depressive disorders. A bibliographic search was conducted in the main database sources (Pubmed, Medline, and Scopus). The inclusion criteria consisted of articles written in English language about the effectiveness of Pilates on depressive symptoms. Most of included studies are randomized controlled trials (10 out of 12). The available literature agrees in indicating that Pilates is effective in improving depressive symptoms especially when compared to inactivity and when this practice is administered for a medium-long period (8-16 weeks). In addition, Pilates seems to have at least comparable effectiveness than aerobic exercise. Pilates can be considered a reliable complementary treatment for people with depressive disorders. These findings should be interpreted considering the different types of practice administered as well as the different duration of the programs or rating scales used to assess mood symptoms. Studies with a more homogenous design are needed to confirm and make generalizable the results presented in this review.",

New exercise techniques can be effective in improving training. The aim of this study was to compare the effects on the strength and physical posture of a group practicing Pilates with another not practicing Pilates, both undergoing continuous football training. In this controlled randomized clinical trial, the participants were 15 soccer club members, who had a training frequency of least three times weekly. The sample was divided into a control group (n = 7) of players who did not undergo any therapeutic intervention (only the usual training) and a Pilates group (n = 8) of players who participated in the mat Pilates program. The intervention consisted of fifteen sessions. Postural evaluations were performed using biophotogrammetry and force analysis. Significant improvements were obtained in terms of increased muscle strength (p = 0.001) for the Pilates group, but there were no significant postural alterations when comparing the two groups. Five weeks of mat Pilates was sufficient to increase lower limb muscle strength in young football players. This pilot study indicates that Mat Pilates as a method that could be planned to be included in training.",

METHODS: Forty postmenopausal women were randomly divided in to two groups: PFMT (n = 20) and Pilates (n = 20). The participants were followed for 12 weeks, three times a week on nonconsecutive days. UI was assessed using the pad test and the voiding diary, PFM strength and resistance using bidigital assessment and manometry, and the impact of UI on quality of life using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF), before and after the 3-month treatment. RESULTS: There was a significant intra-group improvement in both groups for the pad test, mean daily urinary loss, and ICIQ-SF. The strength was significantly improved only in the PFMT group, and the endurance in both groups. Peak strength manometry was significantly improved only in the Pilates group, and the mean strength manometry in both groups. There was also an improvement in both groups for peak endurance manometry and mean endurance manometry. In the inter-group comparison, there was a significant improvement only in muscle strength, which was positive for group. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference between Pilates and PFMT for the management of women in post-menopause with stress urinary incontinence, provided that voluntary contraction of the PFMs is performed. However, further randomized clinical trials need to be carried out.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The scientific literature questions the impact of stretching exercises performed immediately before muscle strengthening exercises on different components of musculoskeletal physical fitness. Pilates is a physical exercise modality that typically uses stretching exercises preceding muscle-strengthening exercises. However, no studies have investigated the effects of stretching in a Pilates program on components of musculoskeletal fitness. The aim of the present study was to verify the effects of stretching in a Pilates exercise program on flexibility, strength, vertical jump height and muscular endurance. METHODS: Thirty-two sedentary young women were randomized into two groups: traditional Pilates (TP), who performed flexibility and muscle strengthening exercises (n = 16), and nontraditional Pilates (NTP), who only performed muscle-strengthening exercises (n = 16). Sessions took place 3 times a week for 8 weeks. The following tests were performed pre- and postintervention: 10-RM knee extensors, vertical jump, handgrip, 1-min sit-ups, Sorensen and sit-and-reach. The occurrence of adverse events was recorded throughout the intervention and compared between groups using odds ratio (OR). To compare the results of motor tests between groups, ANCOVA or Mann‒Whitney U test was used for parametric and nonparametric data, respectively. The data were analyzed by intention-to-treat. RESULTS: After intervention, the TP was superior to NTP for the sit-and-reach test, with a large effect size (d = 0.87; p = 0.035), with no differences between groups for the other tests. Intragroup comparisons showed significant differences (p < 0.05) for TP and NTP for improvement in 10-RM knee extensors and vertical jump measurements, while only TP showed significant intragroup improvement (p < 0.05) for the sit-and-reach test. A greater chance of experiencing pain or other discomfort as a result of exercise was shown by NTP (OR = 4.20, CI95% 0.69 to 25.26). CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that stretching exercises performed at the beginning of sessions in a Pilates program did not impair or enhance the development of strength, vertical jump height and muscular endurance in young women. However, only the Pilates program with stretching improved flexibility and reduced the chances of adverse events such as musculoskeletal pain and other discomfort resulting from the exercise protocol.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common genetic disorder of the endocrine gland among females during the age of reproduction with an estimated prevalence ranging from 2.2 % to 26 %. It is a typical reason for ovulatory infertility, menstrual dysfunction, and hirsutism. It is a condition in which ovarian cysts develop with a diameter of between two and nine millimeters on one or each ovaries and therefore there is an increase in the volume of one is larger than ten millimeters. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effect of pilates on pain and regulation of the menstrual cycle in females with PCOS. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: A single centered, quasi-experimental study, performed in Lovely Professional University, India on a total of 26 participants suffering from PCOS, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. After a detailed assessment, the Pilates exercise protocol was given for 3 months i.e. 3 times per week. The readings for pain and regulation were taken at baseline, at the end of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd month using visual analog scale (VAS)and verbal multidimensional score sysem (VMSS). RESULTS: The result findings indicates suggested that there is significant change in the pain (Wilk's Lambda =.117, F(3,23) = 58.109, P < 0.05), variable during the menstruation in PCOS over the time of three months. The menstrual cycles were regularised and the cycle was shifted towards the normal parameters. The VMSS also shows changes that signify that Pilates is effective in PCOS complications. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that Pilates is effective in reducing the pain in PCOS cases which improves the working ability of the females and also regulates the menstrual cycles which were irregular at the beginning of the treatment."

We aimed to evaluate the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with Pilates-based exercises compared with sham stimulation on pain, quality of life and disability in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a protocol for a double-blind randomised controlled trial with participants, outcome assessor and statistician blinded. We will include 36 individuals with a history of non-specific chronic low back pain for more than 12 weeks and minimum pain intensity of 3 points on the Numerical Pain Rating Scale. Individuals will be randomised into two groups: (1) active tDCS combined with Pilates-based exercises and (2) sham tDCS combined with Pilates-based exercises. Three weekly sessions of the protocol will be provided for 4 weeks, and individuals will be submitted to three assessments: the first (T0) will be performed before the intervention protocol, the second (T1) immediately after the intervention protocol and the third (T2) will be a follow-up 1 month after the end of the intervention. We will assess pain, disability, central sensitisation, quality of life, pressure pain threshold, global impression of change, adverse events and medication use. The Numerical Pain Rating Scale and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire will be used at T1 to assess pain and disability, respectively, as primary outcome measures. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial was prospectively registered in ClinicalTrials.gov website and ethically approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences of Trairi (report number: 5.411.244) before data collection. We will publish the results in a peer-reviewed medical journal and on institution websites. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05467566).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pilates training intervention programs have gained attention as a potential approach to enhancing balance in older adults, thereby reducing the risk of falls. In light of these considerations, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to critically evaluate the existing evidence and determine the effect of Pilates training intervention programs on older adults' balance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The literature was searched through the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases from inception until July 2023. The primary keywords used for the literature search included \"elderly\" or \"older adults\" and \"pilates training\" and \"balance\". RESULTS: The systematic review through qualitative analysis showed robust evidence about the efficacy of Pilates intervention programs in improving older adults' balance. The pooled meta-analysis of static and dynamic balance showed that eight (53%) out of a total fifteen analyzed interventions presented a significant effect of Pilates in improving the participants' balance, without between-study heterogeneity. In addition, the meta-analysis regarding dynamic balance showed that six (67%) out of nine analyzed interventions presented a significant effect of Pilates in improving the participants' balance, without heterogeneity between studies. Similarly, the meta-analysis regarding static balance showed that four (50%) out of eight analyzed studies presented significant effects on the older adults' balance, where moderate between-study heterogeneity was found. Sensitivity analysis showed that three studies reduced the between-study heterogeneity (19, 17.6, and 17%), regressing from moderate to low heterogeneity, p < 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis underscores the potential of Pilates training as a valuable intervention to enhance balance in the elderly population."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pilates is expected to have a positive effect on women with weakened abdominal muscles after childbirth. Pilates may have a beneficial effect on the structure and function of the abdominal muscles in pregnant women. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of Pilates on inter-recti distance, thickness of the rectus abdominis, waist circumference, and abdominal muscle endurance in primiparous women. METHODS: Thirty-five primiparous postpartum women were assigned to either the Pilates exercise group (n = 20) or the control group (n = 15). Pilates was undertaken by the exercise group for 50 min/day, 5 days/week, for 4 weeks. The control group maintained their daily activities without any intervention. The inter-recti distance was measured at three locations along the linea alba, and the thickness of the rectus abdominis was measured using ultrasound. Abdominal muscle endurance was measured using a repeated 1-min curl-up test. Waist circumference was also measured. RESULTS: The exercise group showed significant improvements from baseline in inter-recti distance, waist circumference, and abdominal muscle endurance (p < 0.05). The control group showed no significant improvement in these variables. Compared with the control group, the exercise group showed significantly improved performance in terms of inter-recti distance, waist circumference, and abdominal muscle endurance (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that Pilates was effective in reducing inter-recti distance and waist circumference and improving abdominal muscle endurance in primiparous postpartum women. Pilates is considered an effective exercise for improving muscle structure and function in primiparous postpartum women, helping in the recovery from, and preventing, diastasis rectus abdominis.",

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the effect of Aqua Stretch and Aqua Pilates in improving quality of life (QOL), function, and pain in AS patients. METHODS: This study was conducted on 40 patients, who were randomly assigned to the Aqua Pilates, Aqua Stretch, and control groups. The experimental groups attended interventions for six-week. QOL, pain intensity, function, and fatigue were measured before and after treatments. RESULTS: Except for the chest expanding, all variables in the Aqua Stretch group changed significantly after six weeks (p< 0.05). QOL (p= 0.002), 6MWT (p= 0.016), and Schober flexion (p= 0.011) showed changes, while BASDAI (p= 0.0001), VAS (p= 0.0001), fatigue (p= 0.0001), and Schober extension (p= 0.028) showed significant decreases. Except for chest expansion and Schober extension, which did not alter significantly after six-week of Aqua Pilates (p> 0.05), all other variables did. There was an increasing trend in 6MWT and Schober flexion (p= 0.021) and a decreasing trend in BASDAI (p= 0.002), VAS (p= 0.0001) and fatigue (p= 0.002). Except for QOL (p= 0.016), no statistically significant differences were found between the groups. CONCLUSION: All variables had a significant change after six-week Aqua Stretch, except for the chest expanding. Chest expanding and Schober extension were the variables which had no significant change after six-week Aqua Pilates. With the exception of QOL, no statistically significant differences were found between the groups. Aqua Stretch had the greatest effect on the VAS, as measured by the minimum clinically relevant differences (MCID). Moreover, in Aqua Stretch alone, there was a notable impact on fatigue, QOL, and the BASDAI.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pilates-mat is an effective training method to enhance several physiological and fitness parameters, although the effects of pilates-mat detraining on body composition and physical fitness remains largely unknown. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of pilates-mat training and detraining on body composition and physical fitness in pilates-trained females. METHODS: Twenty females (age: 45.1 ± 8.7 years) followed an 8-week pilates-mat training program followed by a 3-week detraining period. Measurements performed at the beginning of the training intervention, at the end of the 8-week training program and at the end of the 3-week detraining period and included: anthropometric characteristics, body composition analysis, thigh, hip and waist circumferences, blood pressure, heart rate at rest (HRr), maximum handgrip strength, abdominal curls, lower body flexibility and aerobic capacity. RESULTS: Pilates-mat training significantly decreased body fat percentage (BF%), visceral fat and HRr (p < 0.05) but these variables returned to baseline after detraining. Trunk fat, thigh and waist circumferences decreased significantly after training and remained significantly low following detraining (p < 0.05). Abdominal curls, lower body flexibility and aerobic capacity increased significantly following pilates-mat training and remained unchanged after detraining (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that 8 weeks of pilates-mat training enhanced body composition and physical fitness and these physiological and physical fitness benefits were remained unaltered during the 3-week of pilates-mat detraining period. However, BF% and visceral fat returned to baseline levels following the detraining period suggesting that for maintaining the reduction in BF% and visceral fat a long-period of pilates-mat detraining should be avoided.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Balance impairments are common in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), with reduced ability to maintain position and delayed responses to postural adjustments. Pilates is a popular alternative method for balance training that may reduce the rapid worsening of symptoms and the increased risk of secondary conditions (eg, depression) that are frequently associated with physical inactivity. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we aimed to describe the design, development, and usability testing of MS Fitness Intervention Training (MS-FIT), a Kinect-based tool implementing Pilates exercises customized for MS. METHODS: MS-FIT has been developed using a user-centered design approach (design, prototype, user feedback, and analysis) to gain the target user's perspective. A team composed of 1 physical therapist, 2 game programmers, and 1 game designer developed the first version of MS-FIT that integrated the knowledge and experience of the team with MS literature findings related to Pilates exercises and balance interventions based on exergames. MS-FIT, developed by using the Unity 3D (Unity Technologies) game engine software with Kinect Sensor V2 for Windows, implements exercises for breathing, posture, and balance. Feedback from an Italian panel of experts in MS rehabilitation (neurologists, physiatrists, physical therapists, 1 statistician, and 1 bioengineer) and people with MS was collected to customize the tool for use in MS. The context of MS-FIT is traveling around the world to visit some of the most important cities to learn the aspects of their culture through pictures and stories. At each stay of the travel, the avatar of a Pilates teacher shows the user the exercises to be performed. Overall, 9 people with MS (n=4, 44% women; mean age 42.89, SD 11.97 years; mean disease duration 10.19, SD 9.18 years; Expanded Disability Status Scale score 3.17, SD 0.75) were involved in 3 outpatient user test sessions of 30 minutes; MS-FIT's usability was assessed through an ad hoc questionnaire (maximum value=5; higher the score, higher the usability) evaluating easiness to use, playability, enjoyment, satisfaction, and acceptance. RESULTS: A user-centered design approach was used to develop an accessible and challenging tool for balance training. All people with MS (9/9, 100%) completed the user test sessions and answered the ad hoc questionnaire. The average score on each item ranged from 3.78 (SD 0.67) to 4.33 (SD 1.00), which indicated a high usability level. The feedback and suggestions provided by 64% (9/14) of people with MS and 36% (5/14) of therapists involved in the user test were implemented to refine the first prototype to release MS-FIT 2.0. CONCLUSIONS: The participants reported that MS-FIT was a usable tool. It is a promising system for enhancing the motivation and engagement of people with MS in performing exercise with the aim of improving their physical status."

AIM: To examine the effects of a 10-week mat-Pilates program on pain, disability, and balance in older women with chronic NSLBP. METHODS: Sixty-three women (≥ 65 years) with chronic NSLBP were randomly assigned to intervention (IG) or control (CG) groups. IG received individualized mat-Pilates sessions (45 min, twice weekly), while CG followed a home-based general exercise program. Primary outcomes included visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), timed up-and-go (TUG), and Berg Balance Scale (BBS) at baseline, 10 weeks, and 6 months post-intervention. Repeated measures multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was used, adjusted for exercise adherence and analgesic use. RESULTS: IG significantly improved in VAS and RMDQ scores at 10 weeks and 6 months (p > 0.05). No significant differences were observed in TUG and BBS scores at any measurement point. No between-group differences were found in analgesic use or adherence to exercise during the 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: A 10-week mat-Pilates program reduced pain and improved disability in older women with chronic NSLBP, effects which persisted at 6 months. However, no impact on balance, analgesic use, or exercise adherence was observed. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER/DATE OF REGISTRATION: NCT04752579/February 12, 2021.",

Hysterectomy is associated with a number of complications; hence, early mobilization and physiotherapy are necessary following surgery. This is a case report of a 45-year-old female who presented with complaints of abdominal pain associated with white discharge. Investigations showed an anterior submucosal fibroid measuring 3.2x2.7 cm and the patient underwent an abdominal hysterectomy. Early mobilization and physiotherapy were started on Day 6, which included breathing exercises, upper limb mobility, lower limb mobility, and positioning and postural advice. Yoga and pilates therapy were integrated into the protocol starting from the second week. The patient attended 30 days of therapy in two phases and was advised to continue even after discharge. We concluded that this unique approach of including pilates and yoga showed a positive impact on the patient's condition in terms of her quality of life, strength, endurance, and power, even decreasing her difficulty in performing activities of daily living."

These individuals were randomly divided into a face-to-face Pilates group (FPG), an online Pilates group (OPG), and a control group (CG). The FPG and OPG performed a 60-min mat Pilates program with a Borg scale of 11-17, three times a week for 12 weeks. The participants in the CG maintained their daily routines. Body composition, mechanical muscle properties, cardiometabolic parameters, mental health, and physical fitness were assessed before and after 12 weeks of intervention. No significant differences in body composition or cardiometabolic parameters were observed between groups. However, the FPG and OPG showed greater improvements than the CG in terms of muscle mechanical properties, cardiometabolic parameters, mental health, and physical fitness. In addition, the FPG showed greater improvement than the OPG. In conclusion, face-to-face Pilates is a more effective modality than online Pilates, although both modalities improve health-related parameters."

METHODS: This review used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) criteria for the selection, reading, and analysis of studies in this area. We searched five literature databases (Web of Science, SCOPUS, library catalog of the Faculty of Sport and Physical Education of the University of Coimbra-EBSCO Discovery Services, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar). Eligible articles contained the word \"Pilates,\" and the human movement variability was analyzed. Any type of study (except reviews) could be eligible and must have been published between 1 January 2002 and 30 November 2022, in Portuguese, Spanish, French, or English. RESULTS: Our search identified five eligible entries. Only one study used the Pilates method in its intervention, pointing to a more significant variability of hip-knee coordination, suggesting more diversified coordination patterns, and maintaining the variability of the angular position of the joint. CONCLUSION: Very few studies have examined movement variability in Pilates, and only one applied an ecological framework."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the single-blinded randomized controlled study conducted between January 2018 and June 2018, 34 pregnant women (mean age: 29.7±6.2 years; range, 18 to 40 years) in the second trimester (week 14-24) with LPP were randomly assigned to a control group and a Pilates group. All patients underwent usual prenatal care. In addition, the selected Pilates exercise was carried out twice a week for 60-min per session for 12 weeks in the Pilates group. The control group was not prescribed an exercise regimen; however, they were not discouraged from exercising. The primary outcome was disability; secondary outcomes were LPP, mood, and sleep quality. Disability [Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ)], LPP [Visual Analog Scale (VAS)], mood [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Anxiety (HADS-A) and Depression (HADS-D) subscales], and sleep quality [Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)] were measured before and after 12 weeks. Adverse effects and adherence were recorded to determine exercise safety and compliance. The intention-to-treat analysis was applied. RESULTS: The between-group effect sizes were moderate for the RMDQ and VAS scales (d=0.4 and d=0.7, respectively) and small for the HADS-A and HADS-D scales (both d=0.2). The intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated that there was a statistically significant difference in disability, pain, and mood in favor of the Pilates group (p0.05). CONCLUSION: Adding Pilates to usual prenatal care should be considered a promising treatment option for pregnancy-related LPP."

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effectiveness of Pilates exercise on pain intensity and functional disability caused by low back pain (LBP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted. Data sources: MEDLINE-NLM and MEDLINE-EBSCO. We also searched on Scopus Elsevier, Cochrane, DOAJ, SciELO, PEDro, and PLOS ONE databases. Eligibility criteria: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating LBP in which the primary treatment was based on Pilates exercise compared with no exercise, or non-specific exercise. RESULTS: The search returned 1566 records of which 36 articles were included in the systematic review and 19 in the meta-analysis. Twenty-two studies compared the effects of Pilates exercise vs no exercise and 13 studies examined the effects of Pilates exercise vs non-specific exercise. Analysis showed that Pilates had a positive effect on the perception of LBP vs no exercise. A similar trend occurred with non-specific exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Pilates exercise can decrease LBP compared to no exercise and non-specific exercise. General practitioners should consider Pilates exercise as an effective strategy to manage LBP and counteract the growing health.

OBJECTIVES: This research aimed to assess the effect of adding laser acupuncture therapy (LAT) to a Pilates exercise program (PEP) and low-calorie diet protocol (LCDP) on blood lipids among 60 obese women with SLE. METHODS: Study participants were women aged between 23 and 49 years, randomly assigned to one of two groups, A or B, each comprising 30 women. In addition to adherence to the LCDP, both groups were supervised five times weekly during 50-minute PEP sessions. Group A also received LAT three times weekly, with each session lasting 2 minutes on selected acupoints. After the 12-week intervention, plasma total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein were assessed. RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in the aforementioned lipids after the 12-week intervention. A comparison between the post-intervention values of the lipids in the groups revealed a significant improvement favoring group A (the group that received LAT). CONCLUSION: Adding a 12-week LAT regimen to PEP and LCDP significantly improved lipid profiles among 60 obese women with SLE.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exercise and self-awareness are popular in the management of people with MS (pwMS). The combination of these techniques for diminishing mental and cognitive imparements doesn't apply. Since the capacity to monitor one's mind and maintain balance and efficient mobility is fundamental for carrying out the daily affairs of pwMS, in this study we assess the effect of Pilates Suspension with Self-awareness on Gait and Metacognition of pwMS. We also evaluate whether metacognition is trainable and, if so, which component of self-awareness (mental and physical) would be instrumental in this improvement. METHOD: Twenty-four female PwMS who scored 2-6.5 on the EDSS were homogeneously divided into two intervention groups [one received pilates suspension training (PST) with Benson relaxation (PSBR), and the other received PST with Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation (PSJR)] and one control group for 7 consecutive weeks. Relaxation training was used as a means to self-awareness. Due to the coronavirus pandemic around the world during the research process, baseline and postintervention tests and training sessions were held online. Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) and Metacognition Questionnaire-30 (MCQ-30), outcome measures were collected before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Analysis of group data revealed significant improvement between baseline and intervention phases for Dynamic Gate Index (p = 0.002 for Benson relaxation and p = 0.001 for Jacobson's progressive muscle) and Metacognition Questionnaire-30 (p = 0.02 for Benson relaxation and p = 0.002 for Jacobson's progressive muscle). CONCLUSIONS: With regard to multidimensional disorders of pwMS, a combined training protocol is recommended for pwMS.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of Pilates on menstrual pain and symptoms, premenstrual syndrome, and risk factors of dysmenorrhea. Thirty young women with primary dysmenorrhea were randomly assigned into a Pilates group (PG; n = 15) and a waitlist control group (CG; n = 15). The Pilates was performed twice a week for 12 weeks. Menstrual pain and symptoms were measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Cox menstrual symptom scale (CMSS), respectively. Premenstrual syndrome was assessed using the premenstrual symptoms screening tool (PSST). Additionally, back flexibility, hip muscle strength, sleep duration and quality, perceived stress, state-trait anxiety, and depression were evaluated. The VAS, CMSS severity and frequency, and PSST symptoms and functional impairments decreased in the PG compared to the CG (p < 0.001 or p < 0.01) with large effect sizes. Back flexibility and the strength of hip flexors, hip extensors, and hip abductors significantly increased in the PG compared to the CG (all p < 0.01) with large effect sizes. Sleep quality (p < 0.01) and stress (p < 0.05) improved in the PG. Sleep duration, anxiety, and depression did not change in either group. In conclusion, the 12-week Pilates intervention ameliorates dysmenorrhea, partly mediated by improved physical function and sleep quality."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Gait disorders in individuals with Parkinson's disease (IwPD) are among the most disabling symptoms. Physical exercise has been proposed for the treatment of IwPD because it shows positive effects on gait variables. Given the importance of physical activity in the rehabilitation process of IwPD, the assessment of interventions to identify those most promising for improving or maintaining gait performance is of great relevance. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of Mat Pilates Training (MPT) and Multicomponent Training (MCT) on the spatiotemporal variables of gait in situations of daily dual-task performance in IwPD. Gait analysis in a daily dual-task context allows the simulation of real-life conditions where individuals have a higher risk of falling than in single-task walking. METHODS: We conducted a single-blinded randomized controlled trial with 34 mild-to-moderate IwPD (Hoehn-Yahr stage 1-2). They were randomized to one of two interventions: MPT or MCT. All participants performed the training for 60 min, three times per week, for 20 weeks. Spatiotemporal gait variables were evaluated in a daily life situation to increase the ecological validity of the measurements, which included gait speed, stride time, double support time, swing time, and cadence. The individuals walked on a platform holding two bags with a load corresponding to 10% of their body mass. RESULTS: After the intervention, there was a significant improvement in gait speed in both groups: MPT (p = 0.047) and MCT (p = 0.015). The MPT group reduced the cadence (p = 0.005) and the MCT group increased the stride length (p = 0.026) after the intervention. DISCUSSION: Both groups had positive effects on gait speed with load transport resulting from the two proposed interventions. However, the MPT group showed a spatiotemporal adjustment of speed and cadence that can increase gait stability, which was not found in the MCT group.",

This condition increases with advancing pregnancy, interfering with work, daily activities and sleep. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of the Pilates method in comparison to prenatal care on the control of lower back pain in pregnant women. SEARCH METHODS: Electronic searches were carried out with no language or year of publication restriction in the databases Medline via Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, PEDro, and SPORTDiscus on 20 March 2021. The keywords \"Pilates\" and \"Pregnancy\" were applied and the search strategies, adapted to each databank. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized clinical trials with pregnant women with muscle pain symptoms and Pilates as an intervention method in comparison to conventional prenatal care were considered. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. The critical evaluation was done using the Risk of Bias tool assess the quality and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We conducted a meta-analysis for the main outcome \"pain\". RESULTS: through our searches, 687 papers were identified, but only two fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Only two studies compared Pilates with a control group without physical exercise for pain in the short term. In the meta-analysis, there was a significant difference for pain in the comparison between the Pilates group and the control group without exercise; the mean difference (MD) was -23.09 (95% CI), from -31.07 to -15.10, p = 0.001, for 65 individuals (33 in the Pilates group and 32 in the conventional group). Limitation found was the lack of blinding of therapists and participants and the small sample size of individual studies. In addition, no adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSION: There is moderate-quality evidence that Pilates exercise may reduce pregnancy-related low-back pain more than usual prenatal or no exercise. Prospero registration number CRD42021223243.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifactorial form of rheumatic condition contributing to physical and psychological factors. Treatments have been provided solely and often compared with each other. An alternative view is that combined treatments addressing physical and psychological factors may result in more benefits. This study aimed to investigate the effect of pain neuroscience education (PNE) followed by Pilates exercises (PEs) in participants with knee OA, compared to PE alone. METHODS: In this two-arm assessor-blind pilot randomized controlled trial, fifty-four community-dwelling adults with knee OA were randomly assigned to the PNE followed by PEs and PEs groups (27 in each group). The study was conducted between early July 2021 and early March 2022 at the university's health center. Primary outcomes were Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) subscales of pain and physical limitation and secondary outcomes were Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, and Timed \"Up & Go\" test covering function. The primary and secondary outcomes were measured at baseline and eight weeks post-treatment. A general linear mixed model was used for between-group comparison with a statistical significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: Significant within-group differences were observed in all outcomes in both groups at post-treatment. There were no statistically between-group differences in pain (adjusted mean difference: -0.8; 95% CI -2.2 to 0.7; p = 0.288), physical limitation (adjusted mean difference: -0.4; 95% CI -4 to 3.1; p = 0.812) and function (adjusted mean difference: -0.8; 95% CI -1.8 to 0.1; p = 0.069) at eight weeks. For pain catastrophizing (adjusted mean difference: -3.9; 95% CI -7.2 to -0.6; p = 0.021), kinesiophobia (adjusted mean difference: -4.2; 95% CI -8.1 to -0.4; p = 0.032), and self-efficacy (adjusted mean difference: 6.1; 95% CI 0.7 to 11.5; p = 0.028) statistically between-group improvements were observed favoring PNE followed by PEs group after the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Combining PNE with PEs could have superior effects on psychological characteristics but not on pain, physical limitation, and function, compared to PEs alone. This pilot study emphasizes the need to investigate the combined effects of different interventions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: IRCT20210701051754N1.",

DESIGN: This was a secondary causal mediation analysis of a four-arm randomised controlled trial testing Pilates exercise dosage (once, twice or thrice per week) against a booklet control. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and fifty-five people with chronic low back pain. DATA ANALYSIS: All analyses were conducted in R software (version 4.1.2) following a preregistered analysis plan. A directed acyclic graph was constructed to identify potential pre-treatment mediator-outcome confounders. For each mediator model, we estimated the intervention-mediator effect, the mediator-outcome effect, the total natural indirect effect (TNIE), the pure natural direct effect (PNDE), and the total effect (TE). RESULTS: Pain catastrophising mediated the effect of Pilates exercise compared with control on the outcomes pain intensity (TNIE MD -0.21, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.03) and physical function (TNIE MD -0.64, 95% CI -1.20 to -0.18). Kinesiophobia mediated the effect of Pilates exercise compared with control on the outcomes pain intensity (TNIE MD -0.31, 95% CI -0.68 to -0.02) and physical function (TNIE MD -1.06, 95% CI -1.70 to -0.49). The proportion mediated by each mediator was moderate (21 to 55%). CONCLUSION: Reductions in pain catastrophising and kinesiophobia partially mediated the pathway to improved pain intensity and physical function when using Pilates exercise for chronic low back pain. These psychological components may be important treatment targets for clinicians and researchers to consider when prescribing exercise for chronic low back pain.",

Additionally, assess the adherence and adverse effects of Mat Pilates sessions and the association of the level of physical activity with severe fatigue symptoms. METHODS: One hundred fifty-six patients with non-metastatic breast cancer were randomized to usual care or supervised Mat Pilates exercise. Fatigue and physical activity level were measured at baseline, end of RT, 30 days, 3 and 6 months after RT. The generalized estimating equation (GEE) with intention to treat was applied. RESULTS: A significant difference in the fatigue mean between the end of RT and the baseline was found in patients of both groups. There was no adverse effect with the practice of Mat Pilates, and it was analyzed the reduction of the symptom pain after the end of RT in women of intervention group compared to the control. There was no significant effect on fatigue between the groups. Patients with severe fatigue after 3 and 6 months of RT reported a significantly lower level of physical activity in the last periods. CONCLUSION: Fatigue levels increased at the end of RT but returned to baseline values after 6 months. A lower level of physical activity was associated with severe fatigue symptoms. Mat Pilates was safe for these women and reduced the symptom pain after treatment, but it did not successfully reduce fatigue during adjuvant RT. REGISTRATION: NCT03333993.

Pilates is argued to improve movement and reduce pain, yet there is a limited understanding of the specific effects of Pilates training on core muscle strength or activity. A systematic search of databases (CINAHL, Embase, Ovid MEDLINE) used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methods to evaluate randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of Pilates to improve core muscle activation. Methodological quality was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale (PEDro). The certainty of findings was determined using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool. Of the initial yield of 563 articles, eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria. A diverse range of Pilates interventions and outcome measures were utilised to assess effects on core muscle activation and strength. The main finding was that Pilates is not inferior to equivalently dosed exercises, and can be superior to non-equivalent or no exercise, for improving core muscle strength as indicated by muscle thickness. There was emerging evidence that Pilates positively impacts core muscle strength and can be an effective intervention for people living with chronic low back pain."

On the other hand, there is insufficient information about whether similar benefits can be achieved with Pilates-based telerehabilitation (Pilates-TR). We aimed to investigate the effects of Pilates-TR on physical performance and QOL in PwMS. METHODS: Thirty PwMS were recruited and randomly allocated into two groups. The Pilates-TR group received Pilates-TR via videoconferences three days per week during six weeks at home. The control group (CG) was a waitlist with no Pilates-TR treatment. Physical performance measures included extremity muscle strength, core endurance and power, balance, gait analysis, and functional exercise capacity. In addition, fatigue and QOL were evaluated. RESULTS: Extremity muscle strength, core endurance and power, balance, walking speed, cadence, distance, functional exercise capacity, and QOL were improved after Pilates-TR (p < 0.05). Fatigue level and the effects of fatigue on functions decreased in Pilates-TR, while fatigue level increased in CG (p < .05). The CG showed no changes in any other measurements (p > .05). CONCLUSION: Pilates-TR was effective in improving physical performance and QOL in PwMS. Pilates-TR can be recommended as an effective option, especially for patients with barriers to reaching the clinic. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04838886).",

      "abstract": "Corporate wellness has become an important public health priority through the designing and implementation of different workplace exercise interventions. The objectives of this study were to investigate: (a) the effectiveness of a 4-month workplace combined yoga, Pilates, and circuit strength training program (outside work shift) on health indices, functional capacity, and physical fitness in office employees; and (b) the employees' enjoyment following the program. Fifty physically active office employees (26-55 years old) were equally divided into training (TG) and control groups (CG). The TG followed a 4-month (3 times/week, 50-60 min/training) combined yoga, Pilates, and circuit strength training program. Health indices (body composition, body mass, circumferences, musculoskeletal pains), functional capacity (flexibility, balance), and physical fitness (strength, aerobic capacity) were measured before and after the 4-month time period. After the completion of the program, the TG participants' enjoyment was assessed. The TG significantly improved (p < 0.001) all health, functional capacity (11.3-82.0%), and physical fitness indices (33.9%), except for aerobic capacity, which did not change (p > 0.05). Furthermore, a great percentage of employees (84%) reported high levels of enjoyment. This program could be effectively and safely used in workplace settings as an enjoyable intervention to improve specific health, functional capacity, and physical fitness indices in office employees."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aims to investigate the effect of Pilates exercises on sleep and fatigue among female college students residing in the dormitory. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study, two parallel groups was performed on 80 single female college students (40 per group), between 18 to 26 years old who lived in the two dormitories. One dormitory was considered as the intervention group and another as the control group. The Pilates group received three one-hour Pilates exercise sessions per week for eight weeks and the control group maintained their routine activities. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) were used respectively to assess sleep quality and fatigue levels, at three time points: baseline, end of week four, and eight follow-ups. Fisher's exact, Chi-square, independent sample t-test and repeated measurements were used. RESULTS: Overall, 66 participants completed the study (32 and 35 participants in the Pilates and control groups, respectively). After four and eight weeks of intervention, the overall mean score of sleep quality improved significantly (p < 0.001). At week four of the intervention, the Pilates group had a significantly lower mean score for subjective sleep quality and daytime dysfunction than the control group (p < 0.001 and p < 0.002, respectively), although sleep duration and habitual sleep efficiency improved after eight weeks of intervention (p < 0.04 and p < 0.034, respectively). Additionally, the overall mean score of fatigue and its dimensions in weeks four and eight of the intervention in the Pilates group were significantly lower compared to the control group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: After eight weeks of Pilates exercises implementation, most components of sleep quality significantly improved; however, the effect of Pilates exercises on fatigue was evident from week four onward.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To summarize the evidence of associations between Pilates and multiple health outcomes, and evaluate the strength and validity of these associations. DESIGN: Unbrella review. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to February, 2023. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews, version 2 and the certainty of evidence was graded by the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluations. We recalculated each outcome using random-effects models with standardized mean difference. RESULTS: We identified 27 systematic reviews with meta-analyses in this umbrella review. 1 was rated as high quality, 1 as moderate quality, 15 as low quality, and 10 as critically low quality. These studies focused on the populations with diseases of the circulatory system, endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases, genitourinary system diseases, mental, behavioral, or neurodevelopmental disorder, musculoskeletal system diseases, neoplasms, nervous system diseases, sleep-wake function disorder and others. Compared with inactive/active intervention, Pilates can reduce body mass index and body fat percentage, relieve pain and disability, and improve sleep quality and balance. The certainty of evidence was very low to moderate for these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Pilates showed benefits on several health outcomes related with low back pain, neck pain and scoliosis. However, the certainty of the evidence was mostly low; further high quality randomized controlled trials are needed to elucidate and support these promising findings.",

      "abstract": "Chronic nonspecific low back pain (CNLBP) is the most common musculoskeletal condition, which can be influenced by nociceptive, psychosocial, cognitive, and affective aspects, causing vulnerabilities and impairing the individual's ability to manage pain. The association of continuous shortwave diathermy (CSWD) with Pilates-based exercises may contribute to reduce pain, depression, and anxiety in patients with CNLBP. A single-blind randomized clinical trial was performed in which 36 patients with CNLBP were divided into a control group that received placebo CSWD and an intervention group that received active CSWD. Both groups received 12 sessions of Pilates-based exercises. Pain, depression, and anxiety variables were evaluated using the McGill questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Visual Analog Anxiety Scale. Assessments were performed at baseline, after three and six weeks of treatment, and at the three-month follow-up. The Shapiro-Wilk test, Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, chi-squared test, and repeated measures ANOVA, with α=0.05, were used to compare the outcomes, and indicated that active CSWD did not present additional improvement in the assessed variables in CNLBP patients compared to the placebo group. Both groups improved pain and depression at follow-up and reduced anxiety only during Pilates-based exercises. Therefore, only Pilates-based exercises seemed sufficient to manage patients with CNLBP.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of Pilates exercise (PE) with other forms of exercise on pain and disability in individuals with chronic non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP) and to inform clinical practice and future research. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis conducted and reported in line the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-analysis. LITERATURE SEARCH: Six electronic databases were searched from inception to April 2021. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effect of PE with other forms of exercise for adults with CNSLBP on pain and disability. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers assessed the risk of bias of the trials, guided by the Cochrane RoB2 tool. Available data were extracted for meta-analysis with subgroup analysis. Pilates exercise was compared to general exercise (GE), direction-specific exercise (DSE) and spinal stabilisation exercise (SSE). Certainty of evidence was interpreted following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. RESULTS: Eleven RCTs were included. A low certainty of evidence supported PE was more effective than GE in pain reduction [Effect size (ES) 0.44]. Moreover, very low levels of certainty were revealed for effectiveness of PE compared with DSE for pain reduction (ES 0.65) and equivalence of PE and SSE for pain and disability. CONCLUSIONS: This review found no strong evidence for using one type of exercise intervention over another when managing patients with CNSLBP. Existing evidence does not allow this review to draw definitive recommendations. In the absence of a superior exercise form clinicians should work collaboratively with the patient, using the individual's goals and preferences to guide exercise selection. Further appropriately designed research is warranted to explore this topic further.",
