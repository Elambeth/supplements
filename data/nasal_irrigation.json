      "abstract": "Rhinitis is an extremely common disease, to the extent that it actually affects the entire population throughout its lifetime. Rhinitis can be classified according to the etiopathogenetic mechanisms involved. Regarding the cause, rhinitis can be infectious, allergic, non-allergic, secondary to other diseases and iatrogenic. In clinical practice, two main pathophysiological mechanisms cause an alteration in nasal physiology: nasal obstruction and mucus overproduction. Nasal obstruction can be due to two main causes, which are acute infection and allergy. Topical nasal therapy is the safest and most effective modality to rapidly achieve normal nasal patency. In particular, the paradigmatic modality of local therapy is nasal lavage, better defined as nasal irrigation. Nasal irrigation is an actual washing of the nasal cavity to remove excess mucus, inflammatory cells, mediators, cytokines, pathogens and all harmful substances. A recent Intersocietal Delphi Consensus was conducted in order to reach agreement on several aspects of topical nasal therapies. In this regard, a recent randomized controlled trial showed that a product containing PEG, bicarbonates and sodium chloride, administered to a group of patients with rhinitis or rhinosinusitis through a squeezable bottle was able to significantly reduce the intensity of symptoms and their impact on daily life. In conclusion, nasal irrigation can be considered a valid treatment option in the management of upper airway disorders. At the same time, it is important that more physicians become aware of the usefulness of this therapeutic method.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite having marginal beneficial effects, antibiotics are routinely prescribed in adults with acute sinusitis. Alternative interventions for this common condition are urgently needed. AIM: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of saline nasal irrigation for acute sinusitis. DESIGN & SETTING: Randomised controlled pilot trial with nested process evaluation in 24 English general practices between October 2019 and May 2021. METHOD: Participants were randomised to advice to high volume hypertonic saline nasal irrigation with a delayed antibiotic prescription or usual care. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment and follow-up rates, adherence, and acceptability of the intervention. RESULTS: Of those invited, 81/107 (76%) consented and were randomised (42 intervention, 39 usual care). Two participants were excluded due to ineligibility. Antibiotic prescribing strategies were recorded at baseline for 79/79 (100%), with no or delayed antibiotics prescribed in 60% (24/40) of the saline group versus 38% (15/39) of the usual care group. At follow-up, 80% (63/79) of participants recorded whether they consumed antibiotics or not. Among those from the intervention group who returned a symptom diary, 96% (22/23) and 65% (15/23) reported using saline nasal irrigation during the first and second week, respectively. Semi-structured interviews with 16 participants revealed that most were positive about trial participation and viewed saline nasal irrigation as acceptable, noting it as alternative to antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Saline nasal irrigation is deemed acceptable for adults with acute sinusitis and a trial of such intervention is feasible. A large trial is warranted to assess the effectiveness of this intervention for this common condition."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids added to high volume saline nasal irrigation have been introduced as a more effective method of delivering corticosteroids to the sinuses than nasal sprays. However, information regarding the effect of this intervention on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is still limited. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of long-term corticosteroid (6 months) nasal irrigation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) post endoscopic sinus surgery. METHODS: Seventeen patients with CRS were included. After undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery, the patients were prescribed budesonide nasal irrigations (250 ml via squeeze bottle) twice daily (1 mg/day) for six months. The serum morning cortisol levels of these patients were then evaluated at 3 and 6 months post-operatively. RESULTS: Median serum morning cortisol levels were 10.5 mcg% at pre-operative baseline; 10.3 mcg% at 3 months; and 11.2 mcg% at 6 months on post-operative follow-up. There were no significant changes in the serum morning cortisol levels (P value = 0.71 and 0.63 respectively). Three of 17 patients (17.65%) had mildly abnormal serum morning cortisol levels (4, 4.3 and 4.9 mcg%) at 3 months. However, these levels were within a normal range at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Serum morning cortisol levels were not significantly changed after usage of budesonide nasal irrigation for 6 months."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated that corticosteroid delivered by nasal irrigation is superior to nasal spray in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis patients who have undergone sinus surgery. However, the local cytotoxicity of both delivery methods has not been previously evaluated. In this study we aimed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of corticosteroid prepared nasal irrigation solution and commercially available corticosteroid nasal spray. METHODS: Primary human nasal epithelial air-liquid interface 3D cultures established from nasal brushes from patients with nasal diseases with polyps, and healthy nasal mucosa (n = 6 each) were used to assess the cytotoxicity of different drug concentrations. The following drugs were screened: budesonide rinse, mometasone rinse, mometasone spray, fluticasone spray, azelastine/fluticasone spray, xylometazoline drops and benzalkonium chloride. Nasal epithelial cell characterization at passage zero was evaluated with β- Tubulin and FOXJ1 immunostaining as well as fluorescence-activated cell sorting using epithelial cell marker (EpCAM-488). To assess the drug induced cytotoxicity, an Alamar Blue assay, transepithelial electrical resistance and optical microscopy were applied. RESULTS: Nasal irrigation using standard therapeutic concentrations of mometasone or budesonide demonstrated less cytotoxicity when compared to nasal spray of mometasone and fluticasone in stock concentration prescribed by the manufacturer. Nasal spray diluted by a factor of 10 demonstrated similar cytotoxicity to nasal irrigation using therapeutic concentration. This study reinforces the suspicion that it is not the drugs themselves but benzalkonium chloride that is the most involved in cytotoxicity. CONCLUSION: Corticosteroid irrigation is less cytotoxic than corticosteroid spray to nasal epithelial cells."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a prevalent inflammatory condition that substantially affects patients' quality of life. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is commonly performed in cases where medical therapy fails. Effective post-operative drug delivery is crucial for improving outcomes. This study uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to compare nebulisation and nasal irrigation (bottle wash) in post-operative sinonasal models and to evaluate how anatomical alterations affect drug deposition across various paranasal sinuses. METHODS: Eight post-FESS models were generated from the CT scans of a 29-year-old female CRS patient. These models included variations in maxillary ostium sizes, both with and without partial middle turbinectomy. Using 3D Slicer®, images were segmented, and Ansys SpaceClaim® prepared the final geometries. CFD simulations then examined drug delivery efficiency for both nebulisation and nasal irrigation. RESULTS: Nebulisation faces considerable challenges due to sinus complexity; however, surgical modifications improved nebuliser deposition in the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. In contrast, nasal irrigation showed higher efficiency in delivering drugs to the frontal sinuses. The residual liquid layer on sinus walls after irrigation significantly impacts comparative evaluations of these methods. CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasise the importance of adapting drug delivery strategies to specific surgical and anatomical factors. Tailored post-operative protocols may enhance outcomes in CRS, potentially improving patient comfort and compliance, and reducing recurrence rates. Further investigations are warranted to precisely quantify the liquid layer thickness remaining after irrigation, particularly as head movements can result in medication flowing back from sinuses into the nasal cavity.",

      "abstract": "Nasal irrigation, a nonpharmacological intervention for alleviating nasal symptoms, has yet to gain widespread acceptance among caregivers due to procedural ambiguities and the absence of a standardized protocol. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of normal saline nasal irrigation in managing allergic rhinitis among children aged 6 to 12 years. This prospective, randomized, single-blind trial enrolled children aged 6 to 12 with allergic rhinitis. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either standard care (oral antihistamine and intranasal corticosteroid) or standard care plus nasal irrigation with saline solution. Symptom severity, assessed using the Pediatric Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (PRQLQ) at baseline, 1, and 3 months, included rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sneezing, pruritus, ocular symptoms, and functional impairment. The intervention group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in several domains post-intervention. Specifically, a marked reduction in sneezing frequency and nasal cleansing requirements was observed. Moreover, this group reported significantly lower ocular symptoms, including irritation, itching, and watering, relative to the control group. Although overall PRQLQ scores did not differ significantly between groups, the intervention group exhibited lower scores at the 1- and 3-month follow-ups, indicative of enhanced quality of life. These findings suggest a potential beneficial effect of the intervention on participant well-being. The findings of this study indicate that nasal irrigation with 0.65% saline solution 4 times daily may serve as an effective adjunct treatment for children with allergic rhinitis. This regimen was associated with significant enhancements in both nasal symptom severity and quality of life.",

Chronic otorrhea (CO) is an important complication in children with tympanostomy tubes (TT), requiring additional treatment. OBJECTIVE: Determine potential factors of NI that put children with TT at risk of developing CO. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Single tertiary level of care pediatric hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients under the age of 18 with bilateral TT presenting between June and September 2023 were selected. INTERVENTION: All patients in this study used NI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome was the development of CO, defined as 10 or more consecutive days of ear drainage despite proper treatment. RESULTS: Twenty consecutive patients with CO were recruited and compared to 100 consecutive controls without CO. The mean age was similar, with 22.9 ± 18.4 months for the CO group and 25.2 ± 16.4 months for the control group (P = .59). An immediate discharge occurred more frequently in the CO group (80%) than in the control group (46%, P = .005; OR: 4.70; 95% CI: 1.5-13.5). A fast rate of administration of NI was more prevalent in the CO group (75%) compared to the control group (51%, P = .049; OR: 2.88; 95% CI: 1.0-7.6). TT insertion under local anesthesia occurred more frequently in the CO group (45%) than in the control group (22%, P = .03; OR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.1-7.4). No statistical difference was found between groups in the frequency and volume of NI. No patients with CO used a small volume of NI (≤5 mL). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: A fast rate of administration of NI was correlated with an increased risk of CO. Patients should be encouraged to apply gentle pressure as it could potentially prevent this complication.",

We aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of budesonide nasal irrigation (BNI) in managing CRS. METHODOLOGY: A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed following PRISMA guidelines. Data were extracted independently from the eligible studies. In double-arm and single-arm meta-analyses, continuous outcomes were pooled using mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were reviewed, comprising 1464 patients. BNI had better outcomes than saline nasal irrigation (SNI) regarding Sino-Nasal Outcome Test score (SNOT-22). Lund-Kennedy Endoscopy scores (LKES) changed from baseline. Regarding safety, there was no significant difference between BNI and SNI regarding Intraocular Pressure (IOP). Single-arm analysis showed a pooled mean serum cortisol level within the normal range after BNI. CONCLUSIONS: BNI demonstrated improved SNOT-22 and LKES scores, with normal post-treatment IOP and cortisol levels, indicating a beneficial impact on CRS while maintaining safety.",

      "abstract": "Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are defined as infectious diseases confined anatomically to the upper respiratory tract, with a duration of up to 28 days. Treatment for URTIs in pediatrics typically involves antipyretics and decongestants and, at times, antibiotics, despite most infections being viral. Nasal irrigation with saline solution is frequently used as an adjunct treatment for URTI symptoms. Currently, there is no consensus on whether nasal irrigation with saline offers significant benefits in reducing the severity of URTI symptoms. This systematic review aims to assess the scientific evidence supporting nasal irrigation with saline as a recommendation to alleviate symptom severity in pediatric URTI cases. We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Medline, and Scopus databases, covering the period from January 2010 to May 2024 in Portuguese, Spanish, and English. MeSH terms used were: (((pediatrics) OR (children) OR (infant) OR (adolescent) OR (child)) AND ((isotonic saline solution) OR (nasal douching) OR (nasal saline irrigation) OR (nasal lavage fluid)) AND ((respiratory disease) OR (upper respiratory tract infection))). Only randomized controlled trials were included, and we assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (ROBIS 2.0). The Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) was applied to determine the level of evidence and strength of recommendation. The initial search yielded 158 articles, of which only four met the criteria for inclusion in this systematic review. All studies evaluated whether saline nasal irrigation, with or without additional treatments, contributes to symptom improvement in pediatric URTIs. Notably, some studies reported symptom relief and even faster recovery times with its use. Based on our analysis, nasal irrigation with saline solution may reduce symptom severity in children with URTIs, with a level of evidence of 2 and a recommendation strength of B. Further research with more robust methodologies is needed to confirm these findings."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In a previous pilot randomised controlled trial conducted on UK adults, we found that hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling (HSNIG) reduced common cold symptoms, the need for over-the-counter medications, viral shedding, and the duration and transmission of the illness. It is unclear whether HSNIG improves outcomes of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hypertonic saline can be prepared and HSNIG performed at home, making it a safe and scalable intervention, particularly well-suited for low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic randomised controlled trial in Pakistan on adults with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, initially within 48 hours of symptom onset, later extended to within five days due to recruitment challenges. Participants were randomised to one of two groups: the intervention group received instructions on preparing a 2.6% hypertonic saline solution for HSNIG, while the control group was instructed on performing ablution for Muslim prayers (wudu), which involves nasal washing and gargling with tap water. Our primary outcome was the time to symptom resolution, measured by two consecutive days of scoring zero on relevant questions from the validated, self-reported, adapted short form of the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-24). Secondary outcomes included the severity of all symptoms, the severity and time to resolution of individual symptoms, health care contacts (GP/physician, emergency contacts), hospital attendance (and length of stay if admitted), over-the-counter (OTC) medication (frequency and cost), and transmission to household contacts. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of improvement and Cox regression to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for the time to improvement with accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: We randomised 576 people: 279 to the HSNIG group and 297 to the control group. Among those, 10 out of 279 (3.6%) in the HSNIG had symptom resolution, compared with 11 out of 297 (3.7%) in the control group (aOR = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.46- 3.22). The time-to-event analysis also showed no significant benefit (aHR = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.51-2.97). Excluding the 127 participants with no data on the primary outcome (who did not complete the study), 10 out of 222 (4.5%) in the HSNIG group had symptom resolution, compared to 11 out of 227 (4.8%) in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: HSNIG was not effective for individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who began the intervention within five days of symptoms onset and therefore cannot be recommended for use. Further investigation is needed for interventions started within 48 hours of illness onset. REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05104372).",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The World Health Organization declared an end to the global emergency status of COVID-19 in May of 2023. However, the impact of COVID-19 is far from over. Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 continue to experience physiological, psychological, or cognitive symptoms, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, and loss of smell or taste, known as long COVID. This review aims to describe the clinical characteristics of the upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) caused by SARS-CoV-2, and provide evidence for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection by using nasal irrigation. COVID-19 and nasal irrigation: Nasal irrigation presents a promising adjunct to standard COVID-19 prevention and treatment protocols. This practice is theorized to diminish viral presence in the upper respiratory tract, a region identified as a primary site for SARS-CoV-2 replication and shedding. By facilitating the removal of viral particles and enhancing mucociliary clearance, nasal irrigation could potentially lessen the severity of URTI symptoms and slow transmission rates. The review consolidates current evidence of the efficacy and safety of this approach across various populations, underscoring its practicality in both preventive and therapeutic contexts. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that saline nasal irrigation is an effective, safe and convenient strategy to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and alleviate the symptoms of URTI across various age groups.",

      "abstract": "In Brazil, nasal irrigation is a common procedure for children hospitalized with respiratory conditions. However, it often causes stress for both the child and their family. Nurses need to rethink their approach to care, and the use of therapeutic play can be an ally in transforming the stressful context. To understand the family perceptions of nasal irrigation in hospitalized children after an educational intervention mediated by instructional therapeutic play (ITP). This descriptive, exploratory, and qualitative study was conducted from the perspective of Herbert Blumer's Symbolic Interactionism in a hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. The study included family members of hospitalized children aged 3-6 years who participated in an ITP intervention and remained for 6 hours afterward. Participants self-reported literacy with preserved cognition and verbal communication. This study was conducted between March 2023 and January 2024 using semi-structured interviews with 38 family members. Data were analyzed using Bardin's thematic content and lexical analysis with IRAMUTEQ® software. The interaction of families with ITP for nasal irrigation in children led to a redefinition of the procedure from distressing to enjoyable. ITP was evaluated as an essential and stimulating method that familiarized the child with the procedure, facilitating the understanding process for both the child and the family. ITP is a caregiving technology that nurses can use to assist with nasal irrigation, re-signifying the experiences of children and their families during the procedure.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is often a difficult and long-term behavior, so it is necessary to seek a local treatment method that can be used for a long time, and is safe and effective. Nasal saline irrigation after functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is currently recognized as a local treatment method, but it has no anti-inflammatory, anti-damage, and healing-promoting functions. To investigate the efficacy and safety of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) for nasal irrigation after CRS surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 61 patients after CRS completed the study. Subjects were randomly assigned to rinse the nasal cavity with HRS or normal saline (NS) after CRS. Participants were followed up once a week for 12 times, and were evaluated with visual analogue score (VAS), 22-item Sinonasal Outcomes Test (SNOT-22), and Lund-Kennedy endoscopy scores (LKES). The primary outcome was the VAS score of patients. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of follow-up, the VAS scores of both groups decreased, and the HRS group (0.52±0.85) was lower than the NS group (1.47±1.55), P=0.005. The total number of cases with complete control (clinical cure) in the short-term efficacy evaluation was more in the HRS group (20/31) than in the NS group (11/30), P=0.03<0.05. No obvious adverse reactions occurred in the two groups during the follow-up. CONCLUSION: This study found that HRS was more effective than NS alone in nasal irrigation after CRS surgery, and could shorten the time of nasal mucosal healing and epithelialization, with a higher rate of recent complete control."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: We aimed to assess the presence of microplastics in nasal irrigation methods commonly used in the treatment of sinusitis and rhinitis, and to evaluate human exposure. METHODS: A total of 150 samples were included in the study, consisting of nasal wash bottles containing nasal irrigation solution, seawater spray, syringes for nasal irrigation with isotonic solution. The amount of microplastics per millilitre in the samples and patient exposure during single use were assessed separately for each method and product. All samples were filtered using a stainless steel vacuum filter on filter paper with a pore size of 1.2 μm, washed at least three times with distilled water and incubated at 45 °C for 24 h to prevent mould growth. Identification and counting of microplastics was performed using a Leica Flexacam C1 camera connected to an M80 stereomicroscope. The presence of microplastics was confirmed by the hot needle method and Nile red staining. RESULTS: An average of 6.49 ± 13.08 microplastics/product was detected in all filtered samples. The lowest microplastic count was 0 microplastics/product in syringes and the highest was 92 microplastics/product in nasal wash bottles. Significant differences in the amount of microplastics individuals were exposed to during a single use were found between nasal wash bottles and seawater brands, while no significant differences were found between syringe brands. When nasal wash kits, seawater sprays and isotonic nasal rinses were evaluated separately, significant differences were found in the number of microplastics, the microplastics/ml ratio and the number of microplastics exposed during a single use. The highest microplastic exposure was found in nasal irrigation bottles. CONCLUSION: The exposure of individuals to microplastics increases with medical support treatments, regardless of intranasal or intravenous administration. Due to the inflammation, oxidative stress and proliferation caused by microplastics, new regulations and inspections of production conditions should be implemented worldwide to reduce exposure.",

This systematic review investigated the efficacy of nasal irrigation with saline, povidone iodine (PVP-I), and intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) at reducing SARS-CoV-2 NVL and transmissibility. DATA SOURCES: Databases including Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review was completed with pre-defined search criteria using keywords related to nasal irrigation and COVID-19 from 1946 through January 2024. This review followed PRISMA reporting guidelines and was registered on PROSPERO. Only in-vivo studies testing nasal irrigation with either saline, PVP-I, or INCS for reducing NVL were included. RESULTS: Nine out of ten studies on saline-based solutions reported positive effects in reducing NVL, with benefits noted in earlier time to negative nasopharyngeal PCR and a greater decline in NVL during early study time points, compared with controls. Isotonic and hypertonic saline mediums were found to be effective with three studies demonstrating enhanced efficacy with additives. Four out of seven studies on PVP-I showed a positive effect on reducing NVL, but results were heterogenous. Four studies demonstrated reduction of transmission with saline or PVP-I. No studies were found on INCS. CONCLUSION: Saline nasal irrigation showed the best efficacy in reducing SARS-CoV-2 NVL. Additives to saline may have a clinical benefit, but further studies are needed to elucidate their isolated impacts on NVL. Data on PVP-I is inconclusive and further studies are warranted to determine the ideal concentration for irrigation. Laryngoscope, 135:517-528, 2025.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is a mainstay surgical intervention for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). Nasal irrigation, particularly with normal saline, is a widely recommended postoperative care modality. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy of various nasal irrigation solutions in postoperative FESS patients. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in multiple databases for randomized controlled trials investigating normal saline and various substances for nasal irrigation post-FESS. The systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines, and the meta-analysis used R software for data synthesis. Outcome measures included SNOT-22 and LKES scores. The Cochrane tool was employed to evaluate the potential for bias. RESULTS: Results from 14 studies, focusing on six each for SNOT-22 and LKES, revealed a significant reduction in symptoms and endoscopic scores with various solutions compared to normal saline. The meta-analysis using the random-effects model indicated a negative standardized mean difference (SMD) of - 0.69(95% CI [- 1.64; 0.27], p = 0.157) for symptoms and endoscopic scores (SMD = - 0.48, 95% CI [- 1.32; 0.36], z = - 1.12, p = 0.264). Subgroup analyses highlighted budesonide's efficacy over normal saline, but substantial heterogeneity and potential publication bias were noted. CONCLUSION: Nasal irrigation with various solutions postoperative FESS patients demonstrated significant improvements in patient-reported symptoms and endoscopic scores compared to normal saline. Budesonide appeared particularly effective. However, high heterogeneity and potential publication bias warrant cautious interpretation. Standardized outcome measures and further research are needed to strengthen the evidence.",

METHODS: A total of 66 patients with CRS were randomly divided into two groups, for which the experimental group received evidence-based nasal irrigation nursing, and the control group received conventional nursing. Differences in Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-20 (SNOT-20), visual analogue scale (VAS), Lund-Mackay CT, Endoscopic Lund Kennedy Score (LKES) and overall efficacy were assessed between the two groups. RESULTS: 2, 4 and 12 weeks after the intervention, the scores of SNOT-20, VAS, Lund-Mackay CT and LKES in the two groups were significantly lower than those before the surgery (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the scores were significantly lower in the experimental group (P < 0.05). 12 weeks after the intervention, the overall effective rate of treatment in the experimental group was 90.62%, while the control group was 16.43%, but the difference was not statistically significant in treatment effect (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of nasal irrigation evidence-based nursing program for patients with CRS after endoscopic sinus surgery can promote postoperative nasal mucosal recovery, improve treatment efficiency, and help improve patient comfort, quality of life and other subjective feelings.

We searched the PubMed database for 342 articles in the last decade, using the keywords \"saline nasal irrigation\" and \"chronic rhinosinusitis.\" We summarize the studies on the mechanism of action, rinsing solution, rinsing apparatus, and rinsing method of NI for CRS. NI plays an important role in the treatment of CRS, and it is a beneficial low-risk treatment. Isotonic saline is the most accepted flushing solution, and large-volume low-pressure flushing bottles are the flushing devices with the best flushing effect and are generally tolerated by patients. Phage, colloidal silver, and hydrogen can be further studied as components of rinses. NI plays an important role in the treatment of CRS, and it is a beneficial low-risk treatment. Further high-quality and expanded sample size studies on other flushing solutions, flushing head position, flushing frequency, and treatment courses are still needed, and lessons learned in practice."

This study aimed to investigate and explore the efficacy of physiological seawater nasal irrigation (PSNI) on children with mild and asymptomatic infection with Omicron. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in Shanghai, China, and 403 children with mild and asymptomatic infection with Omicron were included. These children were allocated into the PSNI group and the control group. The primary outcome was the duration of viral shedding (DVS), and the secondary outcome was the change in clinical symptoms. RESULTS: The median age of all participants was 5.59 (6.26) years old. The DVS was significantly shorter in the PSNI group [2.40 (1.13)] than in the control group [3.09 (2.14)] (P = 0.014). The multivariable Cox regression model also showed that patients in the PSNI group had an increased probability of shorter DVS compared with patients in the control group [hazard ratio (HR), 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-1.55; P = 0.017]. Subgroup analysis suggested that the DVS of patients without full vaccination was significantly reduced in the PSNI group. The proportions of runny nose and stuffy nose were apparently reduced in the first three days in the PSNI group or the control group, but there was no evidence showing that PSNI contributes to the benefit compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: PSNI can reduce the DVS of patients with mild and asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 variant.",

Methods: This quasi-experimental study included children diagnosed with asymptomatic, mild, and moderate Omicron variant infection during the isolation observation period in the Shandong Public Health Clinical Center between April 1, 2022 and May 1, 2022. The children were divided into a routine group (received Lianhua Qingwen (LhQw) Granules), isotonic saline group (received LhQw Granules combined with isotonic saline nasal irrigation), and hypertonic saline group (received LhQw Granules combined with 3% hypertonic saline nasal irrigation), respectively. The primary outcomes were the time of symptom disappearance and nucleic acid conversion time. The secondary outcomes were peripheral white blood cell count (WBC), lymphocyte count (LYM), neutrophil count (NEU), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Results: A total of 60 children (7.26 ± 3.15 years old) were included (20 per group). The average time of nucleic acid conversion in the 2 saline nasal irrigation groups was significantly reduced compared with the routine group (all P < 0.001), while the fever time and cough duration among the 3 groups were comparable (all P > 0.05). LYM count in the 2 saline nasal irrigation groups was significantly increased after treatment compared to before treatment and was significantly higher than in the routine group (all P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in LYM count between the isotonic and hypertonic saline groups (P = 0.76). Additionally, all children in the saline group well tolerated the treatment, and no adverse events occurred in the isotonic saline group. Conclusions: Timely use of saline nasal irrigation may promote nucleic acid conversion in children with Omicron virus infection.",

The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of nasal irrigation and oral rinse with sodium bicarbonate solution on virus clearance among COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: COVID-19 patients were recruited and randomly divided into two group, i.e., the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group received regular care plus nasal irrigation and oral rinse with 5% sodium bicarbonate solution, while the control group only received regular care. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples were collected daily for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. The negative conversion time and hospitalization time of the patients were recorded, and the results were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 55 COVID-19 patients with mild or moderate symptoms were included in our study. There was no significant difference in gender, age and health status between the two groups. The average negative conversion time was 1.63 days after treatment with sodium bicarbonate, and the average hospitalization time of the control group and the experimental group were 12.53 and 7.7 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Nasal irrigation and oral rinse with 5% sodium bicarbonate solution is effective in virus clearance for COVID-19 patients.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of nasal irrigation on the duration of symptoms and nucleic acid conversion in adults infected with the Omicron variant of COVID-19. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study enrolled patients diagnosed with asymptomatic, mild, or moderate Omicron infection at the Shandong Public Health Clinical Center between April 1, 2022 and May 1, 2022. Patients were divided into two groups to receive Lianhua Qingwen granules and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescriptions (conventional group) and 3% hypertonic saline nasal irrigation based on conventional treatment (nasal irrigation groups), respectively. Primary outcomes were symptom disappearance time and nucleic acid negative conversion time. Secondary outcomes were peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte (LYM) count, neutrophil (NEU) count, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and chest CT examination findings. RESULTS: Eighty patients were included (40 patients/group). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for comorbidities, smoking history, LYM count, and Ct values of N gene, the patients in the nasal irrigation group were more likely to get lower nucleic acid negative conversion time (β = -11.052, 95% CI: -8.277-13.827, P < 0.001) compared with the conventional group. The symptom disappearance time showed no significant improvement (P > 0.05). Subgroup analysis for treatment-naïve patients in the nasal irrigation group showed similar nucleic acid negative conversion time improvement (P = 0.038). CONCLUSION: Early nasal irrigation shortens the nucleic acid negative conversion time in adults infected with the Omicron variant but without improvements in symptom disappearance time.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using a hypertonic seawater nasal irrigation solution comprising natural ingredients (HSS-Plus) with the aim of reducing viral load and ameliorating nasal symptoms in cases of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This single-center, prospective, single-arm, low-intervention study evaluated daily use of HSS-Plus in patients admitted to the Sotiria Hospital, Athens, Greece for a period of up to 10 days or until hospital discharge. Viral load measurements in nasopharyngeal swabs were performed on days 0 (baseline), 3 and 6, and on the final day of participation (day 10 ± 2; hospital discharge). In addition, study participants were asked to rate the severity of nasal and other symptoms using Visual Analog Scales (VAS) at the same time points. At the final day, the patients also assessed the perceived use benefit of HSS-Plus. RESULTS: 47 patients were enrolled in the study; 93.6% had a decrease in viral load of at least > 0.5 log10 on day 10 (p<0.001). Compared to values before nasal irrigation, viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs increased immediately after nasal lavage on days 3 (p=0.037) and 6 (p=0.010), indicating efficient removal of viral particles from the nasal cavity. Mean VAS symptoms' total score was reduced from 27.57 ± 15.63 at baseline to 6.73 ± 6.59 after 10 days (p<0.001). Similar reductions were also evident for individual symptoms at all time points (p<0.005). No adverse events were reported in the study. CONCLUSIONS: HSS-Plus nasal irrigation is an effective and safe method for reducing viral load and providing symptom relief in patients with COVID-19.",

      "abstract": "Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a chronic inflammatory process of nasal mucosa and paranasal sinuses, lasting more than 12 weeks, without complete resolution of symptoms. CRS is treated medically, followed by Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) if necessary, and supplemented by post-operative topical treatment with highly variable clinical outcomes. However, till date there is no consensus on the composition and duration of maximal medical treatment. Despite proven role of topical steroids, the mode of delivery, dose and duration of topical intranasal corticosteroids still remains debatable. Studies found that high volume sinonasal irrigation (> 50 ml) using budesonide is most efficient method but still there is not sufficient data to prove this and results are variable with multiple modifiable factors therefore, this study has been conducted. (1) To determine the difference in mean decrease in Lund-Kennedy endoscopic scores and SNOT-22 scores among post ESS patients with high volume budesonide nasal irrigation nasal cavity and control nasal cavity of chronic rhinosinusitis patients. (2) To determine safety by measuring serum cortisol levels and intra ocular pressure. This is hospital based interventional, randomised, double blind, control trial study. A total of 66 patients of CRS with previous failed medical therapy were included. Same patients nasal cavities were divided into control and case nasal cavities, to avoid demographic bias. All subjects had a baseline SNOT-22 scores (Sino Nasal Outcome Test scores), Lund Kennedy endoscopy score, NCCT PNS score. All patients were undergone ESS procedure. After nasal pack removal, nasal cavities were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive normal saline irrigation (control group) or 1 mg of budesonide irrigation (case group) for transnasal irrigation twice daily for 12 weeks. A total of 66 patients with 132 nasal cavities were included in the study. Out of which 16 were female and 50 were male with mean age 33 year and mean duration of symptoms was 38.19 months. Mean duration of follow up was for 3 months. Mean decrement in SNOT-22 score in control nasal cavity from 52.54(16.309) to 30.06 (18.16) and in endoscopic score from 6.53 (1.33) to 3.93 (1.6) which is statically significant (p value < 0.05) in both scores. Mean decrement in SNOT-22 score in case nasal cavity from 53.73 (15.75) to 21.15 (13.52) and in endoscopic score from 6.74 (1.8) to 2.77 (1.4) which is statically significant (p value < 0.05) in both scores. Decrement in SNOT-22 scores and endoscopy scores in case nasal cavity in comparision to control nasal cavity were compared by student 't' test and found to be statically significant (p value equals to 0.0001). In subjective outcomes 57.57% shows total improvement in control nasal cavities while 72.73% case nasal cavities shows total improvement. Our study shows high volume budesonide irrigation is safe and superior over normal saline irrigation and results were statistically comparable. Still further studies with larger sample size and longer duration of irrigation needed.Based on available evidence, high volume budesonide irrigation is statically safe and superior over normal saline irrigation."

Nasal irrigation is a classic and powerful adjunctive method for the management of chronic rhinosinusitis after FESS [5]. This study aimed to compare the effects of hypertonic saline and isotonic saline nasal irrigation following endoscopic sinus surgery. The study was conducted in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at Mahatma Gandhi Medical College and Hospital, Jaipur, India, on 156 patients, who had chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyposis, and were resistant to conservative management. All patients underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Patients were advised to perform nasal douching post-surgery, and were randomly divided into two groups based on the douching solution they used. Group 1 was given hypertonic saline (3%) while Group 2 was given isotonic saline (0.9%). Patients were examined at weeks 1, 3 and 6 post-operatively. Outcomes of irrigation using both solutions were assessed by- 20-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT20) scores [13], Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores [1, 2], mucociliary clearance (MCC) assessment [14] and endoscopic examination. The group receiving hypertonic saline showed significant improvement in 20-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test scores, Visual analogue scale scores and improvement of sino-nasal mucosa from polypoidal to cobblestone, in the follow up period. However improvement in mucociliary clearance and resolution of postoperative crustings was consistent in both groups. Hypertonic saline nasal irrigation post FESS brings greater benefits on symptom improvement and normalization of the sino-nasal mucosa over isotonic saline."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To date, treating nasal polyps (NPs) is still a medical challenge. However, we have developed an innovative therapy using licorice extract (LE: Glycyrrhiza glabra) to treat rhinitis and sinusitis via nasal irrigation and have discovered that it significantly affects treatment of NPs. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: This study investigated the mechanism of LE on NPs. STUDY DESIGN: NPs were collected from three patients using tissue biopsies before and 2 weeks after nasal irrigation with licorice for histopathological analysis. Additionally, NPs from two patients were collected, and nasal polyp-derived fibroblasts (NPDF) were isolated and cultured. METHODS: The TGF-β1-stimulated NPDF model was used to examine the effect of LE on fibroblast differentiation (biomarker: α-SMA), the consequent production of extracellular matrix (ECM; biomarkers: fibronectin, FBN), and the functional signaling pathway. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed that the number of eosinophils and the expression of α-SMA and interstitial collagen of polyps after licorice treatment significantly decreased. Additionally, RT-PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence (IF) showed that α-SMA and FBN expressions were significantly increased in the NPDF, which was stimulated by TGF-β1, and LE dose-dependently could effectively reduce this effect. Furthermore, western blotting showed that LE could attenuate α-SMA and FBN expressions by preventing the signaling pathway of MAPK/ERK-1/2, which IHC and IF further confirmed. In addition, LE effectively suppressed the cell migration of NPDF, which is related to polyp expansion. CONCLUSION: LE is clinically used to treat sinusitis with NPs through nasal irrigation, which significantly reduces the size of NPs. This effect could attenuate fibroblast differentiation, ECM production and cell migration, and one of the functional mechanisms may be through inhibition of the MAPK/ERK-1/2 signaling pathway.

PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred thirty-seven COVID-19 participants with a new-onset smell loss were recruited into the study. Two hundred twenty-two participants met the inclusion criteria and were randomised into three groups: corticosteroid irrigation, saline irrigation and no treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the mean difference in the smell sensation score among the groups after treatment at 1, 2 and 6 weeks. The secondary outcomes measurements included (1) a self-rating quality of life (QOL)-related smell dysfunction score, (2) the change over time in smell sensation score and self-rating QOL-related smell dysfunction score and (3) the median time to complete recovery of smell loss. RESULTS: The mean differences in smell sensation scores among the three groups were not statistically significant at any follow-up period. The mean score of self-rating QOL-related smell dysfunction in the corticosteroid group was significantly better than the other groups at 1 week. The change of outcome scores showed significant improvement over time, regardless of the treatments. The median time to complete smell recovery was similar: 3 weeks. CONCLUSION: This study emphasised that corticosteroid nasal irrigation is not superior to saline or no nasal irrigation in restoring the sense of smell in COVID-19-associated olfactory loss.",

S. mitis has been reported in several cases of streptococcal infective endocarditis (IE). Streptococcal IE is most associated with dental procedures and diseases of the mouth. There are fewer reports of diseases of the nasopharynx leading to endocarditis secondary to nasal irrigation systems, and that is why we present a unique case of mitral valve IE secondary to nasal irrigation. We report a case of a 49-year-old African American woman with a history of chronic allergic rhinitis who presented with chest pain and subjective fevers. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) failed to show valvular vegetation, but high clinical suspicion led to transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) imaging that demonstrated a mobile echo density with a size of 5mm by 3mm attached to the atrial side of the anterior mitral valve leaflet with thickening of the anterior mitral leaflet tip as well as moderate mitral valve regurgitation. Findings on TTE were consistent with IE. The patient still has organized/nodular vegetation after three months of appropriate antibiotic therapy. We highlight how poor nasal hygiene is low on the differential for a cause of valvular endocarditis. This case will help clinicians in determining appropriate therapy for chronic allergic rhinitis. This will also help clinicians to inform patients to stop using nasal irrigation systems if epistaxis is present."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Nasal saline irrigation is highly recommended in patients following functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) to aid the postoperative recovery. Post-FESS patients have significantly altered anatomy leading to markedly different flow dynamics from those found in pre-op or non-diseased airways, resulting in unknown flow dynamics. METHODS: This work investigated how the liquid stream disperses through altered nasal cavities following surgery using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A realistic squeeze profile was determined from physical experiments with a 27-year-old male using a squeeze bottle with load sensors. The administration technique involved a head tilt of 45-degrees forward to represent a head position over a sink. After the irrigation event that lasted 4.5 s, the simulation continued for an additional 1.5 s, with the head orientation returning to an upright position. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that a large maxillary sinus ostium on the right side allows saline penetration into this sinus. The increased volume of saline entering the maxillary sinus limits the saline volume available to the rest of the sinonasal cavity and reduces the surface coverage of the other paranasal sinuses. The average wall shear stress was higher on the right side than on the other side for two patients. The results also revealed that head position alters the sinuses' saline residual, especially the frontal sinuses. CONCLUSION: While greater access to sinuses is achieved through FESS surgery, patients without a nasal septum limits posterior sinus penetration due to the liquid crossing over to the contralateral cavity and exiting the nasal cavity early.",

The possible advantages of SNI include the following benefits due to the well-known antiviral impact of sodium chloride (NaCl) and the mechanical cleansing effect arising from the irrigation method. First, there will most likely be a decrease in COVID-19 infection rates; second, illness severity will be lowered; and third, community transmission will be mitigated. Despite the need for more concentrated research into these aspects, public health organizations should emphasize alternate infection mitigation measures such as SNI in light of the ongoing COVID-19 problem, low global vaccine supply, and the rapid introduction of SARS-CoV-2 variants.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Continuous comprehensive treatment is still needed after endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) to promote the recovery of sinus mucosal morphology and function. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) nasal irrigation is a promising external treatment of TCM, but at present, the application of TCM nasal irrigation after ESS for CRS has not been recommended by the guidelines. Therefore, this article aims to develop a systematic overview and meta-analysis protocol to assess the effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbal nasal rinse for CRS recovery after ESS. METHODS: Seven databases shall be retrieved from their inception until December 2021. Eligible randomized controlled trials will be covered in the study. The outcome indicators of the survey will consist of efficacy, visual analogue scale score, Lund-Kennedy score for nasal endoscopy, Lund-Mackay score for sinus computed tomography and other secondary outcome indicators. The selection of literature, extraction of data, and methodological quality evaluation of literature shall be conducted by two researchers separately. If there is any dispute, it can be discussed and solved by a third researcher. Review Manager 5.3 software will be applied to data analysis. RESULTS: The article will make a detailed research programme to explore the efficacy and safety of TCM nasal irrigation on CRS recovery after ESS. CONCLUSION: This protocol is suitable for evaluating the effectiveness and safety of TCM nasal rinse for CRS recovery after ESS, and can provide corresponding evidence-based medical evidence.

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Recent studies suggest that theophylline added to saline nasal irrigation (SNI) can be an effective treatment for postviral olfactory dysfunction (OD), a growing public health concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of theophylline added to SNI compared with placebo for COVID-19-related OD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This triple-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 2 randomized clinical trial was conducted virtually between March 15 and August 31, 2021. Adults residing in Missouri or Illinois were recruited during this time period if they had OD persisting for 3 to 12 months following suspected COVID-19 infection. Data analysis was conducted from October to December 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Saline sinus rinse kits and bottles of identical-appearing capsules with either 400 mg of theophylline (treatment) or 500 mg of lactose powder (control) were mailed to consenting study participants. Participants were instructed to dissolve the capsule contents into the saline rinse and use the solution to irrigate their nasal cavities in the morning and at night for 6 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the difference in the rate of responders between the treatment and the control arms, defined as a response of at least slightly better improvement in the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale posttreatment. Secondary outcome measures included changes in the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), the Questionnaire for Olfactory Disorders, the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey on general health, and COVID-19-related questions. RESULTS: A total of 51 participants were enrolled in the study; the mean (SD) age was 46.0 (13.1) years, and 36 (71%) participants were women. Participants were randomized to SNI with theophylline (n = 26) or to SNI with placebo (n = 25). Forty-five participants completed the study. At the end of treatment, 13 (59%) participants in the theophylline arm reported at least slight improvement in the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (responders) compared with 10 (43%) in the placebo arm (absolute difference, 15.6%; 95% CI, -13.2% to 44.5%). The median difference for the UPSIT change between baseline and 6 weeks was 3.0 (95% CI, -1.0 to 7.0) for participants in the theophylline arm and 0.0 (95% CI, -2.0 to 6.0) for participants in the placebo arm. Mixed-model analysis revealed that the change in UPSIT scores through study assessments was not statistically significantly different between the 2 study arms. Eleven (50%) participants in the theophylline arm and 6 (26%) in the placebo arm had a change of 4 or more points in UPSIT scores from baseline to 6 weeks. The difference in the rate of responders as measured by the UPSIT was 24% (95% CI, -4% to 52%) in favor of theophylline. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial suggests that the clinical benefit of theophylline nasal irrigations on olfaction in participants with COVID-19-related OD is inconclusive, though suggested by subjective assessments. Larger studies are warranted to investigate the efficacy of this treatment more fully. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04789499.",

DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomised clinical study was conducted at the Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery Department, Ramathibodi Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mahidol University. PARTICIPANTS: Forty patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for CRS. Thirty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned to receive nasal irrigation or nasal spray mixed with fluorescein sodium preoperatively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the mean difference in the staining score of fluorescein in all sinuses between the two groups. RESULTS: The total fluorescein staining score for all sinuses in the nasal irrigation group was significantly higher than the score from the nasal spray group, with a mean difference score of 2.90, 95% confidence interval: 1.22-4.58, p = .001. The most significantly affected sinuses were the maxillary and the anterior ethmoid sinuses, while the frontal and sphenoid sinuses had only minimal staining from both techniques. CONCLUSION: Nasal irrigation is a potential route to deliver drugs into the sinus in unoperated CRS patients. However, it is not considered a superior method to nasal spray in the most challenging anatomical areas, that is, the frontal and sphenoid sinuses.",

      "abstract": "Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in asthmatic patients has a high recurrence rate even after surgery. For this reason, oral steroids are frequently used, but their long-term use may cause side effects. The purpose of this study is to investigate the long-term effects of budesonide nasal irrigation (BNI) in CRSwNP and asthma. An analysis of 33 patients with CRSwNP and well-controlled asthma, who performed BNI for more than 12 months, was performed. We compared oral steroid and antibiotic dosages as well as nasal endoscopy scores before, and every six months after, BNI. The six-month dosages of oral steroids and antibiotics prescribed were significantly decreased at all time points after BNI compared to before BNI. When the dosages were compared at the time point immediately preceding six months, oral steroid intake decreased significantly until 12 months, and antibiotic intake decreased until 6 months. Furthermore, the endoscopic score decreased significantly until 12 months. The nasal symptom questionnaire score also significantly improved after BNI. Therefore, BNI is considered an effective treatment method that can improve subjective symptoms and objective intranasal findings while reducing oral steroid and antibiotic doses after long-term use in patients with CRSwNP accompanied by asthma."

STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, randomized, single-blinded study. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-five children diagnosed with CRS were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomized to twice-daily hypertonic irrigations with saline or saline/xylitol for 6 weeks. The treatment outcomes were measured using: Sinonasal Quality of Life Survey (SN-5) completed at baseline and after 6 weeks of irrigation. RESULTS: There were statistically significant improvements in the hypertonic nasal saline group's (reduction in SN-5 domain scores) four domains and an increase in the overall QoL score within each group after 6 weeks of treatment compared to baseline; however, there were no differences in the activity limitation (p = 0.1803). The xylitol solution groups had no differences between the two groups in the SN-5 scores in any of the domains or the overall score at baseline, and post irrigation treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Due to low tolerance, compliance, and the side effects, xylitol irrigation is not recommended as a first-line treatment for pediatric CRS. The use of a large volume of low pressure, twice-daily intranasal hypertonic irrigation for 6 weeks is safe and effective in the treatment of pediatric CRS; therefore, it can be used as a baseline treatment for pediatric CRS before considering surgical interventions.",

It will also study its impacts on the computed tomography (CT) score of the nasal sinus and negative reactions in patients. For this purpose, ninety (90) patients with chronic sinusitis were admitted to the hospital (June 2019 to June 2020). They were selected as the research subjects and divided into experimental and control groups randomly with 45 cases in each group. Control group patients were treated with nasal irrigation with normal saline. While, Biyuan Tongqiao granules combined with nasal irrigation with normal saline was treated by the experimental group. The CT scores of nasal sinus, clinical effect, the incidence of adverse reactions, recurrence rate, duration of nasal mucosal epithelialization, and nasal ciliary transmission speed of both the groups were compared. The patients' pain was assessed by the visual analogue scale (VAS), and the symptoms of sinusitis were scored by the SNOT-20 scale. The experimental group showed significantly lower sinus CT scores and better clinical effects. Adverse reactions were not observed in both the groups' probability (P > 0.05). The experimental group presented a significantly lower recurrence rate, shorter duration of nasal mucosal epithelialization, faster nasal ciliary transmission, and sharply lowers VAS scores and SNOT-20 scores than in the control group (P < 0.05). This proves Biyuan Tongqiao granules and nasal irrigation with normal saline can effectually boost the clinical efficacy and lessen the computed tomography score of nasal sinus in chronic sinusitis patients. It has a worthy clinical application and promotion.",

METHODS: This was a randomised controlled study involving 99 patients diagnosed with AR, half of whom were treated with saline nasal irrigation and the other half with budesonide nasal irrigation. Parameters measured include the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) questionnaire, endoscopic nasal examination findings and blood eosinophil count. RESULTS: Patients treated with budesonide nasal irrigation had significant improvement in total SNOT-22 score (P < 0.001) and improvement in the endoscopic nasal examination findings, such as nasal mucosa oedema and secretions (P < 0.001). However, there was no significant improvement of blood eosinophil count in patients treated with either budesonide or saline nasal irrigation.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nasal irrigation is among the most widely used treatment modalities for sinonasal diseases. The extent of irrigation is well studied in operated sinuses but not for non-operated sinuses. Moreover, the preferred head positioning during irrigation is not known. Herein, we studied the extent of nasal irrigation in cadaveric heads with non-operated sinuses. METHODS: Nine cadaveric heads were used. Normal saline solution mixed with radiological contrast material was used to irrigate the nasal cavities with the heads in 2 different positions: standing-leaning-forward (SLF) and Head-down forward (HDF). After each irrigation, computed tomography images of the head were acquired. The extent of irrigation was assessed for each subunit of the sinonasal cavity. RESULTS: Irrigation was performed twice on a total of 18 sides, each time in 1 position. Nine subunits were evaluated: inferior, middle, and superior meati; the olfactory cleft; and the frontal, maxillary, anterior, and posterior ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses. The extent of irrigation was significantly better in the HDF position for the olfactory cleft (100% vs 33%), P-value=.001, frontal sinus (33% vs 11%), P-value=.002, maxillary sinus (78% vs 17%), P-value=.001, and anterior ethmoid sinus (89% vs 17%), P-value=.001. There was no significant difference in the extent of irrigation between the 2 positions for the other evaluated subunits. The overall extent of irrigation was 70.37% of the subunits in HDF position and 45.06% of the subunits for SLF position, P-value= .001. CONCLUSIONS: Nasal irrigation reached the cavities of non-operated paranasal sinuses. However, while the extent of irrigation was limited in the SLF, it was well achieved in the HDF position. Studies on the clinical efficacy of irrigation in this position are recommended.",

Nasal irrigation has been recommended as the first-line treatment for CRS in various guidelines, and its clinical effectiveness has been demonstrated through a number of studies with robust evidence. However, no guidelines have presented a consistent nasal irrigation method. Several databases, including OVID Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and KoreaMed, were searched to identify all relevant papers using a predefined search strategy. When insufficient evidence was found, the GDG sought expert opinions and attempted to fill the evidence gap. Evidence-based recommendations for practice were ranked according to the American College of Physicians grading system. The committee developed 11 evidence-based recommendations. This guideline focuses on the evidence-based quality improvement opportunities deemed the most important by the GDG. Moreover, the guideline addresses whether nasal lavage helps treat CRS, what type of rinsing solution should be used, and the effectiveness of using additional medications to increase the therapeutic effect."

We also examined the effects of nasal irrigation after this procedure was performed. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was performed. Sixty patients of a tertiary hospital were enrolled in this study. The subjects were randomly divided into a control group and an intervention group. The subjects of the control group were given routine guidance, and 20 mL of normal saline was atomized through inhalation. The gauze was removed 7 days after surgery. The patients of the intervention group were given 50 mL of a 2% saline solution at 37°C to 38°C for bilateral nasal irrigation for 1 week. After that, patients were given 50 mL of a 0.9% normal saline solution at 37°C to 38°C for bilateral nasal irrigations. The complications of the two groups were collected at baseline, 1 week after intervention, 1 month, and 3 months after intervention. The data were analyzed using the chi-square test. RESULTS: A 1-month after intervention, there were significant differences in dysosmia, epistaxis, and nasal adhesion between the intervention and control groups. A 3-month after intervention, only olfactory disturbances were significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Nasal irrigation helps reduce the incidence of complications such as epistaxis and nasal adhesions in the early postoperative period. It can also promote the elimination or reduction of olfactory disturbances.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The causative agent of COVID-19 is a novel member of coronaviridaes, SARS-CoV-2. It has been reported that the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible of infectivity. The S protein is demonstrated to be inactivated under environmental condition, such as hypertonicity and alkaline pH. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of hypertonic alkaline nasal irrigation (HANI) on SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Sixty patients divided into two groups. The patients in Group 1 used hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and the patients in Group 2 used HCQ and HANI. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected at the beginning, on 3rd and 7th day of the PCR test positivity. The nasopharyngeal viral load (NVL) changes analyzed with quantitative PCR. RESULTS: NVL decrease in weekly period was statistically significant for both groups, when the difference between NVL day 0 and 3rd in Group 1 and NVL difference between day 0 and 3rd in Group 2 were compared. The difference between Groups 1 and 2 in terms of NVL change was statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated a significant decrease in nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 load with HANI solution and suggest that HANI may be promising modality for the COVID-19 treatment.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: High-volume corticosteroid nasal irrigation is a treatment option in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. In Brazil, alternatives are used to optimize its cost and popularize its use, such as 1% compounded budesonide drops or betamethasone cream, and it is necessary to study these treatment modalities. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical response of nasal irrigation with 1% compounded budesonide drops or betamethasone cream compared to nasal sprays utilized in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study with 257 patients. One hundred and eight patients using corticosteroid nasal irrigation (292 treatment cycles) and 149 using corticosteroid nasal spray (300 treatment cycles) were included. Evaluation of subjective improvement, adverse events, exacerbations, and objective assessments with SNOT-22 and Lund-Kennedy endoscopic score were performed, in addition to sub-analyses related to nasal polyps and previous surgery. RESULTS: Corticosteroid nasal irrigation and corticosteroid nasal spray improved the Lund-Kennedy endoscopic score, with more adverse events in the corticosteroid nasal irrigation group. Previous surgery increased corticosteroid nasal irrigation improvement, with greater subjective improvement and fewer exacerbations. 1% compounded budesonide drops were better than betamethasone cream in the Lund-Kennedy endoscopic score, with fewer adverse events. A 1,000 µg dose of 1% compounded budesonide drops was more effective than 500 µg. CONCLUSION: Corticosteroid nasal irrigation was effective in improving the Lund-Kennedy endoscopic score in chronic rhinosinusitis, especially in patients with nasal polyps and previous surgery, in addition to promoting a higher rate of subjective improvement and fewer exacerbations than corticosteroid nasal spray, but with more adverse events. 1% compounded budesonide drops improved the Lund-Kennedy endoscopic score with fewer adverse events than betamethasone cream, particularly at higher doses (1000 µg).",

This study aimed to explore the effect of specific subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and nasal irrigation on CRSwAR after ESS. Sixty-four patients who were diagnosed as CRSwAR and received ESS were enrolled and divided into groups A, B, and C to receive different postoperative treatment strategies (conventional medication, medication with nasal irrigation, and medication with nasal irrigation and SCIT), and their prognosis was evaluated by scoring, electron microscopy, and inflammatory factors. One year after ESS, the recurrence rate of group C was significantly reduced; and the scoring from baseline was significantly different among the three groups, which of group C were the best. The epithelium arrangement, cilia morphology, and inflammation of nasal mucosa in each group were better than those in the preoperative state; and those in group C were the best. After one year, the expression levels of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), interleukin (IL)-8, and IL-17 in group B were lower than those of group A; and the expression levels of ECP, IL-8, IL-25, IL-33, IL-17 in group C were lower than those in group A. SCIT combined with nasal irrigation can improve the patients' symptoms and quality of life, promote the epithelialization of the mucosa in the surgical cavity, regulate the local immune response of the nasal cavity; thus improve the prognosis of patients with ESS after 1 year.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of HOCl nasal irrigation to reduce allergic rhinitis (AR) symptoms compared with saline nasal irrigation. METHODS: This was multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Initially, 139 patients with perennial AR were enrolled; however, 25 did not successfully complete the study. Patients were randomly assigned to the nasal irrigation with low-concentration HOCl (n = 55) or normal saline (n = 59) treatment groups for the 4-week study period. Participants completed the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) at every visit (baseline, Weeks 2 and 4), and Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) was determined before and after nasal irrigation every morning and evening. RESULTS: We found that RQLQ scores significantly decreased after 4 weeks in the HOCl and placebo groups, but the decrement of the RQLQ score was similar between the 2 groups. Additionally, TNSS improved in both groups between baseline and Week 4, whereas there were no significant differences in the change of TNSS between the 2 groups. The HOCl group did not show any clinical side effects related to nasal irrigation. CONCLUSION: Allergic symptoms significantly decreased with low-concentration HOCl nasal irrigation, without significant adverse events. However, HOCl showed no additional improvement in symptoms compared with saline nasal irrigation for patients with perennial AR.",

Generally, there are few complications due to nasal irrigation, and it is recognized as a highly safe treatment. There are no reports of nasal septal perforation due to nasal irrigation. The objective of this study was to describe three cases of nasal septal perforation occurring during self-nasal irrigation after ESS. Case patient 1 was a 38-year-old woman who was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of nasal obstruction. Based on a diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis and allergic rhinitis, we performed bilateral ESS and bilateral inferior turbinectomy. At discharge, we instructed the patient in how to perform self-nasal irrigation twice a day at home. At the time of the third visit after discharge, a black crust had adhered to the bilateral anterior nasal septum. Crust formation continued at the same site, and nasal septal perforation was seen two and a half months after the operation. The other two cases showed similar courses. Postoperative nasal irrigation can cause nasal septal perforation. We need to educate patients on proper nasal irrigation and regularly check the nasal septum.",

      "abstract": "Nasal irrigation is a widely recognized treatment for several sinonasal diseases. However, there is a lack of clear evidence-based guidelines for optimal irrigation delivery to improve lavage and topical drug delivery. This study uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to assess the effects of different head tilt positions on sinonasal coverage, residence time and shear stresses in squeeze-bottle nasal irrigation. A sinonasal cavity computational model was constructed from a high-resolution CT scan of a healthy, 25-year-old Asian female. The Volume of Fluid method was used to track the interface between the two immiscible fluids (air and water). The direction of gravity was varied to simulate different head tilt-positions (0° Straight, 45° Forward, 45° Left, 45° Right and 45° Backward) during nasal irrigation with 150 mL liquid via a squeeze bottle through the left nostril for 2 s with a 0.1 s acceleration/deceleration time. The results showed that the 45° backward head tilt position was the most effective in delivering irrigation to the ethmoid, frontal and sphenoid sinuses. Altering head tilt had minimal impact on irrigation delivery to the maxillary sinuses. Maximum wall shear stresses seen in localized areas of the sinus mucosa varied significantly with different head tilt angles. However, the difference in mean wall shear stress on the sinus surfaces was marginal with changing head tilt position. The findings suggest that an optimized head tilt position can be identified to improve liquid irrigation to targeted sinuses, as per treatment requirements (lavage and topical drug delivery).",

AIM OF THE STUDY: We developed a licorice extract (LE) by using glycyrrhiza glabra and administered it through nasal irrigation to treat allergic rhinitis (AR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: LE was prepared into extract powder, and the anti-inflammatory effect of the LE was evaluated by calcium ionophore-induced activated mast cell model (in vitro). Then, local passive anaphylaxis assays were applied to investigate the anti-IgE-mediated allergic reaction of the LE in mice (in vivo). A developed LE was administered through nasal irrigation to treat AR in clinic settings. A total of 60 participants diagnosed with AR were included in this clinical trial; they were randomly assigned to three interventions: licorice nasal irrigation (LNI), corticosteroid nasal irrigation (CNI), and saline nasal irrigation (SNI). They performed nasal irrigation once a day for 1 month. Both subjective questionnaires (22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test [SNOT-22] and visual analog scale [VAS]) and objective examinations (acoustic rhinometry and nasal endoscopy) were used for effectiveness assessments. RESULTS: All three interventions could improve SNOT-22 scores, but the effects of LNI and CNI were more significant. According to VAS scores for nasal blockage, rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal pruritus, postnasal discharge, and olfactory disturbance, the effect of LNI was superior to those of CNI and SNI. The results of rhinometry revealed that LNI significantly improved nasal resistance. Endoscopic analysis showed that both LNI and CNI, but not SNI, could significantly improve turbinate hypertrophy. Moreover, the best procedural comfort was found for LNI, which had no side effects or complications during the trial. CONCLUSIONS: LNI is a natural, safe, and innovative therapy that can effectively treat AR. Its effect is superior to those of CNI and SNI, and it has greatly improved procedural comfort.",

Through nasal irrigation, the related preparation of HC is beneficial for treating rhinosinusitis or promoting recovery after an endoscopic sinus surgery. However, it remains controversial whether nasal irrigation with HC preparation can provide evidence-based clinical benefits for rhinosinusitis patients. METHODS: With reference to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), 8 databases are perused to perform a methodical investigation of nasal irrigation with HC preparation and health-related results amongst rhinosinusitis patients. The main research purpose is to determine the influence of PRISMA standards on medical results pertaining to rhinosinusitis patients, including quantitative symptom recording and effective rate. With reference to the Cochrane Handbook, quality assessment of qualified papers is conducted using the Cochrane Risk Assessment Tool. RESULTS: The results will be publicised through a peer-reviewed journal publication. CONCLUSION: The results of the systematic review will summarise evidences for the efficacy of nasal irrigation with HC preparation in rhinosinusitis treatment.

RESULTS: Four hundred eighteen patients were enrolled in this study: 76 with acute viral rhinosinusitis (18%), 53 with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (13%), 156 with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (37%), and 133 with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (32%). We found that high-volume devices were most effective in helping to clear secretion in patients with acute viral rhinosinusitis, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (P = .017, .009, .002, respectively) and in reducing post-nasal drip in those with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (P = .040). There were no statistically significant differences among devices in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. CONCLUSIONS: Nasal irrigation with high-volume devices was an effective treatment for rhinosinusitis and was more effective at clearing nasal secretion and reducing post-nasal drip than that with other types of devices. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2C."

In addition, nasal irrigation as an adjuvant therapy also provides a satisfactory result. OBJECTIVE: To compare the treatment outcome in adults majority with intermittent allergic rhinitis who receive different concentrations of nasal irrigation. METHODS: The prospective randomized double-blind study was performed in 80 patients. All patients were prescribed oral antihistamine and nasal irrigated solution between 3% NaCl and 0.9% NaCl. Nasal congestion and rhinorrhea were evaluated at baseline, first and second weeks after treatment. Assessments were measured by nasal congestion visual analog scale rhinorrhea visual analog scale, inferior turbinate size, and peak nasal expiratory flow rate (PNEFR). A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: There were 40 patients in each group of the study. Patients reported satisfactory experience after using saline irrigation at first and second weeks in both solutions (p value < 0.001). However, when compared between groups, no significant differences for all parameters were reported. PNEFR showed good results after the first week of 3% NaCl irrigation (p value = 0.001), while 0.9% NaCl had good results after the second week (p value < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Both add-on treatments have a significant improvement of all 4 parameters assessed in the study: nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, inferior turbinate size and PNEFR. Of note, 3% NaCl but not 0.9 NaCl had improved the PNEFR earlier from 1 week of the treatment.",

Saline water gargling and nasal irrigation represent simple, economical, practically feasible, and globally implementable strategies with therapeutic and prophylactic value. These methods, rooted in the traditional Indian healthcare system, are suitable and reliable in terms of infection control and are relevant examples of harmless interventions.

For this purpose, 100 patients of intermittent allergic rhinitis admitted to our hospital from January 2018 to January 2020. Randomly divided into a control group (n=50) and an observation group (n=50). The control group was given oral desloratadine citrate disodium. The observation group was given physiological seawater nasal irrigation based on the control group. Both groups were treated for one month. Compare the effect of treatment, symptom and sign scores pre and posttreatment, serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, serum interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-6, IL-13 and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) levels, peripheral blood helper T cells 1 (Th1) and Th2 and the recurrence rate of patients after 1 year between two groups. Results showed that after one month of continuous treatment, the total effective rate of the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P &lt;0.05). The symptoms and signs scores and serum IgE levels of the two groups pretreatment (before treatment) were not significantly different (P &gt; 0.05). The symptoms and signs scores and serum IgE levels of the two groups decreased significantly posttreatment (after treatment) (P &lt;0.05), and the observation group was significantly lower than the control group (P &lt;0.05). Pretreatment, the levels of serum inflammatory factors (IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, and IFN-γ) and the ratio of peripheral blood Th1 and Th2 to CD4+T cells were not significantly different (P&gt; 0.05). After one month of continuous treatment, the levels of serum IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, and the ratio of peripheral blood CD4+IL-4+/CD4+ in the observation group and the control group were significantly reduced and the ratio of CD4+IFN-γ+/CD4+ was significantly increased (P &lt;0.05). Compared with the control group, those changes were more obvious in the observation group (P &lt;0.05). The one-year recurrence rate of the observation group was 4% (2/50), which was significantly lower than that of the control group, which was 20% (10/50). There was a statistical difference between the two groups (P &lt;0.05). It was concluded that oral desloratadine citrate disodium combined with physiological seawater nasal irrigation can effectively improve the symptoms and signs of intermittent allergic rhinitis and reduce the recurrence rate. This may be related to balancing T cell responses, promoting systemic Th1 responses and inhibiting Th2 responses, and down-regulating inflammatory response.",

This technique is intended for children over the age of 6 months, as it requires an oral breathing reflex and cough reflex that are not systematically acquired before this age. Nasal irrigation is performed on a 30° upward inclined plane on a calm and cooperative child, away from meals. The child is maintained gently, without pressure, in the fencing position with the head turned away from the practitioner. Using a continuous flow spray, the practitioner grasps the top of the upper nostril and irrigates the nostril for an average of 3 s (6mL per nostril). These steps are then repeated until satisfactory patency is achieved in both nostrils. This technique constitutes a practical tool to help healthcare professionals and parents perform nasal irrigation in young children over the age of 6 months.",

METHODS: Fifty-two patients, divided into two groups (n = 26 in the \"Xylitol\" group and n = 26 in the \"Saline solution\" group) answered questionnaires validated in Portuguese (NOSE and SNOT-22) about their nasal symptoms and general symptoms, before and after endonasal endoscopic surgery and after a period of 30 days of nasal irrigation. RESULTS: The \"Xylitol\" group showed significant improvement in pain relief and nasal symptom reduction after surgery and nasal irrigation with xylitol solution (p < 0.001). The \"Saline solution\" group also showed symptom improvement, but on a smaller scale. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the xylitol solution can be useful in the postoperative period after endonasal endoscopic surgery, because it leads to a greater reduction in nasal symptoms.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Currently, several different concentrations of saline are recommended for use in nasal irrigation. Increasing studies show that nasal irrigation with hypertonic saline is more effective than traditional saline in the treatment of rhinosinusitis, but there have been few systematic analyses of the effect of nasal irrigation with hypertonic saline on chronic rhinosinusitis. OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the effects of hypertonic saline and isotonic saline in the treatment of rhinosinusitis in order to provide a reference for clinical nasal irrigation for chronic rhinosinusitis treatment. METHODS: Medline, cochrane library, EMBASE, PubMed, Chinese biomedical journal database, China national knowledge infrastructure, Wanfang database, and other databases were searched, and the searching was supplemented by manual searches for relevant references to treatment of rhinosinusitis by saline nasal irrigation. The last retrieval date was March 2018. The included studies were evaluated for quality, and data were extracted for meta-analysis using RevMan 5.3. RESULTS: Seven studies were included. Effects favoring hypertonic saline on nasal symptoms were greater in 4 subgroups. These were (1) patients with nasal secretion (SMD=1.52; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.00; p<0.01), (2) patients with congestion (SMD=1.52; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.00; p<0.01), (3) patients with headache (SMD=0.82; 95% CI: 0.38, 1.26; p<0.01), (4) patients with overall symptomatic relief (SMD=1.63; 95% CI: 0.83, 2.44; p<0.01). However, no difference was shown in smell improvement (SMD=0.47; 95% CI: -0.65, 1.59; p=0.41) and radiologic scores improvement (SMD=2.44; 95% CI: -3.14, 8.02; p<0.01). Besides, hypertonic saline showed greater improvement in mucociliary clearance time scores than did the isotonic saline group (SMD=1.19; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.60; p<0.01). Hypertonic saline brought greater minor adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Compared with isotonic saline, hypertonic saline nasal irrigation for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis is significantly more effective and has mild side effects in improving nasal symptoms and ciliary movement, but there is no significant difference in imaging findings and smell improvement. Although hypertonic saline is worthy of widespread use in clinical practice, it is still necessary to further study the exact manner and concentration of nasal irrigation.",

Its application in treatment of allergic rhinitis has not been previously studied. This study assesses the subjective and clinical response to budesonide buffered hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and hypertonic saline nasal irrigation in patients with allergic rhinitis. STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective, single-center, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients diagnosed with allergic rhinitis were randomized into 2 groups to receive either buffered hypertonic saline nasal irrigation with a placebo respule or buffered hypertonic saline nasal irrigation with a budesonide respule. Patients were assessed at baseline and 4 weeks subjectively using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) questionnaire and visual analog scale (VAS). Clinical assessment was done using the modified Lund-Kennedy score. RESULTS: The average SNOT-22, VAS, and modified Lund-Kennedy scores improved in both groups (P < .001). The budesonide irrigation group was found to have significantly better improvement than the saline nasal irrigation group with the SNOT-22 scores (P = .012) and VAS scores (P = .007). However, the difference in the clinical response between the 2 groups was not significant (P = .268). CONCLUSION: This study adds evidence to the use of saline nasal irrigation in allergic rhinitis but also demonstrates efficacy of the addition of budesonide to irrigations. Budesonide nasal irrigation thus appears to be a viable treatment option for allergic rhinitis.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Acute upper respiratory tract infections are the most common infections in infants and children. Saline nasal irrigation (SNI) is widely prescribed and recommended. We conducted a systematic review to assess the efficacy and safety of SNI in infants and children with acute rhinopharyngitis. METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, Medline, Embase and clinicalTrials.gov. Two authors selected randomized control trials (RCTs), including infants ≥3 months and children ≤12 years, comparing the use of isotonic saline solutions, whatever their mode of administration, with one therapeutic abstention, or a therapy deemed less important for nasal lavage. Trial quality was assessed independently by two authors, who, with a third author, extracted and analysed data. Statistical analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. The standard difference in means (SMD) between groups and its 95% confidence interval were estimated. RESULTS: Four RCTs (569 participants) were included. The analysis showed a benefit of SNI for certain clinical rhinological symptoms (SMD = -0.29 [-0.45; -0.13]) but no significant improvement of respiratory symptoms (SMD = -0.19 [-0.70; 1.08]) or health status (SMD = -0.30 [-0.68; 0.07]). Its use appeared to limit the prescription of other treatments, whether local or systemic, and particularly antibiotics. Long-term use led to a decrease in the incidence of acute rhinosinusitis and its complications. SNI appeared to be a safe treatment. CONCLUSIONS: SNI is beneficial for rhinological symptoms but not respiratory symptoms. Further research is needed to address the full benefits/risks of this treatment.",

METHODS: An open-label, controlled, non-randomized, real-life study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of NI with a new hypertonic solution as add-on treatment for AR. Children and adolescents with AR were prescribed symptomatic treatment. The active group also received an additional sea-water NI solution supplemented with algae extracts. The primary endpoint was symptom control, assessed by the control of allergic rhinitis and asthma test (CARAT) questionnaires. Moreover, the MASK/Allergy Diary was used to track symptoms and daily medication use that were combined in a novel total symptom/medication score (TSMS). RESULTS: We assessed 76 patients. Overall, there was a significant improvement of CARAT results (median Z-score change of 1.1 in the active/NI group vs. 0.4 in the control group; p = 0.035). Among patients > 12 years old (n = 51), there was a significant improvement in CARAT10 results among participants receiving NI (21.0 to 25.5; p < 0.001), but not in the regular treatment group (21.5 to 24.0; p = 0.100). For children < 12 years old (n = 25), the ΝΙ group had significantly improved symptom control (CARATKids results: 5.0 to 2.0; p = 0.002), in contrast to the control group (4.0 to 2.5; p = 0.057). MASK data on allergic symptoms were comparable between groups. However, the NI group had lower TSMS, more days with < 20% symptoms and fewer days using symptomatic treatment (26.9% vs. 43.5%; p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Addition of NI with a sea-water solution to regular treatment improved AR symptom control. CARAT questionnaires and MASK application can be useful outcome tools in real-life studies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Delivery of topical pharmacotherapy to the paranasal sinuses remains integral to the management of chronic rhinosinusitis. The frontal sinus remains a difficult access site for irrigations, often limited by its position relative to the nostril and ethmoid sinus. In view of the previous demonstration of improved frontal sinus irrigation with Draf III vs Draf IIa, in this work we sought to evaluate topical access of Draf IIb relative to Draf IIa and Draf III modification of the frontal sinus outflow tract. METHODS: Unfixed human cadaver heads were dissected using Draf IIa, Draf IIb, and Draf III frontal sinusotomies. Draf IIa, Draf IIb, and Draf III frontal sinusotomies were performed in progressive sequence on each cadaver head. Nasal irrigation fluid access to the frontal sinus was tested after each successive frontal sinus intervention. Irrigations were performed using Frankfort horizontal and vertex positioning. Blinded reviewers were then asked to evaluate nasal irrigation access based on an ordinal scale. RESULTS: Eight cadaveric specimens (age, 78 ± 12.3 years; 62.5% female) were assessed. The greatest distribution scores were recorded by Draf III, then IIb, and then IIa (90.7% vs 81.3% vs 50.1%; p < 0.001). Similarly, the rate of lavage was greatest with Draf III (50% vs 12.5% vs 12.5%). Vertex positioning and increasing volume trended toward improved distribution but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Adequate delivery of topical therapy to the paranasal sinuses by nasal irrigation remains critical in the postoperative state. Although increasing the dimensions of the frontal recess improves nasal irrigation delivery, the Draf III procedure provides the optimal delivery of pharmacotherapy in those with frontal sinus disease.",

      "abstract": "Nasal irrigation is an effective and cheap method in managing post sinonasal surgery patients. It works by improving ciliary clearance and performing mechanical debridement of the thick crust, decreasing mucosal edema and reducing the inflammatory mediators. Presence of nasal irrigation bottle contamination and its effect on patients have been studied. The aim of this study is to prospectively identify the risk of contamination in the nasal irrigation bottle, fluid from the bottle and to correlate with endoscopic findings from the patients who had underwent sinonasal surgery. Swabs will be taken from the nasal irrigation bottle and patient's middle meatus before the surgery and at each post surgery visits (2 and 4 weeks). Patients will be advised to irrigate their nose three times per day post sinonasal surgery. During endoscopic examination of the patient's nasal cavity at 2 and 4 weeks, any evidence of infection will be noted and documented. Additionally, a swab of fluid irrigated from the nasal cavity collected during the clinic follow-ups will also be taken. The specimens will be sent to the Microbiology laboratory for standard culture and sensitivity test. A total of 27 patients completed the study and were divided into case (n = 15) and control (n = 12) groups. The CFU (colony-forming unit) value of the bacteria cultured from the nasal cavity and the nasal irrigation bottle was statistically significantly (P = 0.00) increased from the baseline to the second week follow-up in both groups but not from the second week to the fourth week follow-up. The majority of the swabs from the nasal cavity of the patients and the nasal irrigation bottles were positively cultured for Pseudomonas sp. group. Other groups of bacteria that were cultured were Enterobacter sp., Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (CONS) and Klebsiella sp. Endoscopically, there was no clinical evidence of infection found in the nasal cavity of the patients. The nasal irrigation bottle that was used in the post sinonasal surgery treatment and for alleviation of symptoms of sinonasal diseases was found to have bacterial contamination from the swabs taken from the bottle. However, despite this finding there was not clinical evidence of infection noted from the nasal endoscopic examination. A simple and effective method of cleaning the bottle would be helpful to reduce the bacterial contamination for this useful treatment method."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nasal irrigation is now widely recognized as a treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis and during the postoperative period. However, there are no guidelines for performing irrigation. This study used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation objective physical parameters to optimize and increase the efficiency of nasal irrigation and to compare large-volume, manual, and gravity pressure irrigation vs small-volume continuous spraying. METHODS: A 3-dimensional (3D) sinonasal model was constructed from a healthy adult high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan. The 3D nasal model was constructed using a tetrahedral and hex-dominant mesh grid with TGRID™ 16 (ANSYS Inc., Villeurbanne, France) software. A structured hex mesh was created inside the domain using the Hexcore meshing method. The final mesh had a total of 9.6 × 106 cells with an average size of 0.29 mm3 , or an average volume of 2.42 × 10-2 mm3 . Navier-Stokes equations were resolved with the standard k - ε  model. RESULTS: Large-volume irrigation (15 mL/s) covered all zones (136 to 310 cm2 ) rapidly with strong shear stress and prolonged contact time (310 mPa 3.26 seconds for gravity mode and 280 mPa 3.35 seconds for manual pressure mode). Continuous spraying (3 mL/second) covered all areas (76 to 310 cm2 ) but with far less volume, more slowly, with low shear stress (50 mPa), and with shorter contact time (1.84 seconds). The surface wetted by time in contact was 135.4, 113.9, and 46.6 cm2 for gravity, manual pressure mode, and continuous spraying, respectively. CONCLUSION: CFD simulation visualizes the circulation of water during nasal irrigation and makes it possible to determine objective parameters to decide which mode of irrigation may be used.",

STUDY DESIGN: An interventional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Dow University Hospital, Dow International Medical College, DUHS, Karachi, from June 2015 to June 2017. METHODOLOGY: All adult patients having nasal polyps, who had not undergone any previous nasal surgery, were included in the study. Patients aged under 18 years, history of granulomatous diseases, immunosuppression, invasive fungal sinusitis, and pregnant ladies were excluded from the study. The ratio was kept as 1:2; one receiving irrigation with amphotericin B and the other only saline nasal irrigation without the medicine. After surgery, the patients were divided into two groups; 58 patients were in the placebo group and 29 in the amphotericin group. Serum IgE levels were documented before and one month postoperative treatment. Serum IgE level of more than 250 ng/ml was taken as a high value. All the patients were followed for six months. Recurrence was defined as the recurrence of nasal symptoms and recurrence of mucosal thickening based on repeat CT scan. Frequency tables and cross tabulations using Chi-square test were performed with p-values of 0.05 taken as significant were performed on different variables. RESULTS: A total of 87 patients were inducted. Overall 22 (25.3%) patients had recurrence of symptoms at six-month followup visit. Twelve (13.7%) of these were in the placebo group and 10 (11.5%) were in the amphotericin B nasal irrigation group. Serum IgE level preoperatively ranged between 52 - 9344 ng/dl; postoperatively it ranged from 13-1050 ng/dl. When pre and postoperative serum IgE level were compared with each other and CT scan scores, using Chi-square test, the difference was significant (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Amphotericin B improved the CT scan score of the patients. The nasal irrigation of amphotericin B did not show significant change in the recurrence pattern of chronic sinuses with polyps. Serum IgE can be used as marker for the presence and response to treatment for non-invasive fungal sinusitis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nasal irrigation is widely used as an adjunctive treatment for nasal diseases. There is little evidence regarding the efficacy of the devices used in this procedure. The objective of this survey was to evaluate the effectiveness of nasal irrigation devices based on the experiences of patients and physicians. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre survey study between November 2017 and October 2018. Physician and patient questionnaires were developed based on the available literature and expert opinion. The physician questionnaire was submitted to the Otolaryngology residents and staff of each centre and their network. The physicians were also asked to distribute the patient questionnaire to their patients. RESULTS: Information regarding 331 devices used by the patients was collected. The mean age of the patients was 45.46 ± 17.19 years (from 5 to 81). Roughly half were male, and half were female (48.6%: 51.4%). Among the high-pressure devices, we found that the high-pressure large-volume nasal irrigation devices yielded significantly higher symptom scores in seven of 12 domains (p < 0.05). Among the large-volume devices, we found that the large-volume high-pressure nasal irrigation devices received significantly higher symptom scores in 4 of 12 domains (p < 0.05). However, a higher proportion of patients using the large-volume high-pressure devices had retained fluid in the sinuses compared to those using large-volume low-pressure devices (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This survey supports the regular use of nasal irrigation, particularly with large-volume high-pressure devices, as an effective treatment for nasal disease. It may be effective at clearing nasal secretion, improve nasal congestion, decrease post-nasal drip, improve sinus pain or headache, improve taste and smell, and improve sleep quality. It could be used by patients with good compliance and minimal side effects."

METHODS: A multicentric, prospective, randomised, double-blind, parallel group study was conducted on 56 consecutive patients who underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps. Group 1 received the standard therapy of normal saline; group 2 received saline plus sodium hyaluronate. RESULTS: Both objective and subjective measurements, in terms of endoscopic appearance and patient-reported satisfaction, were significantly better in group 2 compared to group 1.

As we have evidence of chloride-ion dependent innate antiviral response in epithelial cells, we conducted a pilot, non-blinded, randomised controlled trial of hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling (HSNIG) vs standard care on healthy adults within 48 hours of URTI onset to assess recruitment (primary outcome). Acceptability, symptom duration and viral shedding were secondary outcomes. Participants maintained a symptom diary until well for two days or a maximum of 14 days and collected 5 sequential mid-turbinate swabs to measure viral shedding. The intervention arm prepared hypertonic saline and performed HSNIG. We recruited 68 participants (2.6 participants/week; November 2014-March 2015). A participant declined after randomisation. Another was on antibiotics and hence removed (Intervention:32, Control:34). Follow up data was available from 61 (Intervention:30, Control:31). 87% found HSNIG acceptable, 93% thought HSNIG made a difference to their symptoms. In the intervention arm, duration of illness was lower by 1.9 days (p = 0.01), over-the-counter medications (OTCM) use by 36% (p = 0.004), transmission within household contacts by 35% (p = 0.006) and viral shedding by ≥0.5 log10/day (p = 0.04).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown controversial results of topical amphotericin B (AMB) nasal irrigation for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 200 μg/mL AMB nasal irrigation as an adjuvant therapy after functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). METHODS: Patients with CRS who had received FESS for treatment were recruited and assigned to 1 of 2 groups at random at 1 month postsurgery. In the AMB group patients received nasal irrigation with 200 μg/mL of AMB for 2 months on a daily basis. In the control group normal saline irrigation was given instead. Before FESS and before and after nasal irrigation, patients' sinonasal symptoms were assessed through a questionnaire that was a Taiwanese version of the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (TWSNOT-22). In addition, patients received endoscopic examination, acoustic rhinometry, smell test, saccharine transit test, and bacterial cultures obtained from their middle meati. RESULTS: A total of 73 patients completed the study between December 2014 and January 2017. Among them, 37 received nasal irrigation with AMB solution, and 36 with saline. In the AMB group, scores of TWSNOT-22 dropped significantly after irrigation compared with before (p = 0.005). In the control group, TWSNOT-22 scores did not changed after irrigation (p = 0.451). However, there were no significant differences in TWSNOT-22, endoscopic score, smell test, saccharine transit test, and bacterial culture rate after irrigation between 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that in post-FESS care, nasal irrigation with 200 μg/mL of AMB did not provide additional benefit compared with saline irrigation.",

The primary aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of 21-day use of buffered hypertonic saline (BHS) versus normal saline solution (NSS) on reducing nasal symptoms in children with seasonal AR (SAR). Comparing their efficacy on nasal cytology counts (NCC), quality of life, and sleep quality was the secondary aim. METHODS: In this 21-day, open-label, randomized controlled study, 36 SAR children (aged 6-13 years) with a Total 5 Symptom Score (T5SS) ≥5 received twice-daily BHS or NSS delivered through a nasal douche. Efficacy measures were least square mean changes (LSmc) in T5SS, NCC, Paediatric Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (PRQLQ), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores. RESULTS: BHS improved the T5SS total score to a greater extent than NSS (LSmc -6.45 vs. -5.45, p < 0.001). Concerning NCC, BHS significantly reduced the scores of neutrophils (LSmc -0.76, p = 0.004) and eosinophils (LSmc -0.46, p = 0.018), while NSS did not. Similarly, only BHS yielded a significant improvement in the PRQLQ score (LSmc -0.57, p = 0.009), whereas the improvement in PSQI score was comparable between the BHS (LSmc -0.77, p = 0.025) and NSS (LSmc -1.39, p < 0.001) groups. Overall, BHS was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In children with SAR, BHS is effective in improving nasal symptoms and NCC, with an associated beneficial effect on quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To observe the therapeutic effect of simple 3.0% saline nasal irrigation and combined treatment of 3.0% saline nasal irrigation and budesonide nasal spray for vasomotor rhinitis (VMR), and explore the long-term effect for VMR. Through examination of levels of substance P (SP) and mucin (MUC)5B in nasal lavage fluid, the mechanisms of nasal irrigation treatment for VMR was discussed. Methods: One hundred and one patients from Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University with VMR were randomly divided into 4 groups. The number of patients was 24 in control group, 25 in budesonide nasal spray treatment group (budesonide group), 25 in nasal irrigation treatment group (nasal irrigation group) and 27 in budesonide nasal spray + nasal irrigation group (combined treatment group). Control patients were left untreated. Budesonide group was under budesonide nasal spray treatment, nasal irrigation group was treated using 3.0% saline with a temperature of 40℃ and combined treatment group was given both treatments. The duration of the intervention period was 3 months (90 days). Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to evaluate nasal symptoms, and the health-related quality of life was assessed using the 12-item Short Form Health Survey version 2.0 (SF-12v2). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to assess the contents of SP and MUC5B in nasal lavage fluid before and after 3-month treatments in budesonide and nasal irrigation group in the study. MUC5B in nasal lavage fluid after the SP challenge and anticholinergic drug intervention in control group were also evaluated with ELISA. Results: Nighty out of 101 patients completed the study. In the budesonide and combined treatment group after relevant interventions, the total VAS score of nasal symptoms decreased (5.91±0.21 vs 3.82±0.15, 6.18±0.17 vs 3.92±0.15, t value was 8.193, 10.060, respectively, all P<0.05) and SF-12v2 score increased (146.00±1.23 vs 152.30±0.97, 146.00±1.08 vs 155.40±0.90, t value was 3.982, 6.697, respectively, all P<0.05), with both scores showed no significant differences in the nasal irrigation group (5.96±0.17 vs 5.72±0.15, 146.10±1.17 vs 147.00±0.94, t value was 1.038, 0.607, respectively, all P>0.05) after the first month. In the budesonide and combined treatment group after relevant interventions, the total VAS score of nasal symptoms decreased (5.91±0.21 vs 5.05±0.15, 6.18±0.17 vs 5.10±0.12, t value was 3.374, 5.351, respectively, all P<0.05) and SF-12v2 score increased (146.00±1.23 vs 150.90±0.76, 146.00±1.08 vs 153.60±0.94, t value was 3.373, 5.343, respectively, all P<0.05), with both scores showed no significant differences in the nasal irrigation group (5.96±0.17 vs 5.78±0.17, 146.10±1.17 vs 148.10±0.80, t value was 0.716, 1.438, respectively, all P>0.05) after the second month. By the end of the third month, in nasal irrigation and combined treatment group, the VAS score was diminished (5.96±0.17 vs 4.80±0.12, 6.18±0.17 vs 4.44±0.13, t value was 5.485, 8.264, respectively, all P<0.05) and SF-12v2 score was elevated (146.10±1.17 vs 150.80±0.96, 146.00±1.08 vs 152.90±0.85, t value was 3.163, 5.008, respectively, all P<0.05), but there were no significant differences in budesonide group (5.91±0.21 vs 5.68±0.18, 146.00±1.23 vs 148.40±0.85, t value was 0.819, 1.587, respectively, all P>0.05). Additionally, SP in nasal lavage fluid decreased and MUC5B showed no statistical changes in budesonide group after three months, however, SP showed no any changes and MUC5B reduced significantly in nasal lavage fluid in nasal irrigation group. Furthermore, the anticholinergic drug could not decrease the concentration of MUC5B after the SP challenge in nasal cavity in control group. Conclusions: The therapeutic effect of simple nasal irrigation with 3.0% saline or combined treatment of 3.0% saline nasal irrigation and nasal corticosteroids is superior to simple nasal corticosteroids. Nasal corticosteroids plays a role in the inhibition of sensory nerve endings in nasal mucosa, but neurotransmitter plays a limited role in the pathogenesis of VMR.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Abnormal mucus composition and bacterial biofilms are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of rhinosinusitis. Addition of a mucoactive surfactant to saline irrigation solution has been hypothesized to address these factors. We evaluated the safety and tolerability of a reformulated surfactant in a sample of normal subjects. METHODS: A total of 33 volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either surfactant solution or buffered saline at baseline in a controlled crossover study design. Each subject underwent rhinoscopic exam and in-office smell testing via the 40-question smell identification test (SIT). Those with non-normosmic results or active rhinitis symptoms were excluded. Subjects were instructed to irrigate twice daily with the selected solution for 1 week while keeping a daily diary. For week 2, treatment was stopped. During week 3, each group switched to the other treatment. Exam, SIT, and degree of congestion were assessed after each phase. RESULTS: Use of surfactant led to a marginal reduction in mean SIT score of 1.5 points, which was statistically significant (p = 0.012). A clinically meaningful reduction in SIT score, defined as ≥4 points, was observed in 18% (6/33) of subjects after surfactant vs 3% (1/33) after saline (p = 0.046). During the surfactant phase, moderate or severe congestion was reported in 29% (8/28) of subjects completing the diary. In contrast, only 6% (2/32) of subjects reported moderate congestion after the saline phase (p = 0.021). CONCLUSION: In normal volunteers, surfactant nasal irrigation may be associated with tolerability issues due to congestion. A subset may experience reduction in olfactory acuity that appears reversible.",

      "abstract": "Nasal irrigation (NI) is an old practice of upper respiratory tract care that likely originated in the Ayurvedic medical tradition. It is used alone or in association with other therapies in several conditions-including chronic rhinosinusitis and allergic rhinitis-and to treat and prevent upper respiratory tract infections, especially in children. However, despite it being largely prescribed in everyday clinical practice, NI is not included or is only briefly mentioned by experts in the guidelines for treatment of upper respiratory tract diseases. In this review, present knowledge about NI and its relevance in clinical practice is discussed to assist physicians in understanding the available evidence and the potential use of this medical intervention. Analysis of the literature showed that NI seems to be effective in the treatment of several acute and chronic sinonasal conditions. However, although in recent years several new studies have been performed, most of the studies that have evaluated NI have relevant methodologic problems. Only multicenter studies enrolling a great number of subjects can solve the problem of the real relevance of NI, and these studies are urgently needed. Methods for performing NI have to be standardized to determine which solutions, devices and durations of treatment are adequate to obtain favorable results. This seems particularly important for children that suffer a great number of sinonasal problems and might benefit significantly from an inexpensive and simple preventive and therapeutic measure such as NI.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with CRS were enrolled and symptoms were assessed by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 22 (SNOT-22). Nasal NO and iNOS mRNA in the right maxillary sinus were also examined. Then, they were treated with XNI (XNI group) or saline nasal irrigation (SNI, SNI group) for 30days, after which their symptoms were reassessed using VAS and SNOT-22, and nasal NO and iNOS mRNA in the right maxillary sinus were also reexamined. RESULTS: Twenty-five out of 30 patients completed this study. The scores of VAS and SNOT-22 were all reduced significantly after XNI treatment, but not after SNI. The concentrations of nasal NO and iNOS mRNA in the right maxillary sinus were increased significantly in XNI group. However, significant changes were not found after SNI treatment. Furthermore, there were statistical differences in the assessments of VAS and SNOT-22 and the contents of nasal NO and iNOS mRNA in the right maxillary sinus between two groups.

      "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) and upper airway respiratory infections are frequent in children, and both have a relevant impact on some social aspects, including school attendance and performance, sleep, quality of life (also of the parents), and costs. Saline nasal irrigation is widely employed to reduce nasal congestion and mucopurulent secretion, to stimulate cleansing of the nasal and paranasal cavities, and to induce restoration of mucociliary clearance. The present study evaluated the effects of nasal irrigation on nasal cytology, using the new device Nasir® in 66 children (40 males, 26 females, mean age 7.31±1.7 years, age range 4-17 years) with allergic rhinitis. The patients were treated with nasal irrigation with warm (36°C) Nasir® (250 mL sacs of premixed solution): one sac twice daily for 12 days. Nasal irrigation significantly reduced the neutrophilic infiltrate (baseline median value 2.8±0.7; post treatment value 2±0.5; p less than 0.05). In addition, there was a reduction of eosinophil infiltrate (T0= 3.2±1.1; T1= 2.6±1.2; p= less than 0.05). There was no significant change with regard to bacteria (T0= 2.7±0.9; T1= 2.3±1.02; p= 0.17). In conclusion, this pilot study reports that nasal irrigation with Nasir® might be useful to attenuate upper airway inflammation.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of HOCl irrigation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) refractory to medical therapy. Forty-three adult patients (mean age 45.5 years) were enrolled in this study. They were randomly chosen to receive nasal irrigation with either low-concentration HOCl generated by a Salicid device (n = 21), or a placebo (saline; n = 22) for 8 weeks. The outcome measures were scores on the 20-Item SinoNasal Outcome Test (SNOT-20), rhinosinusitis disability index (RSDI), nasal endoscopic score, and bacterial cultures. The SNOT-20 scores were significantly lower in the HOCl group than in the placebo group after 2 weeks of treatment (p < 0.05) and remained lower after 4 weeks of treatment. With respect to the RSDI scores, there was a significant improvement in the HOCl group at 1 week after treatment and in both groups at 2 weeks after treatment (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the endoscopic scores between the two groups after the treatment. The bacterial culture rates were lower in the HOCl group than in the placebo group after 4 weeks of treatment, but this was not significant (p > 0.05). Our results showed that low-concentration HOCl irrigation resulted in a greater improvement in CRS symptoms as compared to saline irrigation.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Budesonide nasal irrigation was introduced recently for postoperative management of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. The safety and therapeutic effectiveness of this procedure is becoming accepted by many physicians. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of postoperative steroid irrigation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and asthma. METHODS: This prospective study involved 12 chronic rhinosinusitis patients with nasal polyps and asthma who received oral steroid treatment for recurring or worsening disease. The 22-item Sinonasal Outcomes Test (SNOT-22) and Lund-Kennedy endoscopy scores were checked before nasal budesonide irrigation, and 1, 2, 4, and 6 months after irrigation. We also calculated the total amount of oral steroids and inhaled steroids in the 6 months before irrigation and the 6 months after it. RESULTS: The mean SNOT-22 score improved from 30.8±14.4 before irrigation to 14.2±8.7 after 6 months of irrigation (P=0.030). The endoscopy score also improved from 7.4±4.7 before irrigation to 2.2±2.7 after 6 months (P<0.001). The total amount of oral steroid was decreased from 397.8±97.6 mg over the 6 months before irrigation to 72.7±99.7 mg over the 6 months after irrigation (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Nasal irrigation with budesonide is an effective postoperative treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis with asthma, which recurs frequently, reducing the oral steroid intake."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews support nasal saline irrigation for chronic or recurrent sinus symptoms, but trials have been small and few in primary care settings. Steam inhalation has also been proposed, but supporting evidence is lacking. We investigated whether brief pragmatic interventions to encourage use of nasal irrigation or steam inhalation would be effective in relieving sinus symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic randomized controlled trial involving adults (age 18-65 yr) from 72 primary care practices in the United Kingdom who had a history of chronic or recurrent sinusitis and reported a \"moderate to severe\" impact of sinus symptoms on their quality of life. Participants were recruited between Feb. 11, 2009, and June 30, 2014, and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 advice strategies: usual care, daily nasal saline irrigation supported by a demonstration video, daily steam inhalation, or combined treatment with both interventions. The primary outcome measure was the Rhinosinusitis Disability Index (RSDI). Patients were followed up at 3 and 6 months. We imputed missing data using multiple imputation methods. RESULTS: Of the 961 patients who consented, 871 returned baseline questionnaires (210 usual care, 219 nasal irrigation, 232 steam inhalation and 210 combined treatment). A total of 671 (77.0%) of the 871 participants reported RSDI scores at 3 months. Patients' RSDI scores improved more with nasal irrigation than without nasal irrigation by 3 months (crude change -7.42 v. -5.23; estimated adjusted mean difference between groups -2.51, 95% confidence interval -4.65 to -0.37). By 6 months, significantly more patients maintained a 10-point clinically important improvement in the RSDI score with nasal irrigation (44.1% v. 36.6%); fewer used over-the-counter medications (59.4% v. 68.0%) or intended to consult a doctor in future episodes. Steam inhalation reduced headache but had no significant effect on other outcomes. The proportion of participants who had adverse effects was the same in both intervention groups. INTERPRETATION: Advice to use steam inhalation for chronic or recurrent sinus symptoms in primary care was not effective. A similar strategy to use nasal irrigation was less effective than prior evidence suggested, but it provided some symptomatic benefit. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, no. 88204146.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Effective mucus lavage and delivery of topical pharmaceuticals are central to successful management of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). The frontal sinus remains difficult to penetrate with topical therapies. This study evaluates the benefit of Draf III frontal dissection compared to traditional Draf IIa for distribution of topical therapies. METHODS: Fresh human cadaver heads were dissected sequentially with Draf IIa frontal sinusotomy and then Draf III procedures. Each cavity was irrigated with pediatric (120 mL) and adult (240 mL) irrigation bottles with 1/1000 10% fluorescein-labeled free water in 2 fixed positions (vertex and Frankfort horizontal). An endoscope at a fixed position within the frontal sinus recorded frontal sinus and frontal recess penetration. The images then underwent blinded evaluation of fluid distribution scored as 0 to 4 (nasal cavity only, frontal recess, medial one-half, lateral one-half, and lavage). Ordinal distribution score was analyzed with Kendall's tau-b. RESULTS: Eight specimens (age 76 ± 11.2 years; 50% female) were assessed. Draf III was superior to Draf IIa in ability to achieve frontal sinus distribution of irrigation (90.6% vs 50.1%, p < 0.001). Vertex head position improved distribution (90.6% vs 50.1%, p < 0.001), was synergistic with Draf III (100% with 87.5% lavage, p < 0.001), but was unable to overcome Draf IIa (81.2% with 25% lavage, p < 0.001). Irrigation volume trended toward improved distribution with larger volume irrigations. CONCLUSION: Successful treatment of sinonasal disease may require postoperative delivery of topical therapies. Draf III frontal sinusotomy achieves superior topical access, and access to the frontal sinus with Draf IIa appears limited, despite large volumes and positioning.",

Previous studies evaluated the efficacy of intranasal amphotericin B (AMB) in the treatment of patients with CRS, but the results were controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 100 μg/mL of AMB nasal irrigation as postoperative care after functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). METHODS: Patients with CRS who received FESS for treatment were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups at 1 month after surgery. Patients in the AMB group received 100 μg/mL of AMB nasal irrigation daily for 2 months, and those in the normal saline (NS) group received NS solution nasal irrigation daily for 2 months. Pre-FESS, pre-irrigation, and postirrigation sinonasal symptoms were assessed by questionnaires, and the patients received endoscopic examination, acoustic rhinometry, smell test, and saccharine transit test. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were enrolled between June 2012 and December 2014. Among the patients who completed the study, 38 received AMB irrigation, and 39 received NS solution irrigation. Although all the patients reported improvement after irrigation, there was no difference in outcome between patients who received AMB and those who received NS solution. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that nasal irrigation with 100 μg/mL of AMB did not confer a greater benefit than that of NS solution nasal irrigation in post-FESS care.",

METHODS: We randomly assigned 133 infants up one year of age, who were admitted to the emergency department with bronchiolitis and an oxygen saturation (SpO2) of between 88 and 94%, to the isotonic (n = 47), hypertonic (n = 44) or standard care (n = 42) groups. Variations in SpO2 and the wheeze, air exchange, respiratory rate, muscle use (WARM) respiratory distress score were recorded at zero, five, 15, 20 and 50 minutes. RESULTS: Five minutes after the intervention, the median SpO2 value (95%) in the isotonic group was higher than both the hypertonic (94%) and the standard care (93%) groups. The differences between the isotonic and standard treatment groups were statistically significant at each time point, while the hypertonic group only reached significantly higher values after 50 minutes.

The present review of the evidence-based literature sought objective arguments for optimization and efficacy. It emerged that large-volume low-pressure nasal douche optimizes the distribution and cleansing power of the irrigation solution in the nasal cavity. Ionic composition and pH also influence mucociliary clearance and epithelium trophicity. Seawater is less rich in sodium ions and richer in bicarbonates, potassium, calcium and magnesium than is isotonic normal saline, while alkaline pH and elevated calcium concentration optimized ciliary motility in vitro. Bicarbonates reduce secretion viscosity. Potassium and magnesium promote healing and limit local inflammation. These results show that the efficacy of nasal irrigation is multifactorial. Large-volume low-pressure nasal irrigation using undiluted seawater seems, in the present state of knowledge, to be the most effective protocol.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), including the common cold and rhinosinusitis, are common afflictions that cause discomfort and debilitation and contribute significantly to workplace absenteeism. Treatment is generally by antipyretic and decongestant drugs and sometimes antibiotics, even though most infections are viral. Nasal irrigation with saline is often employed as an adjunct treatment for URTI symptoms despite a relative lack of evidence for benefit in this clinical setting. This review is an update of the Cochrane review by Kassel et al, which found that saline was probably effective in reducing the severity of some symptoms associated with acute URTIs. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of saline nasal irrigation for treating the symptoms of acute URTIs. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1966 to July week 5, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to August 2014), CINAHL (1982 to August 2014), AMED (1985 to August 2014) and LILACS (1982 to August 2014). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical nasal saline treatment to other interventions in adults and children with clinically diagnosed acute URTIs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors (DK, BM) independently assessed trial quality with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and extracted data. We analysed all data using the Cochrane Review Manager software. Due to the large variability of outcome measures only a small number of outcomes could be pooled for statistical analysis. MAIN RESULTS: We identified five RCTs that randomised 544 children (three studies) and 205 adults (exclusively from two studies). They all compared saline irrigation to routine care or other nose sprays, rather than placebo. We included two new trials in this update, which did not contribute data of sufficient size or quality to materially change the original findings. Most trials were small and we judged them to be of low quality, contributing to an unclear risk of bias. Most outcome measures differed greatly between included studies and therefore could not be pooled. Most results showed no difference between nasal saline treatment and control. However, one larger trial, conducted with children, did show a significant reduction in nasal secretion score (mean difference (MD) -0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.48 to -0.14) and nasal breathing (obstruction) score (MD -0.33, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.19) in the saline group. However, a MD of -0.33 on a four-point symptom scale may have minimal clinical significance. The trial also showed a significant reduction in the use of decongestant medication by the saline group. Minor nasal discomfort and/or irritation was the only side effect reported by a minority of participants. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Nasal saline irrigation possibly has benefits for relieving the symptoms of acute URTIs. However, the included trials were generally too small and had a high risk of bias, reducing confidence in the evidence supporting this. Future trials should involve larger numbers of participants and report standardised and clinically meaningful outcome measures.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Gulf War Illness (GWI) affects 1 in 7 returned Persian Gulf War veterans. Quality-of-life impact is large; there is no cure. Chronic sinus symptoms and fatigue are common. Nasal irrigation with saline (NI-S) or xylitol (NI-X) improve sinus symptoms and fatigue in the general population. This trial will assess the effect of NI-S and NI-X on sinus and fatigue symptoms, economic outcomes and pro-inflammatory milieu among participants with GWI. METHODS: 75 participants (age 35 to 65 years, 25 in each of three arms) with GWI will be recruited from the Veteran's Administration and the community. They will use routine care for sinus symptoms and fatigue and be randomized to continued usual care alone or additional therapy with NI-S or NI-X. Participants will be able to adjust specific elements of the NI procedure. The primary outcome (Sinonasal Outcome Test, SNOT-20) and other self-reported assessments will occur at baseline, 8 and 26 weeks; lab assessment of pro-inflammatory cellular and cytokine profiles will occur at baseline and 26 weeks. Other outcomes will include fatigue-specific and overall health-related quality of life, pro-inflammatory cellular and cytokine profiles, cost-effectiveness and participant satisfaction. RESULTS: Baseline demographic and clinical data from the first 10 participants show effective participant recruitment, enrollment, randomization, retention and data collection. CONCLUSION: Early study conduct suggests that our participant-oriented approach will yield high rates of participant adherence and data capture, facilitating robust analysis. Results of this study will clarify the value of NI for chronic sinus symptoms and fatigue among patients with GWI. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01700725.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The efficacy of antibiotic therapy for acute sinusitis is controversial. This study aimed to compare the efficacies of amoxicillin with nasal irrigation and nasal irrigation alone for acute sinusitis in children. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, controlled study included 80 children aged 4-15 years with a clinical presentation of acute sinusitis. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either amoxicillin (80 mg/kg/day) in 3 divided doses orally for 14 days with saline nasal irrigation (for 5 days) and 0.25% phenylephrine (for 2 days) or the same treatment without amoxicillin. Clinical improvements in their initial symptoms were assessed on days 3, 14, 21, and 28. RESULTS: On day 3, patients in the amoxicillin with nasal irrigation group showed significant clinical improvement (P=0.001), but there was no significant difference in the degree of improvement between the amoxicillin with nasal irrigation and nasal irrigation alone groups during follow-up (P>0.05). In addition, no significant differences were seen in age, sex, and degree of improvement between groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: High-dose amoxicillin with saline nasal irrigation relieved acute sinusitis symptoms faster and more often than saline nasal irrigation alone. However, antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis confers only a small therapeutic benefit over nasal irrigation."

SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, which evaluated children younger than 18 years of age with acute sinusitis, defined as 10 to 30 days of rhinorrhea, congestion or daytime cough. We excluded trials of children with chronic sinusitis and allergic rhinitis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed each study for inclusion. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 662 studies identified through the electronic searches and handsearching, none met all the inclusion criteria. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence to determine whether the use of antihistamines, decongestants or nasal irrigation is efficacious in children with acute sinusitis. Further research is needed to determine whether these interventions are beneficial in the treatment of children with acute sinusitis.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the symptoms and lower airway inflammatory factors of patients with allergic rhinitis (AR), and to observe the effect of nasal irrigation in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. METHOD: Sixty-one cases diagnosed as AR after skin prick test (SPT)were selected and randomly divided into three groups: 17 patients in group A used nasal steroid spray; 21 cases in group B used nasal irrigation; 23 patients in group C combined ir rigation with nasal steroid. Before and after 3 months treatment, nasal visual analogue scale (VAS) score, rhino conjunctivtis quality of life questionnaire (RQLQ) score, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) values were observed and compared in each group. RESULT: Before treatment, there is no statistically difference between three groups (P > 0.05). After 3 months of treatment, VAS, RQLQ, FENO of all patients was significantly decreased (P < 0.05); VAS, RQLQ score was not significantly different among the three groups (P > 0.05), FENO value has no statistically significant difference between group A and group B (P > 0.05), but were less than that in group C (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Nasal irrigation can ameliorate nasal symptoms, improve quality of life, decrease lower airway inflammation of allergic rhinitis patients. Nasal irrigation is an effective treatment of allergic rhinitis. Nasal irrigation combined with nasal steroid can achieve more significant efficacy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study was designed to determine if the addition of large-volume, low-positive pressure nasal irrigations delivered with isotonic sodium chloride (hereinafter \"saline\") added to intranasal corticosteroid therapy improves quality of life and objective measures of nasal breathing in patients with allergic rhinitis when compared with intranasal corticosteroid alone. METHODS: A prospective, unblinded, single-arm pilot study was performed of patients with allergic rhinitis already on intranasal corticosteroid pharmacotherapy. Patients added large-volume low-pressure saline irrigation twice daily for 8 weeks to their ongoing regiment of nasal corticosteroid. Mini-Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of life Questionnaire (mRQLQ) assessment and nasal peak inspiratory flow (NPIF) were performed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were enrolled. Twice-daily nasal irrigation with isotonic saline significantly (p < 0.001) reduced mRQLQ scores, from 36.7 ± 20.48 (baseline) to 14.9 ± 11.03 (4 weeks) to 10.10 ± 10.65 (8 weeks). No significant changes were seen in NPIF, pattern use of nasal steroid use, or adverse events. CONCLUSION: Large-volume, low-positive pressure nasal irrigation with isotonic saline is an effective adjunctive therapy to improve quality of life in patients with allergic rhinitis already on intranasal corticosteroid therapy.
