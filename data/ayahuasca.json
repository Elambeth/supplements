      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Survivors face disability and psychiatric sequelae resulting from ischemia-induced cell death and associated neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Herbal medicines have been shown to elicit neuroprotective effects following stroke due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Preliminary evidence suggests that Ayahuasca (AYA), a decoction made from the vine Banisteriopsis caapi containing β-carbolines and the shrub Psychotria viridis containing N, N-Dimethyltryptamine, might attenuate ischemia-induced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Therefore, in this study we investigated the putative protective effects of AYA in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of ischemic stroke. METHODS: Wistar rats were subjected to the MCAO stroke model or sham surgery on day 0. After 24-h, rats were treated for three days with AYA (2 and 4 mL/kg, gavage) or saline. Neurological score was assessed for 72-h post-stroke. Rats were tested in the elevated plus maze, open field, and novel object recognition tests to assess locomotion, anxiety-like behavior, and recognition memory. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and the nitrite/nitrate (N/N) concentrations were determined in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HPC), hypothalamus (HYP) and cortex. as markers of inflammation. Oxidative stress was quantified in the same brain areas as measured by the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS), protein carbonylation, and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activity. Mitochondrial metabolism was assessed quantifying the activity of complex 1(CI), CII, citrate synthase (CS), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and creatine kinase (CK). RESULTS: No differences were observed regarding neurological deficits, locomotion, anxiety-like behavior, and recognition memory. However, AYA reversed the stroke-induced increase in IL-6 levels in the PFC and the HPC, IL-10 in the PFC, HPC, and HYP, MPO activity in the PFC, and N/N concentration and CAT activity in the HYP. Moreover, AYA decreased TBARS levels in the PFC and HPC and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the PFC, and increased SOD activity in the cortex. Lastly, AYA increased CI activity in the HPC and cortex and decreased SDH and CK activity in the HPC. CONCLUSION: AYA administration following ischemic stroke modulates oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in the PFC, HPC, and HYP. Despite no significant improvements in neurological or behavioral scores, these molecular changes suggest a neuroprotective role of AYA. Future studies should explore the timing of AYA treatment and putative long-term effects on functional recovery, as well as its potential in other brain regions critical for cognitive and motor functions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psychotherapy for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD), a condition characterized by an intense and persistent grief response, has received increased attention over the past decades. Evidence-based approaches to prevent PGD are currently scarce, and not always effective. This paper introduces a protocol for a clinical trial exploring the effectiveness of a Meaning Reconstruction psychotherapy approach (MR) assisted with ayahuasca, a traditional indigenous medicine. METHOD: The outlined protocol is a three-arm, non-randomized controlled trial focused on reducing normal and pathological grief symptoms, comparing the effectiveness of Ayahuasca-assisted MR therapy (A-MR), MR therapy alone (MR) and No Treatment (NT). At least 69 people who lost a first-degree relative during the prior year, and with a Texas Revised Inventory of Grief score up 39 (TRIG ≥ 40), will participate in the trial. Participants will be allocated to an A-MR (n ≥ 23), MR (n ≥ 23) or NT (n ≥ 23) group. Those from the A-MR and MR therapy groups will undergo a therapeutic process involving 9 sessions of online psychotherapy. In addition, the A-MR condition involves 2 group sessions of ayahuasca. The primary outcomes will be normal and pathological grief severity as measured by the TRIG and Traumatic Grief Inventory Self-Report (TGI-SR), administered at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow up. Measures of quality of life, post-traumatic growth, meaning-made, psychological flexibility, and self-belief consistency will be also included. In addition, subjective effects of ayahuasca and acceptance-avoidance promoting effects will be assessed following ayahuasca administration. Finally, we will analyze the potential mediating effect of meaning-made, psychological flexibility and self-belief consistency in grief symptoms (as measured by the TRIG and TGI). DISCUSSION: This trial is the first to empirically examinate the potential of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for grief, as well as the potential processes of change that may account for it.

      "abstract": "For decades, psychedelics have been investigated for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Specifically, evidence suggests that psychedelics may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of alcohol use disorder. Several studies with classic psychedelics, including LSD and psilocybin, show promising results, with psychedelics decreasing alcohol drinking and promoting abstinence in individuals with alcohol use disorder. In the last two decades, ayahuasca has emerged as another psychedelic with therapeutic potential for alcohol use disorder. Although its use by indigenous people from South America has been reported for thousands of years, ayahuasca, an Amazonian brewed beverage used in rituals, has gained attention in recent decades due to its reported effects in the central nervous system. Ayahuasca is a hallucinogenic beverage produced from the decoction of Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis, plants that contain β-carbolines and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), respectively. The majority of clinical studies investigating ayahuasca for the treatment of alcohol use disorder are retrospective, and all show a significant decrease in alcohol use among ayahuasca users. Corroborating the clinical evidence, pre-clinical studies also have demonstrated that ayahuasca can block several of the abuse-related effects of alcohol. This chapter reviews the accumulating evidence from clinical and pre-clinical studies suggesting that ayahuasca may be a promising new pharmacotherapy for the treatment of alcohol use disorders, and discusses the potential mechanisms involved in these and other effects of ayahuasca.",

      "abstract": "Ayahuasca is a brew traditionally prepared with a mixture of Psychotria viridis leaves and Banisteriopsis caapi vine and has demonstrated therapeutic properties for depression. Knowledge of the brew composition is important to improve the therapeutic potential and decrease side effects if ayahuasca becomes an option for refractory depression treatment. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) was applied to analyze 126 ayahuasca samples collected from different ayahuasqueiro groups and geographic origins. We were able to observe a differentiation in the metabolite composition of ayahuasca samples prepared by diverse ayahuasqueiro groups. These samples presented different antioxidant effects based on FRAP and ORAC assays. Exploratory statistical analysis demonstrated a trend of separating the samples according to the religious group. The most important identified compounds for differentiation of the brew prepared by distinct religious groups are glycosylated and/or phenolic compounds. The comparison based on the mode of ayahuasca preparation presented more variability than the comparison based on the botanical variety of B. caapi used. We conclude that ayahuasca samples prepared with \"caupuri\" or \"tucunacá\" separately exhibited differences in the analysis of L-glutamate and the metabolism of arginine and proline. This suggests that a possible variation in this pathway could explain the occurrence of swollen stem nodes in \"caupuri,\" one of the B. caapi varieties."

      "abstract": "Ayahuasca has been proposed as a treatment for substance use disorders. However, because of its hallucinogenic properties, studies investigating its abuse potential are needed. The aim of the present study was to investigate voluntary ayahuasca drinking in male mice using a two-bottle choice procedure. Male mice were exposed to two bottles, one of water and one of ayahuasca (0.01, 0.03 or 0.1 mg/ml), for 15 h/day, under 3 protocols (acquisition): (1) every other day access; (2) access every 3 days; (3) access every 5 days. Animals were then submitted to a 14-day drug-free period, followed by 3 re-exposure phases (same conditions as during acquisition), with 7 drug-free days between each. Regardless of the ayahuasca concentration, animals showed a preference for ayahuasca over water when exposed to ayahuasca every other day during the acquisition and re-exposure phases. Extending the period between ayahuasca exposures changed the expression of ayahuasca preference, with the longest break (every 5 days) being associated with preference for water over ayahuasca (i.e., ayahuasca aversion), an effect that was more predominantly observed at higher ayahuasca concentrations. A significant interaction was observed between frequency of exposure to ayahuasca and ayahuasca concentration for total ayahuasca intake during the later re-exposure phase. Our findings show that both the frequency of exposure and the ayahuasca concentration are critical when determining ayahuasca preference in a two-bottle choice model in mice, which can help guide therapeutic/ritualistic ayahuasca use.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Reports an error in \"Ayahuasca in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder: Mixed-methods case series evaluation in military combat veterans\" by Brandon Weiss, Lê-Anh L. Dinh-Williams, Nick Beller, Ian M. Raugh, Gregory P. Strauss and William K. Campbell (Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy, Advanced Online Publication, Dec 07, 2023, np). In the original article, there was an error in the calculations that led to the overstatement of the symptom severity of the veteran sample. Specifically, sum scores for the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom checklist (PCL-5) were scored using a 1-5 Likert scale rather than the appropriate 0-4 Likert scale. As a result, although it was stated that participants in the veteran sample exhibited clinical levels of PTSD based on the >33 PCL-5 threshold associated with a PTSD diagnosis, the levels actually reflected moderate posttraumatic stress symptoms. In addition, estimates of significantly reliable change in PCL-5 scores after an ayahuasca intervention (from 87.5% to 71.4%) were modified, and the threshold criteria for clinically significant changes (posttreatment scores <28) were removed because several participants met these criteria at baseline, thus impacting the interpretation of treatment outcomes. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2024-34611-001). OBJECTIVE: Although ayahuasca-a plant-based psychedelic-is discussed as promising in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), evidence so far remains limited to retrospective case reports and qualitative surveys. No study to date has examined whether ayahuasca results in prospective and clinically meaningful changes in trauma symptoms across individuals with PTSD symptoms. METHOD: To address this gap, we conducted a convergent mixed-methods case series study on eight military veterans with PTSD who participated in a 3-day ayahuasca intervention in Central America. Clinically meaningful changes from pre- to posttreatment and at a 3-month follow-up were assessed in three ways using: (a) PTSD checklist-5 (PCL-5); (b) experience sampling measurement of momentary PTSD and mood symptoms; and (c) an open-ended survey on perceived benefits. RESULTS: The majority (87.5%; 7/8) of participants demonstrated reliable and/or clinically significant changes in PCL-5 symptoms by posttreatment, which were maintained by 70% (5/7) of veterans by the 3-month follow-up. On average, veterans also reported significant improvements in momentary PTSD symptoms, as well as negative and positive affect in daily life posttreatment, with 63% (5/8) reporting moderate-to-large improvements in these domains. Broad themes characterizing the perceived benefits of ayahuasca included deep positive emotions, decentering/acceptance, and purpose in life; adverse acute experiences were, however, reported. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary support for the clinically meaningful and lasting benefits of a brief ayahuasca intervention on PTSD/mood symptoms in military veterans.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Ayahuasca, an entheogen from the Amazon rainforest, has garnered growing interest for treating substance dependence. To date, there is little research concerning the act of ayahuasca-related purging (mainly vomiting), which is considered to be central to healing during ayahuasca rituals. This study explored practitioner perspectives on purging during ayahuasca rituals at the Takiwasi Center in Peru. METHOD: We conducted in-depth interviews with curanderos (healers), plant preparers, and psychotherapists (N = 11) at the Takiwasi Center between August and October 2021. Interviews were conducted and transcribed in Spanish. Interviews were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Participants described purging as a fluid concept that went beyond the act of vomiting. Participant narratives around purging were organized into three central themes or accounts: spiritual-oriented, which highlighted the relationship between purging and spiritual development; Amazonian-oriented, which emphasized purging as a cathartic expulsion of embodied cargas (loads) that are perceived to lead to sickness; and clinical-oriented, which stressed that purging generates a range of empirically observable therapeutic benefits. All of these explanatory models emphasized the pivotal interconnection between purging and healing during ayahuasca-assisted treatment for substance dependence at Takiwasi. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights practitioner perspectives on purging at the Takiwasi Center, who offer three main explanatory models for this aspect of healing during ayahuasca-assisted therapy for substance dependence. This research contributes to the limited literature on the role of purging in ayahuasca-related healing, which may inform further investigation into differential understandings of the role of purging for therapeutic benefits.",

      "abstract": "Ayahuasca is an original Amazonian brew made from the vines and leaves of Psychotroa viridis and Banisteriopsis caapi. Both P. viridis and B. caapi give this brew its unique psychedelic properties which have been revered over centuries. In recent years, ayahuasca has gained attention as a potential therapeutic tool for mental health disorders, including substance abuse and depression. The uniqueness of ayahuasca's therapeutic potential is that it is an amalgamation of its biochemical makeup and the ritual guided by a shaman, along with the interpretation of the participant of their experience. The boom of \"ayahuasca tourism\" has brought forth testimonies of feeling \"cured\" of depression, and substance abuse and an improvement in overall well-being. This systematic literature review focuses on summarizing the recently available research on the effectiveness of ayahuasca as a treatment for depression, anxiety, substance abuse, eating disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. It also focuses on understanding the effects it has on personality traits that play a significant role in the manifestation of the above-listed mental health conditions effects. Additionally, the review investigates the importance and role the ritual itself plays, often described as the \"mystical experience\". This systematic literature review aims to explore the current state of knowledge regarding the use of ayahuasca for numerous mental health conditions by analyzing medical research papers published no earlier than September 2017 to no later than May 2023 from Google Scholar and PubMed. A total of 43 articles met the criteria and were used for detailed analysis. This review will synthesize the findings of the studies, examining the potential therapeutic effects of ayahuasca on multiple mental health disorders, the significance of the \"mystical experience,\" and the mechanisms of action underlying its effects. Through the review, ayahuasca proves to be a worthwhile therapeutic tool that if used in the right setting influences mind, body, and spirit. It is important to note that most studies used in this article relied on surveys and self-reporting proving to be a limitation as no clear standard has been achieved to test the efficacy of ayahuasca. The respect for the culture and origin needs to be retained as Western medicine dwells deeper into ayahuasca's benefits."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a naturally occurring serotonergic psychedelic found in natural plants around the globe. As the main psychoactive component in ayahuasca, which also contains monoamine oxidase inhibitors, DMT has been consumed as plant-based brew by indigenous peoples for centuries. Further research is required to delineate the therapeutic utility of DMT. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: Although previous research has shown that DMT is synthesized endogenously, it may not be produced at physiologically relevant concentrations. Additionally, the phenomenological similarities between the DMT-induced state and near-death experiences led to the popular hypothesis that endogenous DMT is released during the dying process. However, this hypothesis continues to be debated. Generally, DMT and ayahuasca seem to be physiologically and psychiatrically safe, although ayahuasca is known to cause transient vomiting. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: A double-blind, randomized controlled trial showed that, within 1 week, ayahuasca causes remission in 36% of patients with treatment-resistant depression. According to top-line results from a recent phase IIa trial, 57% of patients with major depressive disorder experienced remission 12 weeks after receiving a single intravenous dose of DMT. LIMITATIONS: There has only been a single published double-blind randomized controlled trial on ayahuasca and 2 on DMT. All clinical trials have had small sample sizes (≤34 participants). DMT requires further research to understand its therapeutic and clinical potential as a psychedelic. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence indicates that ayahuasca and DMT may be more effective than existing antidepressants for treating major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ayahuasca (AYA) is a botanical psychedelic with promising results in observational and small clinical trials for depression, trauma and drug use disorders. Its psychoactive effects primarily stem from N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). However, there is a lack of research on how and where AYA acts in the brain. This study addressed these questions by examining the extinction of aversive memories in AYA-treated rats. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We focused on the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, as DMT exhibits a high affinity for both of them, along with the infralimbic cortex in which activity and plasticity play crucial roles in regulating the mnemonic process under analysis. KEY RESULTS: A single oral treatment with AYA containing 0.3 mg·kg-1 of DMT increased the within-session extinction of contextual freezing behaviour without affecting its recall. This protocol, when repeated twice on consecutive days, enhanced extinction recall. These effects were consistent for both 1- and 21-day-old memories in males and females. AYA effects on fear extinction were independent of changes in anxiety and general exploratory activity: AYA- and vehicle-treated animals showed no differences when tested in the elevated plus-maze. The 5-HT2A receptor antagonist MDL-11,939 and the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 infused into the infralimbic cortex respectively blocked within- and between-session fear extinction effects resulting from repeated oral administration of AYA. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings highlight complementary mechanisms by which AYA facilitates the behavioural suppression of aversive memories in the rat infralimbic cortex. These results suggest potential beneficial effects of AYA or DMT in stress-related disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is growing scientific evidence for the therapeutic benefits of the Amazonian plant-based psychedelic \"ayahuasca\" for neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. However, there are certain challenges when incorporating botanical ayahuasca into biomedical research and clinical therapy environments. Formulations inspired by ayahuasca, which contain specific and standardized active components, are a potential remedy. METHODS: We investigated subjective acute and persisting effects of a novel formulation containing the reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor harmine (orodispersible tablet containing 100 mg MAO-I) and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (incremental intranasal dosing of up to 100 mg DMT), compared with two other conditions, namely harmine alone and placebo, in a crossover RCT in 31 healthy male subjects. RESULTS: DMT + harmine, but not harmine alone, induced a psychedelic experience assessed with the 5D-ASC rating scale [global score: F(2,60) = 80.21, p < 0.001] and acute experience sampling items over time, characterized by psychological insights [PIQ, F(2,58.5) = 28.514, p < 0.001], emotional breakthroughs [EBI, F(2,60) = 26.509, p < 0.001], and low scores on the challenging experience questionnaire [CEQ, F(2,60) = 12.84, p < 0.001]. Participants attributed personal and spiritual significance to the experience (GSR) with mainly positive persisting effects (PEQ) at 1- and 4-months follow-up. Acute drug effects correlated positively with persisting effects. We found no changes in trait measures of personality, psychological flexibility, or general well-being, and no increases in psychopathology (SCL-90-R) were reported. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the experience induced by the standardized DMT + harmine formulation induces a phenomenologically rich psychedelic experience, demonstrates good psychological safety and tolerability, is well tolerated, and induces beneficial psychological processes that could possibly support psychotherapy. Further studies are required to investigate the psychotherapeutic potential in patients."

      "abstract": "Recently, the Amazonian plant medicine \"ayahuasca\"-containing the psychedelic compound N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and numerous β-carboline alkaloids, such as harmine-has been suggested to exhibit beneficial effects in patients with affective and other mental health disorders. Although ayahuasca ingestion is considered safe, its pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and tolerability profile pose some challenges and may limit the clinical applicability in vulnerable patient populations. While overdosing and the admixture of intolerable plant constituents may explain some of the common adverse reactions, the peroral route of administration may represent another relevant source of gastro-intestinal intolerabilities and unpredictable pharmacokinetics across users. To overcome these challenges, the present work aimed at creating ayahuasca-analogue formulations with improved pharmacokinetics and tolerability profiles. To this end, we developed peroral formulas and compared them with parenteral formulas specifically designed to circumvent the gastro-intestinal tract. In more detail, peroral administration of a capsule (containing purified DMT and harmine) was tested against a combined administration of an oromucosal harmine tablet and an intranasal DMT spray at two dose levels in an open-label within-subject study in 10 healthy male subjects. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were assessed by means of continuous blood sampling, vital sign monitoring, and psychometric assessments. Common side effects induced by traditional herbal ayahuasca such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were significantly attenuated by our DMT/harmine formulations. While all preparations were well tolerated, the combined buccal/intranasal administration of harmine and DMT yielded substantially improved pharmacokinetic profiles, indicated by significantly reduced variations in systemic exposure. In conclusion, the combined buccal/intranasal administration of harmine and DMT is an innovative approach that may pave the way towards a safe, rapid-acting, and patient-oriented administration of DMT/harmine for the treatment of affective disorders.

In the original article, there was an error in the calculations that led to the overstatement of the symptom severity of the veteran sample. Specifically, sum scores for the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom checklist (PCL-5) were scored using a 1-5 Likert scale rather than the appropriate 0-4 Likert scale. As a result, although it was stated that participants in the veteran sample exhibited clinical levels of PTSD based on the >33 PCL-5 threshold associated with a PTSD diagnosis, the levels actually reflected moderate posttraumatic stress symptoms. In addition, estimates of significantly reliable change in PCL-5 scores after an ayahuasca intervention (from 87.5% to 71.4%) were modified, and the threshold criteria for clinically significant changes (posttreatment scores <28) were removed because several participants met these criteria at baseline, thus impacting the interpretation of treatment outcomes.] Objective: Although ayahuasca-a plant-based psychedelic-is discussed as promising in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), evidence so far remains limited to retrospective case reports and qualitative surveys. No study to date has examined whether ayahuasca results in prospective and clinically meaningful changes in trauma symptoms across individuals with PTSD symptoms. METHOD: To address this gap, we conducted a convergent mixed-methods case series study on eight military veterans with PTSD who participated in a 3-day ayahuasca intervention in Central America. Clinically meaningful changes from pre- to posttreatment and at a 3-month follow-up were assessed in three ways using: (a) PTSD checklist-5 (PCL-5); (b) experience sampling measurement of momentary PTSD and mood symptoms; and (c) an open-ended survey on perceived benefits. RESULTS: The majority (87.5%; 7/8) of participants demonstrated reliable and/or clinically significant changes in PCL-5 symptoms by posttreatment, which were maintained by 70% (5/7) of veterans by the 3-month follow-up. On average, veterans also reported significant improvements in momentary PTSD symptoms, as well as negative and positive affect in daily life posttreatment, with 63% (5/8) reporting moderate-to-large improvements in these domains. Broad themes characterizing the perceived benefits of ayahuasca included deep positive emotions, decentering/acceptance, and purpose in life; adverse acute experiences were, however, reported. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary support for the clinically meaningful and lasting benefits of a brief ayahuasca intervention on PTSD/mood symptoms in military veterans.

Although there is an emerging scientific literature on its effects, to the best of our knowledge no study has explored the self-reported experiences of first-time ayahuasca users with quantitative textual analysis tools. Accordingly, the current study aimed to analyze the subjective experience of naive individuals with depression and healthy controls after consuming ayahuasca. For this purpose, responses from a subsample of participants from a previous clinical trial to open-ended questions regarding their experience with ayahuasca underwent textual analysis. Data from nine patients with treatment-resistant depression and 20 healthy individuals were included, and quantitative textual analysis was performed using IRaMuTeQ 0.7 alpha 2 and R 3.1.2. The analysis identified five clusters: alterations in the state of consciousness, cognitive changes, somatic alterations, auditory experiences, and visual perceptual content. Additionally, findings suggest specific features of the experience of people with depression with ayahuasca, such as increased aversive bodily reactions. The results are consistent with previous findings indicating central axes of the psychedelic experience, and may inform therapeutic approaches using ayahuasca.",

Ayahuasca, a psychedelic plant medicine originating in Indigenous Amazonian communities, is being investigated. Aspects of ceremonial ayahuasca use (purging, dietary restrictions) appear similar to ED behaviors, raising questions about ayahuasca's suitability as an intervention for individuals with EDs. This study explored the perspectives of ayahuasca ceremony leaders on these and other considerations for ceremonial ayahuasca drinking among individuals with EDs. A qualitative content analysis of interviews was undertaken with 15 ayahuasca ceremony leaders, the majority of whom were from the West/Global North. Screening for EDs, purging and dietary restrictions, potential risks and dangers, and complementarity with conventional ED treatment emerged as categories. The findings offer ideas, including careful screening and extra support, to promote safe and beneficial ceremony experiences for ceremony participants with EDs. More research is needed to clarify the impacts of ceremony-related purging and preparatory diets. To evolve conventional models of treatment, the ED field could consider Indigenous approaches to mental health whereby ayahuasca ceremony leaders and ED researchers and clinicians collaborate in a decolonizing, bidirectional bridging process between Western and Indigenous paradigms of healing.",

The study involved the chemical analysis of ayahuasca samples, an ethnographic description of the two traditions and rituals, and the application of psychometric scales to measure personality differences, and the acute psychological effects during an ayahuasca ritual. Personality measurements showed lower scores for Santo Daime in Neuroticism-Anxiety, Dependence, Low Self-Esteem, Anger and Restlessness. These differences may be related to the presence of participants under treatment in the neo-shamanic group and/or to the protective effects of a church religion such as Santo Daime. Regarding acute effects, the neo-shamanic group showed higher scores in Somesthesia and Perception, which can be related to the high-arousal ritual setting. Chemical analysis for the ayahuasca samples showed a typical composition of alkaloids. No adulterants were found. The sample from the neo-shamanic group displayed a higher β-carbolines:DMT ratio compared to the Santo Daime sample, which could be related to the higher effects observed for Somesthesia for the neo-shamanic group. Significant positive correlations between some personality traits and acute effects were found only in the neo-shamanic group, which may be related to the more individualistic approach of this tradition.",

This pilot therapeutic program has been designed specifically for Indigenous individuals, incorporating the ceremonial use of naturally derived psychedelics in addressing substance use disorders and other mental health issues. The program employs a community-based approach, integrating various traditional Indigenous healing practices like the sweatlodge (temazcal), medicinal plant preparations, and the ritualistic use of selected psychedelics from natural sources (such as ayahuasca, peyote, and secretions from Incilius alvarius). These approaches are complemented by culturally attuned group and individual psychotherapy sessions, as well as group sports, community meals, collaborative construction efforts for a permanent clinical infrastructure, and cultural engagements such as art, crafts, and collective music. To evaluate the program's efficacy, safety, and cultural implications, an ongoing observational study is being conducted by an international team of researchers. The preliminary results demonstrate therapeutic progress and improved psychometric outcomes observed in the three case studies presented, indicating promise for this intercultural therapeutic intervention."

Bodily metaphors and visionary analogies frequently appear in narrative plots where they can express the reappraisal, overcoming, and sometimes emboldening of symptoms diagnosed by psychiatry. Moving beyond the literal-figurative divide, the article explores the intrinsic \"metaphoricity\" of psychedelic experiences and advocates for a literacy of conceptual metaphors regarding both clinical and non-clinical psychedelic narratives.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This article focuses on the outcomes at 1 year post-treatment of a naturalistic evaluation of services provided through the Takiwasi Centre, an accredited Peruvian therapeutic community offering an ayahuasca-assisted, integrative treatment program for addiction rehabilitation. METHOD: Participants (n = 52) completed structured interviews and a battery of validated instruments. Outcome measures included the Addiction Severity Index (Version 5), the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventories, the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Spiritual Religious and Personal Belief (WHOQOL-SRPB) scale. Likert rating scales were used to assess perceived importance and significance of different aspects of the program and overall participant satisfaction. RESULTS: The group change from baseline to the 1-year follow-up was significant and in the anticipated direction for alcohol and drug use severity, depression and anxiety, and some dimensions of quality of life. There was considerable individual variation in outcomes and treatment duration. The majority of participants rated all aspects of the program as important, including the spiritual and therapeutic significance of the ayahuasca experience, which was rated as very significant. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the positive 1-year outcomes, and within the limitations of an uncontrolled observational study design, the findings suggest promise for the effectiveness of the use of ayahuasca in a multifactorial treatment context for individuals with significant treatment histories, high levels of comorbidity, and treatment motivation. Results highlight considerable variation in individual experience that merit in-depth qualitative analysis. Implications for ayahuasca-assisted and other psychedelic-assisted treatment alternatives are discussed.",

Thus, 228 publications were identified, of which 66 were included in the present study. The reviewed studies suggest that ayahuasca may have beneficial effects on various physical and psychological conditions, namely in the treatment of depression, anxiety and various diseases of the neurobiological system, as well as anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, demonstrating its therapeutic potential. The number of studies that address this issue has also been growing, demonstrating interest in the search for alternative treatments.

      "abstract": "Changes in narcissistic traits (e.g., entitlement) following the ceremonial use of ayahuasca were examined across three timepoints (baseline, postretreat, 3-month follow-up) in a sample of 314 adults using self- and informant-report (N = 110) measures. Following ceremonial use of ayahuasca, self-reported changes in narcissism were observed (i.e., decreases in Narcissistic Personality Inventory [NPI] Entitlement-Exploitativeness, increases in NPI Leadership Authority, decreases in a proxy measure of narcissistic personality disorder [NPD]). However, effect size changes were small, results were somewhat mixed across convergent measures, and no significant changes were observed by informants. The present study provides modest and qualified support for adaptive change in narcissistic antagonism up to 3 months following ceremony experiences, suggesting some potential for treatment efficacy. However, meaningful changes in narcissism were not observed. More research would be needed to adequately evaluate the relevance of psychedelic-assisted therapy for narcissistic traits, particularly studies examining individuals with higher antagonism and involving antagonism-focused therapeutic approaches.",

      "abstract": "Ayahuasca is a psychoactive Amazonian plant brew. It is usually made from the Banisteriopsis caapi vine (Spruce ex Griseb. Morton, Malpighiaceae), which contains three primary harmala alkaloids, along with the leaves of Psychotria viridis (Ruiz et Pavon, Rubiaceae) in which the potent psychedelic dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is found. DMT-harmaloid concoctions have gained popularity in recent years, due to growing anecdotal and scientific reports of therapeutic benefits associated with their consumption. Ayahuasca is now ingested in a variety of different settings across the globe, from traditional ethnobotanical to so called \"neo-shamanic\" ceremonies. Furthermore, related preparations involving alternative sources of DMT and harmala alkaloids are becoming increasingly common as knowledge of ayahuasca continues to spread internationally. This article reviews the existing literature and draws on original qualitative data from a large cross-sectional study of ayahuasca drinkers, to propose a model of psychotherapeutic processes associated with the consumption of ayahuasca. We assert that it is these processes, facilitated by a range of neurobiological effects, that lead to beneficial mental health and wellbeing outcomes. Our proposed model identifies five key psychotherapeutic processes or effects inherent to the ayahuasca experience; somatic effects; introspection and emotional processing; increased Self-connection; increased spiritual connection, and finally the gaining of insights and new perspectives. We note some important differences in these processes compared with other classic psychedelics as well as the implications of the model for the therapeutic use of ayahuasca. Improved understanding of the psychotherapeutic processes involved with the ayahuasca experience will better equip practitioners to work with this potentially transformative concoction and enable the optimization of therapeutic treatment models for potential clinical use."

Hub metabolites represent nodes in the biochemical network playing a critical role in integrating the information flow in cells between metabolism and signaling pathways. Limited technical-scientific studies have been conducted to understand the effects of ayahuasca (Aya) administration in the metabolism considering MDD molecular context. Therefore, this work aims to investigate an in vitro primary astrocyte model by untargeted metabolomics of two cellular subfractions: secretome and intracellular content after pre-defined Aya treatments, based on DMT concentration. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics data revealed significant hub metabolites, which were used to predict biochemical pathway alterations. Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism, and vitamin B6 and B3 metabolism were associated to Aya treatment, as \"housekeeping\" pathways. Dopamine synthesis was overrepresented in the network results when considering the lowest tested DMT concentration (1 µmol L-1). Building reaction networks containing significant and differential metabolites, such as nicotinamide, L-DOPA, and L-leucine, is a useful approach to guide on dose decision and pathway selection in further analytical and molecular studies.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The understanding of biological responses to psychedelics with antidepressant potential is imperative. Here we report how a set of acute parameters, namely emotional (depressive symptoms), cognitive (psychedelic experience), and physiological (salivary cortisol), recorded during an ayahuasca dosing session, modulated serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), serum cortisol (SC), serum interleukin 6 (IL-6), plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), and salivary cortisol awakening response (CAR). METHODS: Results were analyzed 2 days after the psychedelic intervention (ayahuasca) versus placebo in both patients with treatment-resistant depression and healthy volunteers. These measures were assessed as part of a randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (n = 72). RESULTS: Results revealed that larger reductions of depressive symptoms during the dosing session significantly moderated higher levels of SC in patients. Whereas lesser changes in salivary cortisol levels during the ayahuasca intervention were related to higher BDNF levels in patients with a larger clinical response in the reduction in depressive symptoms. No moderator was found for patient's CAR, IL-6, and CRP responses to ayahuasca and for all biomarker responses to ayahuasca in healthy controls and in the placebo group. DISCUSSION: In summary, some specific emotional and physiological parameters during experimental ayahuasca session were revealed as critical moderators of the improvement of major depression biomarkers, mainly BDNF and SC two days after ayahuasca intake. These findings contribute to paving the way for future studies investigating the biological antidepressant response to psychedelic therapy."

      "abstract": "Ayahuasca is a blend of Amazonian plants that has been used for traditional medicine by the inhabitants of this region for hundreds of years. Furthermore, this plant has been demonstrated to be a viable therapy for a variety of neurological and mental diseases. EEG experiments have found specific brain regions that changed significantly due to ayahuasca. Here, we used an EEG dataset to investigate the ability to automatically detect changes in brain activity using machine learning and complex networks. Machine learning was applied at three different levels of data abstraction: (A) the raw EEG time series, (B) the correlation of the EEG time series, and (C) the complex network measures calculated from (B). Further, at the abstraction level of (C), we developed new measures of complex networks relating to community detection. As a result, the machine learning method was able to automatically detect changes in brain activity, with case (B) showing the highest accuracy (92%), followed by (A) (88%) and (C) (83%), indicating that connectivity changes between brain regions are more important for the detection of ayahuasca. The most activated areas were the frontal and temporal lobe, which is consistent with the literature. F3 and PO4 were the most important brain connections, a significant new discovery for psychedelic literature. This connection may point to a cognitive process akin to face recognition in individuals during ayahuasca-mediated visual hallucinations. Furthermore, closeness centrality and assortativity were the most important complex network measures. These two measures are also associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, indicating a possible therapeutic mechanism. Moreover, the new measures were crucial to the predictive model and suggested larger brain communities associated with the use of ayahuasca. This suggests that the dissemination of information in functional brain networks is slower when this drug is present. Overall, our methodology was able to automatically detect changes in brain activity during ayahuasca consumption and interpret how these psychedelics alter brain networks, as well as provide insights into their mechanisms of action.",

      "abstract": "Observational studies of long-term users of ayahuasca, an Amazonian psychedelic brew, suggest an increase in resilience via improvements in emotion and cognition. Ayahuasca has also demonstrated clinical antidepressant effects in human and animal studies; however, its potential prophylactic action in depression has not been previously studied. Therefore, this experimental study sought to evaluate the potential prophylactic effects of repeated and long-term ayahuasca use, via the modulation of resilience, in a non-human primate animal model, Callithrix jacchus, subjected to a protocol for induction of depressive-like behavior. For the formation of the study groups, some juvenile marmosets were kept in their family groups (GF = 7), while for the two experimental groups, the animals were removed from the family and kept socially isolated. Then, part of the isolated animals made up the group in which ayahuasca was administered (AG, n = 6), while for others, no intervention was made (IG, n = 5). AG animals took ayahuasca (1.67 mL/300g body weight) at weeks 4 (before isolation), 8, and 12 (during isolation) of the study. More adaptive stress response was observed for the AG when compared to the IG. The AG showed higher cortisol reactivity and fecal cortisol levels than IG, while both measures were similar to FG. Moreover, AG animals showed no signs of anhedonia and no increase in chronic stress-related behaviors, which were expressed by the IG. Thus, ayahuasca seems to promote the expression of resilient responses, indicating a prophylactic action, buffering the emergence of depressive-like behaviors and cortisol alterations associated with major depression. These results are encouraging for further research on the prophylactic use of psychedelics to prevent psychopathologies associated with chronic stress."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent research suggests that ayahuasca and its alkaloid-containing ingredients may be helpful in the treatment and prevention of certain movement and neurodegenerative disorders. However, such research is still in its infancy and more studies in normative samples seem necessary to explore effects of ayahuasca on clinically relevant brain structures, such as the corpus callosum. AIMS: The purpose of the present study was to investigate links between ayahuasca use and callosal structure in a normative sample. METHODS: Using structural imaging data from 22 ayahuasca users and 22 matched controls we compared the thickness of the corpus callosum between both groups at 100 equidistant points across the entire midsagittal surface. In addition, we investigated point-wise correlations between callosal thickness and the number of past ayahuasca sessions. RESULTS: The corpus callosum was significantly thicker within the isthmus in the ayahuasca group than in the control group. There was also a significant positive correlation between callosal thickness and the number of past ayahuasca sessions within the rostral body, albeit none of these effects survived corrections for multiple comparisons. No region was significantly thicker in the control than in the ayahuasca group, and no callosal region was negatively linked to ayahuasca use, even at uncorrected significance thresholds. CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence of links between ayahuasca use and the corpus callosum. However, future studies need to replicate these findings, preferably using larger sample sizes and ideally also utilizing longitudinal research designs, to draw any practical conclusion and offer implications for follow-up clinical research."

      "abstract": "Background: Naturalistic and placebo-controlled studies suggest ayahuasca, a potent psychedelic beverage originating from Indigenous Amazonian tradition, may improve mental health, alter personality structure, and reduce alcohol and drug intake. To better understand ayahuasca's therapeutic potential and to identify factors that influence therapeutic efficacy, we conducted a naturalistic, longitudinal study of facilitated ayahuasca consumption in naïve participants using a comprehensive battery of self-report questionnaires. Materials and Methods: Ayahuasca naive individuals registering for ayahuasca ceremonies were asked to complete a range of validated questionnaires assessing mental health, alcohol/cannabis use, relationships, personality, and connection to self and spirituality, prior to and 1 month after attending an ayahuasca ceremony. Data for two mental health measures (the DASS-21 and PANAS) and acute subjective effects via the MEQ-30 were also assessed 7 days post-ceremony. Repeated measures ANOVA were used to examine pre-to-post changes, and Pearson correlations explored predictors of improvement in outcomes. Results: Fifty-three attendees (32 women, 21 men) completed pre and post ayahuasca assessments with 55.6% of the sample reporting a complete mystical experience based on the MEQ-30. One-month post-ayahuasca, significant reductions were identified in depression, anxiety, stress, alcohol and cannabis use, body dissociation, accepting external influence, self-alienation, impulsivity, and negative affect/emotionality. Significant increases were identified in positive mood, self-efficacy, authentic living, extraversion, agreeableness, open-mindedness, spirituality, and satisfaction with relationships. While facets of the mystical experience held little predictive validity on outcome measures, baseline traits, particularly high negative emotionality and body dissociation, and low sense of self-efficacy, robustly predicted improvements in mental health and alcohol/cannabis use, and alterations in personality structure which are linked to better mental health. Discussion: This study suggests facilitated ayahuasca consumption in naïve participants may precipitate wide-ranging improvements in mental health, relationships, personality structure, and alcohol use. Associations between baseline traits and therapeutic improvements mark an important first step toward personalized, precision-based medicine and warrant randomized controlled trials to confirm and elaborate on these findings. Contribution Statement: Longitudinal, observational studies and randomized clinical control trials suggest ayahuasca may exert therapeutic effects on mental health and alcohol/cannabis use, and alter personality structure. However, it is unclear if improvements are diagnosis-specific and factors that predict therapeutic gains have yet to be extensively elucidated. This longitudinal, observational study examined the effects of facilitated ayahuasca consumption in naive participants on mental health, alcohol and substance use/abuse, personality traits, relationships, and connection to self and spirituality. We found wide-ranging improvements 1-month post-treatment across these domains, and identified baseline traits which predict pre-to-post changes on primary outcome measures. Improvements were not diagnostic-specific, suggesting ayahuasca may be generally efficacious. Personality traits, body dissociation, and self-efficacy were strong predictors of therapeutic improvements, marking an important first step toward personalized, precision-based medicine. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm and elaborate on these findings."

Ayahuasca, a psychedelic plant medicine from the Amazon, is currently being investigated. This study expands on prior exploratory research by describing the perspectives of ayahuasca ceremony leaders regarding their conceptualizations of EDs and the potential therapeutic mechanisms of action of ayahuasca for individuals with EDs. Qualitative content analysis of interviews with 15 ayahuasca ceremony leaders produced two main categories, with relevant subcategories. The first category encompassed the leaders' theories of EDs from a shamanic perspective, including that EDs are symptomatic of an underlying concern, serve a function and affect health in multiple domains. The second category described leaders' perspectives on the potential mechanisms of action of ayahuasca for EDs, including that ayahuasca facilitates \"energetic healing\"; helps identify, process, and integrate the \"root\" of the ED; promotes holistic healing; and enhances and/or reorganizes relationships. From the perspectives of ceremony leaders and consistent with previous exploratory research, ceremonial ayahuasca use may offer a potentially useful, novel and complementary intervention for EDs."

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: To uncover whether psychedelic drugs attenuate fear memory responses would advance the development of better psychedelic-based treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Ayahuasca (AYA), a psychedelic brew containing indolamine N, N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and β-carbolines, facilitates fear extinction and improves neural plasticity. Upon retrieval, fear memory undergoes labilization and reconsolidation; however, the effects of AYA on this memory stabilization phase are unknown. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the effects of AYA treatment on fear memory reconsolidation. METHODS: Fear-conditioned Wistar rats received AYA (60, 120, or 240 mg/kg) or H2O orally via gavage o.g. 20 min before, immediately, or 3 h after a short retrieval session. Analysis of AYA through liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine the content of DMT and β-carbolines in AYA. RESULTS: AYA impaired fear memory reconsolidation when given 20 min before or 3 h after memory retrieval, with the dose of 60 mg/kg being effective at both moments. This dose of AYA was devoid of anxiolytic effect. Importantly, during retrieval, AYA did not change fear expression. The lack of retrieval abolished the reconsolidation impairing effect of AYA. The effects of AYA treatment 20 min before or 3 h after memory retrieval lasted at least 22 days, suggesting no spontaneous recovery of fear memory. Fear memory impairments induced by AYA treatment, at both moments, do not show reinstatement. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the view that a low dose of AYA treatment impairs early and late stages of memory reconsolidation instead of facilitating fear extinction.",

As for the depressive-like behavior, there was a decrease in the group induced to the disease model, both in the prevention subgroup (when compared to the SAL/SAL, SAL/AYA, and LPS/AYA with LPS/SAL groups) and in the treatment (when comparing SAL/SAL and LPS/AYA with LPS/SAL). This study concludes the anxiolytic and antidepressant potential of ayahuasca in an animal model of neuroinflammation, possibly due to the antineuroinflammatory effects already reported of the compound.",

      "abstract": "Ischemic eye diseases are major causes of vision impairment. Thus, potential retinoprotective effects of N'N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) were investigated. To inhibit its rapid breakdown by monoamine-oxidase A (MAO-A) enzyme, DMT was co-administered with harmaline, a β-carboline in the Amazonian Ayahuasca brew. Using ligation, 60 min of ischemia was provoked in eyes of rats, followed by 7 days of reperfusion whilst animals received harmaline alone, DMT + harmaline, or vehicle treatment. After 1 week of reperfusion, electroretinographical (ERG) measurements, histological analysis, and Western blot were performed. Harmaline alone exhibited retinoprotection in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) which was, surprisingly, counterbalanced by DMT in case of co-administration. As both MAO-A inhibition and DMT increase serotoninergic tone synergistically, communicated to be anti-ischemic, thus, involvement of other pathways was investigated. Based on our experiments, DMT and harmaline exert opposite effects on important ocular proteins such as PARP1, NFκB, MMP9, or HSP70, each having a critical role in a different mechanism of eye-ischemia-related pathologies, e.g., cell death, inflammation, tissue destruction, and oxidative stress. Since DMT is proclaimed to be a promising drug candidate, its potentially undesirable effect on eye-ischemia should be further investigated. Meanwhile, this experiment revealed the potential therapeutic effect of MAO-A inhibitor harmaline in I/R-related eye diseases."

When comparing the psychological traits of ayahuasca participants to a control group, quantitative results using the Zuckerman-Kuhlman-Aluja Personality Questionnaire showed statistically significant higher scores in Impulsive Sensation Seeking, Boredom Susceptibility, and Social Warmth scales. Qualitative analysis of ayahuasca experiences resulted in five main categories: emotional experiences (including social emotions such as love and empathy), corporal experiences, spiritual/transcendental experiences, personal experiences, and visions. Last, qualitative descriptions provide support for the importance of social interactions in the phenomenological manifestations of the psychedelic experience. Both quantitative and qualitative results suggest that the combination of social interactions and the pharmacological action of ayahuasca could facilitate the manifestation of social emotions during the ritual, and may contribute to the long-term increase of empathic and social aspects of personality.",

This study aimed to isolate new bioactive compounds from B. caapi extract and evaluate their biological activity, and that of the known β-carboline components of the plant (harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine), in BV-2 microglial cells, the in vivo activation of which is implicated in the physiopathology of CNS disorders. B. caapi extract was fractionated using semipreparative liquid chromatography (HPLC-DAD) and the exact masses ([M + H]+m/z) of the compounds in the 5 isolated fractions were determined by high-resolution LC-MS/MS: F1 (174.0918 and 233.1289), F2 (353.1722), F3 (304.3001), F4 (188.1081), and F5 (205.0785). Harmine (75.5-302 µM) significantly decreased cell viability after 2 h of treatment and increased the number of necrotic cells and production of reactive oxygen species at equal or lower concentrations after 24 h. F4 did not impact viability but was also cytotoxic after 24 h. Most treatments reduced proinflammatory cytokine production (IL-2, IL-6, IL-17, and/or TNF), especially harmaline and F5 at 2.5 µM and higher concentrations, tetrahydroharmine (9.3 µM and higher), and F5 (10.7 µM and higher).

      "abstract": "There has been a renewed interest in the potential use of psychedelics for the treatment of psychiatric conditions. Nevertheless, little is known about the mechanism of action and molecular pathways influenced by ayahuasca use in humans. Therefore, for the first time, our study aims to investigate the human metabolomics signature after consumption of a psychedelic, ayahuasca, and its connection with both the psychedelic-induced subjective effects and the plasma concentrations of ayahuasca alkaloids. Plasma samples of 23 individuals were collected both before and after ayahuasca consumption. Samples were analysed through targeted metabolomics and further integrated with subjective ratings of the ayahuasca experience (i.e., using the 5-Dimension Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale [ASC]), and plasma ayahuasca-alkaloids using integrated network analysis. Metabolic pathways enrichment analysis using diffusion algorithms for specific KEGG modules was performed on the metabolic output. Compared to baseline, the consumption of ayahuasca increased N-acyl-ethanolamine endocannabinoids, decreased 2-acyl-glycerol endocannabinoids, and altered several large-neutral amino acids (LNAAs). Integrated network results indicated that most of the LNAAs were inversely associated with 9 out of the 11 subscales of the ASC, except for tryptophan which was positively associated. Several endocannabinoids and hexosylceramides were directly associated with the ayahuasca alkaloids. Enrichment analysis confirmed dysregulation in several pathways involved in neurotransmission such as serotonin and dopamine synthesis. In conclusion, a crosstalk between the circulating LNAAs and the subjective effects is suggested, which is independent of the alkaloid concentrations and provides insights into the specific metabolic fingerprint and mechanism of action underlying ayahuasca experiences.",

Pre-clinical and observational studies have demonstrated its possible potential as an antidepressant, and open- and placebo-controlled clinical trials corroborated these results. For it to become an approved treatment for depression, its safety and tolerability need to be assessed and documented. AREAS COVERED: We have gathered data regarding the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) in all reported randomized, placebo-controlled trials with healthy and clinical populations involving ayahuasca administration (n = 108 ayahuasca administrations). We systematically categorized these results, recorded their prevalence, and discussed the possible mechanisms related to their emergence. EXPERT OPINION: There were no reports of serious AEs, indicating a relative safety of ayahuasca administration in controlled settings. Most common AEs included nausea, vomiting, headaches, and transient increases in cardiovascular measurements. Ayahuasca research is still in its infancy, especially concerning the absence of large and robust clinical trials to verify its antidepressant effects. Dose standardization, legal prohibition of the possession of its alkaloids and how traditional communities will be compensated if ayahuasca becomes an approved medicine are the biggest obstacles to overcome for its future use in the therapeutic context.",

AIMS: While preliminary evidence suggests that psychological flexibility and emotion regulation processes play an important role within psychedelic therapy, this prospective study addressed methodological gaps in the literature and examined the ability of ayahuasca to stimulate acute states of cognitive reappraisal and long-term changes in psychological flexibility and mood. The study also explored whether moderating factors predisposed participants to experience therapeutic changes. METHODS: Participants (N = 261) were recruited from three Shipibo ayahuasca retreat centers in Central and South America and completed assessments on mood, psychological flexibility, and acute ceremonial factors. Expectancy, demand characteristics, and invalid responding were controlled for with several validity scales. RESULTS/OUTCOMES: Participants reported significant reductions in negative mood after three months, as well as increases in positive mood and psychological flexibility. Acute experiences of reappraisal during the ayahuasca ceremony exerted the strongest moderating effects on increases in positive mood and psychological flexibility. Increases in psychological flexibility statistically mediated the effects of acute psychological factors, including reappraisal, on changes in positive mood. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results highlight the role of acute psychological processes, such as reappraisal, and post-acute increases in psychological flexibility as putative mechanisms underlying positive outcomes associated with psychedelics. These results also provide support for the integration of third-wave and mindfulness-based therapy approaches with psychedelic-assisted interventions.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Ayahuasca has been proposed as a potential treatment of alcohol (ethanol) use disorder (AUD). The serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is the main psychoactive component of ayahuasca, suggesting that its therapeutic effects may be mediated by 5-HT2A receptors. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of ayahuasca on the expression of ethanol self-administration using a two-bottle choice procedure and the role of 5-HT2A receptors in those effects. METHODS: Male mice had intermittent access to ethanol (10% v/v) in a two-bottle choice procedure for 30 days. Animals were then submitted to 3 treatment phases, each followed by ethanol re-exposure tests. During the treatment phase, every 3 days, animals received i.p. injections of either vehicle or the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist M100907 (M100, 1 mg/kg) followed by an i.g. (gavage) administration of vehicle or ayahuasca (100 mg/kg) and were exposed to the self-administration apparatus with no ethanol availability. During re-exposure tests, animals were submitted to the same conditions as during acquisition, with no treatments prior to those sessions. RESULTS: Treatment with ayahuasca blocked the expression of ethanol self-administration, decreasing ethanol intake and preference during re-exposure tests. Pretreatment with M100 blocked the effects of ayahuasca on ethanol drinking without significantly attenuating ethanol self-administration. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with ayahuasca during alcohol abstinence blocked the expression of alcohol self-administration in mice, and 5-HT2A receptor activation is critical for those effects to emerge. Our findings support a potential for ayahuasca and other 5-HT2A receptor agonists as adjunctive pharmacotherapies for the treatment of AUD.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Smoking-related disease is a major problem globally. Effective smoking cessation treatments are however limited. Increasing evidence suggests that psychedelics have potential as treatments for substance use disorders and may therefore prove an option in aiding smoking cessation. OBJECTIVES: To establish which factors predict smoking cessation in people who reported quitting or reducing smoking following ayahuasca consumption. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional mixed-method study (quantitative and qualitative design) was undertaken using data from an online survey evaluating peoples' experiences before and after drinking ayahuasca. Multivariate logistic regression was performed with smoking condition (cessation or reduction/relapse) as a dependent variable and demographics, smoking, ayahuasca-related variables and the mystical experience (MEQ30) as predicting factors. RESULTS: A total of 441 responses were grouped according to self-reported smoking status: cessation (n = 305) or reduction/relapse (n = 136) smoking. Logistic regression showed that mystical experience (OR: 1.03; 95% CI [1.00-1.05]) and frequency of ayahuasca intake (OR: 2.16[1.00-4.70]) were protective factors, while positive mood (measured by the MEQ30) during the ayahuasca experience was a risk factor (OR: 0.91[0.85-0.97]). Qualitative thematic analysis identified eight themes (e.g. acquired awareness, spiritual experience, increased motivation) related to the ayahuasca experience and the process of smoking cessation/reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ayahuasca could be used as a potential tool for smoking cessation, and that effects may be mediated by mystical experience. Given the current burden of smoking-related disease and the limited treatment options, studies are needed to investigate the efficacy of psychedelics in smoking cessation.",

The article assesses potential ayahuasca and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) integration with contemporary healthcare. The review also seeks to provide a summary of selected literature regarding the mechanisms of action of DMT and ayahuasca; and assess to what extent the state of research can explain reports of unusual phenomenology. DESIGN: A narrative review. RESULTS: Compounds in ayahuasca have been found to bind to serotonergic receptors, glutaminergic receptors, sigma-1 receptors, trace amine-associated receptors, and modulate BDNF expression and the dopaminergic system. Subjective effects are associated with increased delta and theta oscillations in amygdala and hippocampal regions, decreased alpha wave activity in the default mode network, and stimulations of vision-related brain regions particularly in the visual association cortex. Both biological processes and field of consciousness models have been proposed to explain subjective effects of DMT and ayahuasca, however, the evidence supporting the proposed models is not sufficient to make confident conclusions. Ayahuasca plant medicine and DMT represent potentially novel treatment modalities. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is required to clarify the mechanisms of action and develop treatments which can be made available to the general public. Integration between healthcare research institutions and reputable practitioners in the Amazon is recommended.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ayahuasca, a psychoactive beverage prepared from Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis, is originally used by Amazon-based indigenous and mestizo groups for medicinal and ritualistic purposes. Nowadays, ayahuasca is used in religious and shamanic contexts worldwide, and preliminary evidence from preclinical and observational studies suggests therapeutic effects of ayahuasca for the treatment of substance (including alcohol) use disorders. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the initial pharmacological profile of ayahuasca and its effects on ethanol rewarding effect using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ayahuasca beverage was prepared using extracts of B. caapi and P. viridis, and the concentration of active compounds was assessed through high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The following behavioral tests were performed after ayahuasca administration: general pharmacological screening (13, 130, or 1300 mg/kg - intraperitoneally - i.p., and 65, 130, 1300, or 2600 mg/kg - via oral - v.o.); acute toxicity test with elevated doses (2600 mg/kg - i.p., and 5000 mg/kg - v.o.); motor activity, motor coordination, and hexobarbital-induced sleeping time potentiation (250, 500, or 750 mg/kg ayahuasca or vehicle - v.o.). For the CPP test, the animals received ayahuasca (500 mg/kg - v.o.) prior to ethanol (1.8 g/kg - i.p.) or vehicle (control group - i.p.) during conditioning sessions. RESULTS: Ayahuasca treatment presented no significant effect on motor activity, motor coordination, hexobarbital-induced sleeping latency or total sleeping time, and did not evoke signs of severe acute toxicity at elevated oral doses. Ayahuasca pre-treatment successfully inhibited the ethanol-induced CPP and induced CPP when administered alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that ayahuasca presents a low-risk acute toxicological profile when administered orally, and presents potential pharmacological properties that could contribute to the treatment of alcohol use disorders.",

      "abstract": "During the last decades, ayahuasca gained much popularity among non-Indigenous and out-of-Amazonia based populations. In popular culture, it has been advertised as a natural remedy that was discovered by Indigenous peoples ante millennia and that has been used for shamanic healing of all kinds of ailments. This \"neo-shamanic,\" and often recreational, use of ayahuasca, however, has to be distinguished from traditional Indigenous praxes on the one hand, and, on the other hand, from medical investigation in the modern world. The former, Indigenous use mainly understands ayahuasca as an amplifying power for interacting with non-human beings in the animal, plant, or spirit realms. Within this paradigm, efficacy is not dependent on the drug, but on the correct communication between the healer (or sorcerer) and the non-human powers that are considered real and powerful also without resorting to ayahuasca. The latter, modern mode of understanding, contrastingly treats the neurochemical processes of MAO inhibition and dimethyltryptamine activity as trigger mechanisms for a series of psychological as well as somatic responses, including positive outcomes in the treatment of various mental conditions. I argue that there is an ontological incommensurability occurring especially between the Indigenous and medicinal concepts of ayahuasca use (with recreational use in its widest understanding trying to make sense from both sides). Modern medical applications of ayahuasca are so fundamentally different from Indigenous concepts that the latter cannot be used to legitimate or confirm the former (and vice versa). Finally, the deep coloniality in the process of appropriation of the Indigenous by the modern has to be questioned and resolved in any case of ayahuasca application."

Mixed with water and boiled for hours or days, it produces a brownish-colored liquid with a strong and characteristic taste. Ayahuasca contains the psychedelic tryptamine N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOi), and in the past few years, it has been tested. In recent years its antidepressant properties have been put to the test. Evidence from open and randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials has shown encouraging results, indicating significant and rapid antidepressant effects, starting as early as 1 day after the ayahuasca intervention. In addition, we have explored the nature of these effects using multivariate measures. In this article, we will review the history, pharmacology, clinical trials, and clinical and behavioral markers associated with the antidepressant effects of ayahuasca.",

      "abstract": "Background: Naturalistic and placebo-controlled studies have suggested that ayahuasca, a traditional Amazonian beverage, could be helpful in the treatment of psychopathologies like depression and anxiety disorders by changing otherwise disturbed cognitive and emotional processes. To better understand its full therapeutic potential, one way is to study the effects on processes like flexible thinking, empathy, and well-being, which are normally compromised in stress-related psychopathologies. Materials and Methods: Volunteers attending ayahuasca ceremonies were asked to complete a test battery at three separate occasions: baseline, the morning after, and 1 week after the ceremony. We included the constructs of creative thinking (measured by Picture Concept Test), empathy (Multifaceted Empathy Test), satisfaction with life (Satisfaction with Life Scale), decentering (Experiences Questionnaire), and personality (Big Five Inventory) into the test battery. Additionally, the psychedelic experience was quantified with the Persisting Effects Questionnaire, the Ego Dissolution Scale, and Visual Analogue Scales. Results: In total, 43 attendees (males = 22; females = 21) completed parts of the baseline assessment, 20 (males = 12; females = 8) completed assessments in the morning after the ceremony, and 19 (males = 14; females = 5) completed assessments at the 1-week follow-up. At one and 7 days post-ceremony, cognitive empathy, satisfaction with life, and decentering increased, while divergent thinking (Fluency corrected for Originality) decreased, when compared to baseline. Implicit emotional empathy increased at 1-week follow-up, whereas ratings of the trait neuroticism decreased. Conclusion: The study suggests that a single ingestion of ayahuasca in a social setting is associated with enhancement of subjective well-being, an enhanced ability to take an objective and non-judging stance towards the self (decentering), and the ability to correctly recognize emotions in others, compared to baseline, lasting up to 1 week post-ceremony. To understand the therapeutic potential related to these effects, further research with clinical populations is needed in which these effects can be assessed, including its link with therapeutic outcomes. Together, this will increase our understanding of the effectiveness and breadth of future therapeutic options."

However, results are inconsistent, and the effects of ayahuasca on personality were never investigated in a controlled trial. Objectives: To assess the effects of ayahuasca on personality in two randomized, placebo-controlled trials in healthy volunteers. Methods: Data from two parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in healthy volunteers were included. In the first trial, 15 volunteers ingested ayahuasca or placebo, while in the second trial 15 volunteers received placebo+ayahuasca or cannabidiol (CBD)+ayahuasca. Personality was assessed with the NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) at baseline and 21 days post-treatment. Results: There were significant differences between groups in baseline Openness scores, but not on day 21. A significant increase in Openness scores was observed in the placebo + ayahuasca group in study 2. No other within-group differences were observed for any other domain. Conclusions: Ayahuasca produced inconsistent effects on personality since it induced significant increase in Openness 21 days post-drug intake only in one of the trials. The absence of significant differences in the other ayahuasca groups could be due to small sample sizes and baseline differences among groups. The effects of ayahuasca and other serotonergic hallucinogens on personality should be further investigated in clinical samples."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Ayahuasca is a psychedelic brew that originated in the Amazon basin. The psychological effects of this drug are becoming better understood due to the growing research interest in identifying new potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of emotion dysregulation and other disorders. Previous studies suggest that ayahuasca enhances mindfulness-related capacities (decentering, non-judging, non-reacting and acceptance) and emotion regulation. The aim of the present exploratory study was to determine the effects of ayahuasca on self-compassion in a community sample. METHODS: We administered validated questionnaires (the Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form and Forms of Self-Criticism and Self-Reassurance) to evaluate pre-post changes in self-compassion and self-criticism/self-reassurance in 45 volunteers (27 women; 60%) before and after (≤24 h) an ayahuasca ceremony. Most participants (n = 29; 67.4%) had previously used ayahuasca. RESULTS: Ayahuasca resulted in significant improvements, with medium to large effect sizes (η2  = 0.184-0.276), in measures of self-compassion (p < 0.05), self-criticism (p < 0.01) and self-reassurance (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that ayahuasca promotes well-being and self-compassion, which could have a therapeutic effect on individuals with negative affect and other psychopathological conditions. Large, controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

This study investigates associations between ayahuasca consumption in naturalistic settings and current alcohol and other drug use. METHODS: Online cross-sectional study of people who have consumed ayahuasca in religious, traditional and non-traditional settings in over 40 countries. A total of 8629 participants (53% male, average age 40 years) were included in the analysis. Logistic regressions were used to explore associations between ayahuasca drinking variables and the current use of alcohol and other drugs, as well as the influence of confounding factors, such as church or community membership. RESULTS: The number of times ayahuasca had been consumed was strongly associated with increased odds of never or rarely drinking alcohol, never or rarely engaging in 'risky drinking' and having not consumed a range of drugs in the past month, with these effects greater for those with a prior substance use disorder compared to those without. The strength of ayahuasca drinkers subjective spiritual experience, number of personal self-insights obtained and drinking ayahuasca with an ayahuasca church were also associated with lower substance use in some models. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of ayahuasca in naturalistic settings is associated with lower self-reported current consumption of alcohol and other drugs for those with and without prior substance use disorders, with such effects present after adjusting for religious or social group effects.",

The goal of the project is to assess treatment outcomes and understand the therapeutic mechanisms of an Ayahuasca-assisted, integrative treatment model for addiction rehabilitation in the Peruvian Amazon. The proposed intervention protocol highlights the significance of treatment setting in the design, delivery, and efficacy of an addiction rehabilitation program that involves the potent psychedelic tea known as Ayahuasca. After describing the context of the study, we put forth details about our mixed-methods approach to data collection and analysis, with which we seek to gain an understanding of why, how, and for whom this specific ayahuasca-assisted treatment program is effective across a range of outcomes. The ATOP protocol employs qualitative research methods as a means to determine which aspects of the setting are meaningful to clients and practitioners, and how this may correlate with outcome measures. This paper delineates the core principles, methods, and measures of the overall ATOP umbrella, then discusses the role of ATOP in the context of the literature on long-term residential programs. To conclude, we discuss the strengths and limitations of the protocol and the intended future of the project."

Potential risks involved with usage of this hallucinogenic drug include psychotic episodes related to N,N-dimethyltryptamine and serotonin syndrome, which can be potentially life threatening. The consequences of ayahuasca use remain uncertain because of poor quality control, unpredictability, and polydrug interactions. Nurses, advanced practice nurses, and other healthcare providers working in outpatient settings, hospitals, and treatment centers need to be familiar with the pharmacology, possible drug interactions, and management for ayahuasca ingestion for optimal decision making.

      "abstract": "Ayahuasca is a traditional plant decoction containing N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and various β-carbolines including harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine, which has been used ceremonially by Amazonian Indigenous groups for healing and spiritual purposes. Use of the brew has now spread far beyond its original context of consumption to North America, Europe, and Australia in neo-shamanic settings as well as Christian syncretic churches. While these groups have established their own rituals and protocols to guide use, it remains unknown the extent to which the use of traditional or non-traditional practices may affect drinkers' acute experiences, and longer term wellbeing and mental health outcomes. Hence, this study aimed to provide the first detailed assessment of associations between ceremony/ritual characteristics, additional support practices, motivations for drinking, and mental health and wellbeing outcomes. The paper uses data from a large cross-sectional study of ayahuasca drinkers in more than 40 countries who had used ayahuasca in various contexts (n = 6,877). It captured detailed information about participant demographics, patterns and history of ayahuasca drinking, the setting of consumption, and ritualistic practices employed. Current mental health status was captured via the Kessler 10 psychological distress scale and the mental health component score of the SF-12 Health Questionnaire, while reported change in prior clinically diagnosed anxiety or depression (n = 1276) was evaluated using a (PGIC) Patient Global Impression of Change tool. Various intermediate outcomes were also assessed including perceived change in psychological wellbeing, number of personal self-insights attained, and subjective spiritual experience measured via the spirituality dimension of the Persisting Effects Questionnaire (PEQ) and Short Index of Mystical Orientation. Regression models identified a range of significant associations between set and setting variables, and intermediate and final mental health and wellbeing outcomes. A generalized structural equation model (GSEM) was then used to verify relationships and associations between endogenous, mediating and final outcome variables concurrently. The present study sheds new light on the influence of ceremonial practices, additional supports and motivations on the therapeutic effects of ayahuasca for mental health and wellbeing, and ways in which such factors can be optimized in naturalistic settings and clinical studies."

A previous systematic review of preclinical and human studies published until 2016 suggested that ayahuasca and its alkaloids have therapeutic effects in the treatment of SUDs. To conduct an update of this previous review. A systematic review of quantitative studies which analyzed the effects of ayahuasca and its alkaloids on drug use (primary outcome) and other measures (secondary outcomes) related to SUDs was conducted, including articles from 2016 to 2020. Nine studies (four preclinical, five observational) were included in the review. Preclinical studies in rodents reported reductions in amphetamine self-administration and anxiety, and in alcohol- and methylphenidate-induced conditioned place preference. Observational studies among healthy ritual ayahuasca users and patients with SUDs reported reductions in drug use, anxiety, and depression, and increases in quality of life and well-being. We replicated the findings of the previous review suggesting that ayahuasca and its alkaloids have therapeutic effects in the treatment of SUDs. However, translation of preclinical data to humans is limited, observational studies do not allow us to infer causality, and there is a lack of standardization on ayahuasca doses. Although promising, randomized, controlled trials are needed to better elucidate these results. The PROSPERO ID for this study is CRD42020192046.",

Previous research in naturalistic settings has suggested that ingestion of ayahuasca can improve mental health and well-being; however, these studies were not placebo controlled and did not control for the possibility of expectation bias. This naturalistic observational study was designed to assess whether mental health changes were produced by ayahuasca or by set and setting. Assessments were made pre- and post-ayahuasca sessions in 30 experienced participants of ayahuasca retreats hosted in the Netherlands, Spain, and Germany. Participants consumed ayahuasca (N = 14) or placebo (N = 16). Analysis revealed a main effect of time on symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Compared to baseline, symptoms reduced in both groups after the ceremony, independent of treatment. There was a main treatment × time interaction on implicit emotional empathy, indicating that ayahuasca increased emotional empathy to negative stimuli. The current findings suggest that improvements in mental health of participants of ayahuasca ceremonies can be driven by non-pharmacological factors that constitute a placebo response but also by pharmacological factors that are related to the use of ayahuasca. These findings stress the importance of placebo-controlled designs in psychedelic research and the need to further explore the contribution of non-pharmacological factors to the psychedelic experience.",

Here we report the case of a patient who had a psychotic episode after taking ayahuasca and who was successfully treated with antipsychotic medication. Given the current spread of ayahuasca consumption in developed societies, the present case highlights the need for better understanding and regulation of the social-legal condition of ayahuasca and the need for further research. Additionally, psycho-education seems advisable in order to create awareness of the potential risks of the use of ayahuasca."

Studies with psychedelics demonstrate therapeutic effects for anxiety and depression associated with life-threatening illnesses. Ayahuasca has been proposed as a possible therapeutic agent in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Preliminary studies suggest that ayahuasca could promote therapeutic effects for people with physical illnesses. The aim of this study was to explore how the ritual use of ayahuasca during the treatment of severe physical illnesses (SPI) may influence the way people understand and relate to their illness, using qualitative methods to assess the participants' perspectives. Participants who consumed ayahuasca ritualistically during the period of treatment for SPI were purposely chosen. Data were obtained through semi-structured interviews. A thematic analysis was performed with 14 individuals. The ritual experience with ayahuasca acted on the participants' illness understanding through multiple psychological mechanisms, including introspection, self-analysis, emotional processing and catharsis, recall of autobiographical memories subjectively related to illness origin, illness resignification, and perspective changes. This study suggests that the experience with ayahuasca may facilitate illness acceptance through an influence on the meanings of the illness, life, and death. These changes may favor a more balanced relationship with illness and treatment.",

Preliminary evidence indicates that treatment with the psychedelic ayahuasca may lead to decreases in depressive symptoms among individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, there remains limited understanding of whether ayahuasca also leads to reductions in suicidality. OBJECTIVE: To examine the acute and post-acute effect of ayahuasca on suicidality among individuals with MDD. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of an open-label trial in which individuals with recurrent MDD received a single dose of ayahuasca (N = 17). Suicidality was assessed at baseline; during the intervention; and 1, 7, 14, and 21 days after the intervention. RESULTS: Among individuals with suicidality at baseline (n = 15), there were significant acute (i.e., 40, 80, 140, and 180 min after administration) and post-acute (1, 7, 14, and 21 days after administration) decreases in suicidality following administration of ayahuasca. Post-acute effect sizes for decreases in suicidality were large (Hedges' g = 1.31-1.75), with the largest effect size 21 days after the intervention (g = 1.75). CONCLUSIONS: When administered in the appropriate context, ayahuasca may lead to rapid and sustained reductions in suicidality among individuals with MDD. Randomized, double-blind studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm this early finding.",

      "abstract": "Ayahuasca is a hallucinogenic botanical beverage originally used by indigenous Amazonian tribes in religious ceremonies and therapeutic practices. While ethnobotanical surveys still indicate its spiritual and medicinal uses, consumption of ayahuasca has been progressively related with a recreational purpose, particularly in Western societies. The ayahuasca aqueous concoction is typically prepared from the leaves of the N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT)-containing Psychotria viridis, and the stem and bark of Banisteriopsis caapi, the plant source of harmala alkaloids. Herein, the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of the psychoactive DMT and harmala alkaloids harmine, harmaline and tetrahydroharmine, are comprehensively covered, particularly emphasizing the psychological, physiological, and toxic effects deriving from their concomitant intake. Potential therapeutic utility, particularly in mental and psychiatric disorders, and forensic aspects of DMT and ayahuasca are also reviewed and discussed. Following administration of ayahuasca, DMT is rapidly absorbed and distributed. Harmala alkaloids act as potent inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), preventing extensive first-pass degradation of DMT into 3-indole-acetic acid (3-IAA), and enabling sufficient amounts of DMT to reach the brain. DMT has affinity for a variety of serotonergic and non-serotonergic receptors, though its psychotropic effects are mainly related with the activation of serotonin receptors type 2A (5-HT2A). Mildly to rarely severe psychedelic adverse effects are reported for ayahuasca or its alkaloids individually, but abuse does not lead to dependence or tolerance. For a long time, the evidence has pointed to potential psychotherapeutic benefits in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders; and although misuse of ayahuasca has been diverting attention away from such clinical potential, research onto its therapeutic effects has now strongly resurged."

Our results demonstrate that DMT administration activates the main adult neurogenic niche, the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, promoting newly generated neurons in the granular zone. Moreover, these mice performed better, compared to control non-treated animals, in memory tests, which suggest a functional relevance for the DMT-induced new production of neurons in the hippocampus. Interestingly, the neurogenic effect of DMT appears to involve signaling via sigma-1 receptor (S1R) activation since S1R antagonist blocked the neurogenic effect. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DMT treatment activates the subgranular neurogenic niche regulating the proliferation of neural stem cells, the migration of neuroblasts, and promoting the generation of new neurons in the hippocampus, therefore enhancing adult neurogenesis and improving spatial learning and memory tasks.",

Its biological activity results from the content of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), acting mainly as a non-selective agonist of serotonin receptors and beta-carboline alkaloids, which are strong and short-acting monoamine oxidase type A(MAOI-A) inhibitors. For many years there have been reports of both the anti-anxiety and antidepressant effects of ayahuasca, as well as indications of the possibility of its use in the treatment of addictions. The results of studies of its effectiveness in drug-resistant depression seem to be promising, comparable in the opinion of some authors with the effect of therapeutic action of ketamine. In the article, we try to explain the complex profile of action and the resulting potential benefits, but also the risk of interaction and adverse effects associated with the taking of ayahuasca, which is important given the high variability of herbal mixtures used to produce the decoction.",

Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, motivation, quality of life, spirituality, and treatment satisfaction were also measured and analyzed by means of two tailed t-test, one way ANOVA and Spearman test. From pre- to post-treatment, patients showed significant reductions in scores of anxiety (from 20.8 to 11.6, p < .002) and depression (from 18.7 to 7.5, p <.001). Similarly, patients showed higher scores of quality of life (p < .001) and spirituality (p < .001) upon discharge, which correlated with their reduction in scores of anxiety and depression. While future results will evaluate the efficacy of this treatment on measures of addiction at follow-up, the present results build upon previous research to bring further support to the use of Ayahuasca and Amazonian medicine in mental health treatments with a transpersonal focus.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Accumulating evidence suggests that ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic beverage used in traditional Amazonian communities for ritualistic and curative purposes, has been associated with reduced rates of substance use disorders. However, the brain mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of ayahuasca have not yet been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of treatment with ayahuasca on the rewarding properties of the psychostimulant methylphenidate. METHODS: The rewarding properties of ayahuasca (100 mg/kg, orally) and methylphenidate (10 mg/kg, i.p.) were investigated using the conditioned place preference (CPP) model. Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of repeated treatment with ayahuasca on the reinstatement of methylphenidate-induced CPP. Fos expression was evaluated in different limbic structures (cingulate cortex-area 1, prelimbic cortex, infralimbic cortex, orbitofrontal cortex-lateral orbital area, nucleus accumbens core and shell, ventral tegmental area, dorsal striatum, and basolateral amygdala) upon each experimental phase. RESULTS: Both ayahuasca and methylphenidate induced CPP in mice. However, ayahuasca had limited effects on Fos expression, while methylphenidate altered Fos expression in several brain regions associated with the behavioral effects of drugs of abuse. Treatment with ayahuasca after conditioning with methylphenidate blocked the reinstatement of methylphenidate-induced CPP. Those behavioral effects were accompanied by changes in Fos expression patterns, with ayahuasca generally blocking the changes in Fos expression induced by conditioning with methylphenidate and/or reexposure to methylphenidate. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that ayahuasca restored normal brain function in areas associated with the long-term expression of drug wanting/seeking in animals conditioned to methylphenidate.",

We conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of ayahuasca with treatment-resistant depression patients (n = 28) and healthy controls (n = 45). AIMS: We are evaluating the blood inflammatory biomarkers: C-reactive protein and interleukin 6, as a potential consequence of ayahuasca intake and their correlation with serum cortisol and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. Blood samples were collected at pre-treatment and 48 hours after substance ingestion to assess the concentration of inflammatory biomarkers, together with administration of the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. RESULTS: At pre-treatment, patients showed higher C-reactive protein levels than healthy controls and a significant negative correlation between C-reactive protein and serum cortisol levels was revealed (rho = -0.40, n = 14). C-reactive protein in those patients was not correlated with Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores. We observed a significant reduction of C-reactive protein levels across time in both patients and controls treated with ayahuasca, but not with placebo. Patients treated with ayahuasca showed a significant correlation (rho = + 0.57) between larger reductions of C-reactive protein and lower depressive symptoms at 48 hours after substance ingestion (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale). No significant result with respect to interleukin 6 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor was found. Furthermore, these biomarkers did not predict the antidepressant response or remission rates observed. CONCLUSIONS: These findings enhance the understanding of the biological mechanisms behind the observed antidepressant effects of ayahuasca and encourage further clinical trials in adults with depression.",

In the context of psychedelic research, quantification of the tea's main alkaloids prior to its administration in animal or human studies is essential. For this reason, this study aims to provide information regarding the stability of the main ayahuasca alkaloids (dimethyltryptamine, DMT; harmine, HRM; tetrahydroharmine, THH; harmaline, HRL) in three different conditions: (1) A year stored in a refrigerator either in plastic or glass containers, (2) seven days at 37 °C to reproduce usual mail transportation, and (3) after three freeze-thaw cycles. Samples were quantified after a dilute-and-shoot procedure using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). There was no significant degradation of DMT concentration over time in all tested conditions. Harmala alkaloids (THH, HRL, and HRM) showed important variations after long-term and high-temperature storages. Although DMT has proven to be stable in all studied conditions, the harmala alkaloids revealed intense degradation and even concentration increment. This may be caused by degradation, alkaloid inter-conversion, and leaching from tea precipitate material. Therefore, ayahuasca quantification before administration in controlled sets is mandatory.",

One of its common applications is for the treatment of addiction. The current study is an assessment of the impact of ayahuasca on personality traits in former substance users from Catalonia and surrounding areas. When compared with a control group, the ayahuasca group had statistically significantly higher scores in the dimensions Novelty Seeking and Self-Transcendence, and in the traits Attachment, Impulsivity, Compassion, and Spiritual Acceptance. Results suggest that recovery could be related less to a reduction of Impulsivity and Novelty Seeking, main features of substance use disorder (SUD), and more to an increase of Character dimensions and traits, especially Self-Transcendence and Cooperativeness. Those changes could be triggered by self-reflective, prosocial, and transcendental ayahuasca ritual experiences, which in the qualitative part of the research were described by the participants as being of great importance for their recovery, helping with the reconstruction of personal goals, gratifications, social bonds, and the general life's projection.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Ayahuasca is a hallucinogenic plant preparation, traditionally consumed in sacred ceremonies by indigenous North-Westerner Amazonian countries like Colombia, Peru, Brazil, and Ecuador. It is fundamental to carefully balance benefits/risks related to the ayahuasca intake, both during ceremonies and experimental settings. The aim is at evaluating and comparing the potential therapeutic benefits versus health risks related to ayahuasca intake (both acutely and chronically), focusing on its application in psychedelic psychiatry. DESIGN: A comprehensive mini overview focusing on psychiatric outcomes following ayahuasca intake both in healthy volunteers and in clinical samples. RESULTS: Preclinical, observational, and experimental studies in healthy volunteers as well as in clinical samples suggest that ayahuasca may be beneficial as an antidepressant, emotional regulator, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive drug, by exerting fast-acting and enduring clinical effects. Ayahuasca appears to be safe and well tolerated, nausea and emesis being the most reported and transient side effects. Some findings suggest not to use ayahuasca in bipolar or psychotic patients because of an increased risk of manic switch and/or psychotic onset. CONCLUSIONS: Further research should be carried out in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, by implementing neuroimaging studies, in order to better evaluate therapeutic potential of ayahuasca in mental disorders.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY RELEVANCE: Ayahuasca is a tea produced through decoction of Amazonian plants. It has been used for centuries by indigenous people of South America. The beverage is considered to be an ethnomedicine, and it is traditionally used for the treatment of a wide range of diseases, including neurological illness. Besides, some scientific evidence suggests it may be applicable to Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment. Thus, Ayahuasca deserves in depth studies to clarify its potential role in this disease. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to use an untargeted metabolomics approach to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of the Ayahuasca beverage, the extracts from its matrix plants (Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis), its fractions and its main alkaloids on the viability of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in an in vitro PD model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The cytotoxicity of Ayahuasca, crude extracts, and fractions of B. caapi and P. viridis, as well as neuroprotection promoted by these samples in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neurodegeneration model, were evaluated by the MTT assay at two time-points: 48 h (T1) and 72 h (T2). The main alkaloids from Ayahuasca matrix plants, harmine (HRE) and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), were also isolated and evaluated. An untargeted metabolomics approach was developed to explore the chemical composition of samples with neuroprotective activity. Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to Electrospray Ionisation and Time-of-Flight (UPLC-ESI-TOF) metabolome data was treated and further analysed using multivariate statistical analyses (MSA): principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The metabolites were dereplicated using the Dictionary of Natural Products and an in house database. The main alkaloids were also quantified by UPLC-MS/MS. RESULTS: The samples did not cause cytotoxicity in vitro and three of samples intensely increased cell viability at T1. The crude extracts, alkaloid fractions and HRE demonstrated remarkable neuroprotective effect at T2 while the hydroalcoholic fractions demonstrated this neuroprotective effect at T1 and T2. Several compounds from different classes, such as β-carbolines and monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) were revealed correlated with this property by MSA. Additionally, a total of 2419 compounds were detected in both ionisation modes. HRE showed potent neuroprotective action at 72 h, but it was not among the metabolites positively correlated with the most efficacious neuroprotective profile at either time (T1 and T2). Furthermore, DMT was statistically important to differentiate the dataset (VIP value > 1), although it did not exhibit sufficient neuroprotective activity by in vitro assay, neither a positive correlation with T1 and T2 neuroprotective profile, which corroborated the MSA results. CONCLUSION: The lower doses of the active samples stimulated neuronal cell proliferation and/or displayed the most efficacious neuroprotection profile, namely by preventing neuronal damage and improving cell viability against 6-OHDA-induced toxicity. Intriguingly, the hydroalcoholic fractions exhibited enhanced neuroprotective effects when compared to other samples and isolated alkaloids. This finding corroborates the significance of a holistic approach. The results demonstrate that Ayahuasca and its base plants have potential applicability for PD treatment and to prevent its progression differently from current drugs to treat PD.",

      "abstract": "Ayahuasca is a hallucinogenic beverage that affects the serotonergic system and have therapeutic potential for many diseases and disorders, including depression and drug addiction. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the potential toxic effects of ayahuasca on rats after chronic exposure, and the levels of monoamines, their metabolites and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain. Female and male rats were treated orally for 28 days with H2O (control), fluoxetine (FLX), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant, or ayahuasca (Aya) at doses of 0.5X, 1X and 2X the ritualistic dose (7 to 10 animals/group). Clinical, hematological and macroscopic results showed that ayahuasca was safe to the rats. Behavior tests conducted one hour after the last treatment showed that male rats from the Aya1 group explored the open field central area less than the control group, and the number of entries in the central area compared to total locomotion was also significantly lower in this group and in the FLX group. The hippocampus was removed for BDNF analysis and the remaining brain was used for monoamine analysis by HPLC-FL. Serotonin levels were significantly higher than control only in the Aya2 female group, while a significant reduction of its metabolite 5-HIAA was observed in the FLX group. Dopamine levels were similar among the experimental groups, but the levels of its metabolite DOPAC increased significantly in the Aya1 and Aya2 groups compared to controls, especially in females, and the DOPAC/dopamine turnover was significantly higher in Aya2 group. The levels of HVA, another dopamine metabolite, did not change with the treatments compared to controls, but HVA/DOPAC ratio was significantly lower in all ayahuasca male groups. Norepinephrine was not detected in any brain sample, and the levels of its metabolite MHPG did not change significantly among the groups. BDNF levels in the hippocampus were significantly higher in the FLX and Aya2 female groups compared to controls when expressed in relation to the total brain weight. The mechanisms involved in the increase in serotonin, dopamine turnover and BDNF levels observed in ayahuasca treated animals should be further investigated in specific brain areas.",

OBJECTIVES: Here, we examine the course of grief over 1 year of follow-up in a bereaved sample that attended a center in Peru to participate in indigenous Shipibo ayahuasca ceremonies. We also explore the roles of experiential avoidance and decentering as mechanisms of change. METHODS: Bereaved participants who attended the ayahuasca center responded to an online survey that included the Texas Revised Inventory of Grief, Symptom Assessment-45, WHO Quality of Life-Bref, Acceptance and Action Questionnaire, and Decentering. Baseline assessment was completed by 50 individuals (T0). Of these, 39 completed the post-assessment at 15 days (T1), 31 at 3 months (T2), 29 at 6 months (T3), and 27 at 12 months (T4) after leaving the retreat. Pearson's analysis was performed to examine the relationship between the severity of grief and mechanisms of change during the period of T0 and T1. RESULTS: A significant decrease in Texas Revised Inventory was observed at all time points (T1: Cohen's d = 0.84; T2: Cohen's d = 1.38; T3: Cohen's d = 1.16; T4: Cohen's d = 1.39). We found a relationship between experiential avoidance (r = 0.55; p < .01), decentering (r = - 0.47; p < .01), and a reduction in the severity of grief. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the ceremonial use of ayahuasca has therapeutic value by reducing the severity of grief. Acceptance and decentering are both psychological processes that mediate the improvement of grief symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Suicide is a major public health problem. Given increasing suicide rates and limitations surrounding current interventions, there is an urgent need for innovative interventions for suicidality. Although ayahuasca has been shown to target mental health concerns associated with suicidality (i.e., depression and hopelessness), research has not yet explored the impact of ayahuasca on suicidality. Therefore, we conducted secondary analyses of a randomized placebo-controlled trial in which individuals with treatment-resistant depression were administered one dose of ayahuasca (n = 14) or placebo (n = 15). Suicidality was assessed by a trained psychiatrist at baseline, as well as 1 day, 2 days, and 7 days after the intervention. A fixed-effects linear mixed model, as well as between and within-groups Cohen's d effect sizes were used to examine changes in suicidality. Controlling for baseline suicidality, we found a significant effect for time (p < .05). The effect of the intervention (i.e., ayahuasca vs. placebo) trended toward significance (p = .088). At all time points, we found medium between-group effect sizes (i.e., ayahuasca vs. placebo; day 1 Cohen's d = 0.58; day 2 d = 0.56; day 7 d = 0.67), as well as large within-group (ayahuasca; day 1 Cohen's d = 1.33; day 2 d = 1.42; day 7 d = 1.19) effect sizes, for decreases in suicidality. Conclusions: This research is the first to explore the impact of ayahuasca on suicidality. The findings suggest that ayahuasca may show potential as an intervention for suicidality. We highlight important limitations of the study, potential mechanisms, and future directions for research on ayahuasca as an intervention for suicidality.

In this study, Wistar rats had intermittent access to ethanol for 8 weeks, receiving water (control), naltrexone (NTX, 2 mg/kg body weight [bw] intraperitoneally [i.p.]) or ayahuasca (Aya) at 0.5x, 1x, or 2x the ritual dose in the final 5 days. A naïve group had access only to water. Ethanol intake was estimated throughout the experiment, and cFos expression was evaluated in medial orbital cortex (MO), ventral orbital cortex (VO), lateral orbital cortex (LO), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and striatum. Treatment with either NTX or Aya (oral) did not decrease ethanol intake compared to the baseline level (5th to 7th week), but the NTX group intake was significantly lower than controls (p < 0.05). Ethanol significantly increased cFos expression in the MO region for control (p < 0.0001), NTX (p < 0.05), Aya1 (p < 0.001), and Aya2 (p < 0.0001) groups. This increase was also observed in the VO for the Aya1 group (p = 0.035), in the LO for the Aya2 group (p < 0.01), and in NAc for NTX and ayahuasca groups (p < 0.005). Furthermore, NTX and Aya0.5 treatment decreased cFos expression compared to controls in the MO region (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively), but only the ayahuasca group reached levels not significantly different from the naïve group. Studies using other protocols and dose regime are necessary to better investigate the impact of ayahuasca on alcohol intake by rats to support the observations in humans. Additionally, the role of ayahuasca in mediating cFos expression in other selected brain regions and its relationship with the serotoninergic/dopaminergic systems and drug addiction need further investigation.",

This paper aims to qualitatively explore the impact of ayahuasca-assisted therapy on addiction and other substance use-related outcomes and elucidate the lived experiences of participants. DESIGN AND METHODS: Qualitative interviews were conducted with 11 adult Indigenous participants of the ayahuasca-assisted 'Working with Addiction and Stress' ceremonial retreats (June-September 2011). Semi-structured interviews assessed experiences of participants following the retreats at 6-month follow up. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts was conducted. RESULTS: Narratives revealed that the retreats helped participants identify negative thought patterns and barriers related to their addiction in ways that differed from conventional therapies. All participants reported reductions in substance use and cravings; eight participants reported complete cessation of at least one substance at follow up. Increased connectedness with self, others and nature/spirit was described as a key element associated with reduced substance use and cravings. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This analysis expands upon prior quantitative results highlighting the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca-assisted therapy and provides important contextual insights into why ayahuasca-assisted therapy may have been beneficial for members of an Indigenous community seeking to address their problematic use of substances. Given limited efficacy of conventional treatments for resolving addiction issues, further research should investigate the role of ayahuasca and other psychedelic-assisted therapies in enhancing connectedness and other key factors that may improve well-being and reduce harmful substance use.",

      "abstract": "Serotonergic psychedelics are emerging as potential antidepressant therapeutic tools, as suggested in a recent randomized controlled trial with ayahuasca for treatment-resistant depression. Preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels increase after treatment with serotoninergic antidepressants, but the exact role of BDNF as a biomarker for diagnostic and treatment of major depression is still poorly understood. Here we investigated serum BDNF levels in healthy controls (N = 45) and patients with treatment-resistant depression (N = 28) before (baseline) and 48 h after (D2) a single dose of ayahuasca or placebo. In our sample, baseline serum BDNF levels did not predict major depression and the clinical characteristics of the patients did not predict their BDNF levels. However, at baseline, serum cortisol was a predictor of serum BDNF levels, where lower levels of serum BDNF were detected in a subgroup of subjects with hypocortisolemia. Moreover, at baseline we found a negative correlation between BDNF and serum cortisol in volunteers with eucortisolemia. After treatment (D2) we observed higher BDNF levels in both patients and controls that ingested ayahuasca (N = 35) when compared to placebo (N = 34). Furthermore, at D2 just patients treated with ayahuasca (N = 14), and not with placebo (N = 14), presented a significant negative correlation between serum BDNF levels and depressive symptoms. This is the first double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial that explored the modulation of BDNF in response to a psychedelic in patients with depression. The results suggest a potential link between the observed antidepressant effects of ayahuasca and changes in serum BDNF, which contributes to the emerging view of using psychedelics as an antidepressant. This trial is registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02914769)."

This article reports on exploratory qualitative research relating to participant experiences with ceremonial ayahuasca drinking and conventional treatment for eating disorders (EDs). It also explores the potential for ayahuasca as an adjunctive ED treatment. METHODS: Thirteen individuals previously diagnosed with an ED participated in a semi-structured interview contrasting their experiences with conventional ED treatment with experiences from ceremonial ayahuasca. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participant reports were organized with key themes including that ayahuasca: led to rapid reductions in ED thoughts and symptoms; allowed for the healing of the perceived root of the ED; helped to process painful feelings and memories; supported the internalization of greater self-love and self-acceptance; and catalyzed spiritual elements of healing. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that ayahuasca may have potential as a valuable therapeutic tool, and further research-including carefully controlled clinical trials-is warranted.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The incidence rate of major depression in adolescents reaches approximately 14%. This disorder is usually recurrent, without remission of symptoms even after pharmacological treatment, and persists throughout adult life. Since the effects of antidepressants take approximately 2 weeks to begin, new pharmacological therapies are under continuous exploration. Recent evidence suggests that psychedelics could produce rapid antidepressant effects. In this study, we evaluated the potential antidepressant effects of ayahuasca in a juvenile non-human primate model of depression. METHODS: While living with their families, juvenile marmosets (8 males; 7 females) were observed on alternate days for four weeks during a baseline phase. This was followed by 8 weeks of an induced depressive state protocol, the social isolated context (IC), in which the animals were monitored in the first and last weeks. Subsequently, five males and four females were randomly selected for treatment, first with a single administration of saline vehicle (1.67 mL/300 g of body weight, via gavage), followed by a single dose of ayahuasca (1.67 mL/300 g of body weight, via gavage). Both phases lasted 1 week and the animals were monitored daily. A third week of sampling was called the tardive-pharmacological effects phase. In all phases the marmosets were assessed for behavior, fecal cortisol levels, and body weight. RESULTS: After IC, the animals presented typical hypocortisolemia, but cortisol recovered to baseline levels 24 h after an acute dose of ayahuasca; this recovery was not observed in vehicle-treated animals. Additionally, in males, ayahuasca, but not the vehicle, reduced scratching, a stereotypic behavior, and increased feeding. Ayahuasca treatment also improved body weight to baseline levels in both sexes. The ayahuasca-induced behavioral response had long-term effects (14 days). Thus, in this translational juvenile animal model of depression, ayahuasca presented beneficial effects. CONCLUSIONS: These results can contribute to the validation of ayahuasca as an antidepressant drug and encourage new studies on psychedelic drugs as a tool for treating mood disorders, including for adolescents with early-onset depression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Research suggests that mindfulness-based interventions may improve mindfulness-related capacities (e.g., decentering, non-judging, and non-reacting) and emotion regulation. Previously, our group reported that ayahuasca could be a potential analogue of mindfulness practice. The main aim of the current study was to examine the effects of ayahuasca on emotional regulation and mindfulness-related capacities. Secondarily, we sought to explore the effects of ayahuasca on individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) traits. METHOD: This is an observational study of 45 volunteers who participated in an ayahuasca session. The volunteers completed various self-report instruments designed to measure emotional dysregulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)) and mindfulness traits (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)-Short Form and Experiences Questionnaire (EQ)) prior to and 24 h after the ayahuasca session. The volunteers were divided into two subgroups based on their score on the McLean Screening Instrument for BPD (MSI-BPD). Twelve participants were grouped into the BPD-like traits subgroup while the rest of them were included in the non-BPD-like subgroup. We performed within-subjects and between-group analyses. RESULTS: Overall, the participants showed significant improvements on the FFMQ subscales observing, acting with awareness, non-judging, and non-reacting and also significantly improved on decentering (EQ scale) and on the DERS subscales emotional non-acceptance, emotional interference, and lack of control. The BPD-like subgroup also showed significant improvements on the DERS subscales emotional interference and lack of control but not in mindfulness capacities. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a potential therapeutic effect for ayahuasca in emotion regulation and mindfulness capacities (including decentering, acceptance, awareness, and sensitivity to meditation practice). Based on these results, we believe that ayahuasca therapy could be of value in clinical populations, such as individuals with BPD, affected by emotion dysregulation.",

      "abstract": "In recent decades, the growing interest of Westerners in the psychotropic brew ayahuasca and the participation in exotic rituals has led to the multiplication of \"shamanic centers\" in the Peruvian Amazon. Among these, Takiwasi is a therapeutic community that welcomes hundreds of national and foreign clients every year. This institution, created by a French physician in 1992, was originally intended to propose a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of addiction, characterized by the use of tools of Peruvian mestizo shamanism, biomedicine and clinical psychology. The diachronic evolution of the institution is however marked by the growing use of elements of the Catholic tradition. In this article, I will examine the hypothesis that these transformations can be interpreted as the effects of the globalization of the use of ayahuasca and its legal and political consequences. Thus, the case of Takiwasi underlines the role played by religious traditions and the medical field in the construction, legitimization and maintenance of new and hybrid practices that are multiplying around the use of ayahuasca.",

      "abstract": "Ayahuasca is a psychoactive brew traditionally used in shamanistic and vegetalistic rituals and has recently received lot of attention due to potential cognitive benefits. Ayahuasca effects are caused by the synergistic interaction of β-carbolines (harmine, harmaline and tetrahydroarmine) contained in Banisteriopsis caapi stalks combined with the N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) from Psychotria viridis leaves, a potent agonist to serotonin (5-HT) receptors. The present study approaches the effects of chronic and acute exposure to two Ayahuasca concentrations (0.1 and 0.5 ml/L) on the cognitive ability to discriminate objects in a one-trial learning task in zebrafish. Based on the combination of concentrations and exposure regimens, we divided adult zebrafish in five treatment groups: acute 0.1 and 0.5 ml/L, chronic 0.1 and 0.5 ml/L, and control 0.0 (n = 20 for each group). Then we tested them in a memory task of object discrimination. Acute Ayahuasca exposed groups performed similarly to the control group, however chronically treated fish (13 days) presented both impaired discriminative performance and locomotor alterations. Overall, these results indicate that Ayahuasca is a potent psychoactive drug that, in chronic exposure, negatively affects mnemonic parameters in zebrafish. In single exposure it does not affects cognitive performance, but the higher concentration (0.5) affected locomotion. Moreover, we reinforce the importance of the zebrafish for behavioral pharmacological studies of drug screening, in special to psychedelic drug research."

Following an online survey, the fieldwork among users of ayahuasca was carried out from November 2015 to December 2016. The research sample consisted of 46 persons (23 women and 23 men), who took part at least once in some type of ayahuasca ritual and/or were the facilitators of the ayahuasca sessions. We held semi-structured interviews with participants in order to discover the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca. Transcribed recordings were analyzed using the Grounded Theory Method. The results suggest that the intensity of effects produced by ayahuasca is not directly proportional to its therapeutic effect. According to the informants, ayahuasca is applicable in the treatment of drug addiction. They consider it to have a broad spectrum of therapeutic potential. This therapeutic potential could be based on memory recall.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Ayahuasca is a psychotropic plant tea from South America used for religious purposes by indigenous people of the Amazon. Increasing evidence indicates that ayahuasca may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of mental health disorders and can enhance mindfulness-related capacities. Most research so far has focused on acute and sub-acute effects of ayahuasca on mental health-related parameters and less on long-term effects. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to assess sub-acute and long-term effects of ayahuasca on well-being and cognitive thinking style. The second objective was to assess whether sub-acute and long-term effects of ayahuasca depend on the degree of ego dissolution that was experienced after consumption of ayahuasca. RESULTS: Ayahuasca ceremony attendants (N = 57) in the Netherlands and Colombia were assessed before, the day after, and 4 weeks following the ritual. Relative to baseline, ratings of depression and stress significantly decreased after the ayahuasca ceremony and these changes persisted for 4 weeks. Likewise, convergent thinking improved post-ayahuasca ceremony up until the 4 weeks follow-up. Satisfaction with life and several aspects of mindfulness increased the day after the ceremony, but these changes failed to reach significance 4 weeks after. Changes in affect, satisfaction with life, and mindfulness were significantly correlated to the level of ego dissolution experienced during the ayahuasca ceremony and were unrelated to previous experience with ayahuasca. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that ayahuasca produces sub-acute and long-term improvements in affect and cognitive thinking style in non-pathological users. These data highlight the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca in the treatment of mental health disorders, such as depression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent open-label trials show that psychedelics, such as ayahuasca, hold promise as fast-onset antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: To test the antidepressant effects of ayahuasca, we conducted a parallel-arm, double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in 29 patients with treatment-resistant depression. Patients received a single dose of either ayahuasca or placebo. We assessed changes in depression severity with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Hamilton Depression Rating scale at baseline, and at 1 (D1), 2 (D2), and 7 (D7) days after dosing. RESULTS: We observed significant antidepressant effects of ayahuasca when compared with placebo at all-time points. MADRS scores were significantly lower in the ayahuasca group compared with placebo at D1 and D2 (p = 0.04), and at D7 (p &lt; 0.0001). Between-group effect sizes increased from D1 to D7 (D1: Cohen's d = 0.84; D2: Cohen's d = 0.84; D7: Cohen's d = 1.49). Response rates were high for both groups at D1 and D2, and significantly higher in the ayahuasca group at D7 (64% v. 27%; p = 0.04). Remission rate showed a trend toward significance at D7 (36% v. 7%, p = 0.054). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first controlled trial to test a psychedelic substance in treatment-resistant depression. Overall, this study brings new evidence supporting the safety and therapeutic value of ayahuasca, dosed within an appropriate setting, to help treat depression.

      "abstract": "Ayahuasca is a hallucinogenic beverage produced from the decoction of Banisteriopsis caapi (Bc) and Psychotria viridis (Pv), β-carboline- and N,N-dimethyltryptamine(DMT)-containing plants, respectively. Accumulating evidence suggests that ayahuasca may have therapeutic effects on ethanol abuse. It is not known, however, whether its effects are dependent on the presence of DMT or if non-DMT-containing components would have therapeutic effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the rewarding properties of ayahuasca (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg, orally), Bc (132, 440, and 1320 mg/kg, orally) and Pv (3.75, 12.5 and 37.5 mg/kg, i.p.) extracts and their effects on ethanol (1.8 g/kg, i.p.) reward using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in male mice. Animals were conditioned with ayahuasca, Bc or Pv extracts during 8 sessions. An intermediate, but not a high, dose of ayahuasca induced CPP in mice. Bc and Pv did not induce CPP. Subsequently, the effects of those extracts were tested on the development of ethanol-induced CPP. Ayahuasca, Bc or Pv were administered before ethanol injections during conditioning sessions. While Bc and Pv exerted no effects on ethanol-induced CPP, pretreatment with ayahuasca blocked the development of CPP to ethanol. Finally, the effects of a post-ethanol-conditioning treatment with ayahuasca, Bc or Pv on the expression of ethanol-induced CPP were tested. Animals were conditioned with ethanol, and subsequently treated with either ayahuasca, Bc or Pv in the CPP environment previously associated with saline or ethanol for 6 days. Animals were then reexposed to ethanol and ethanol-induced CPP was quantified on the following day. Treatment with all compounds in the ethanol-paired environment blocked the expression of ethanol-induced CPP. Administration of an intermediate, but not a high, dose of ayahuasca and Bc, as well as Pv administration, in the saline-paired compartment blocked the expression of ethanol-induced CPP. The present study sheds light into the components underlying the therapeutic effects of ayahuasca on ethanol abuse, indicating that ayahuasca and its plant components can decrease ethanol reward at doses that do not exert abuse liability. Importantly, the treatment environment seems to influence the therapeutic effects of ayahuasca and Bc, providing important insights into clinical practice."

      "abstract": "Major depression is a highly prevalent mood disorder, affecting about 350 million people, and around 30% of the patients are resistant to currently available antidepressant medications. Recent evidence from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) supports the rapid antidepressant effects of the psychedelic ayahuasca in treatment-resistant depression. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of ayahuasca on plasma cortisol and awakening salivary cortisol response, in the same group of treatment-resistant patients (MD) and in healthy volunteers (C). Subjects received a single dose of ayahuasca or placebo (dosing session), and both plasma and awakening salivary cortisol response were measured at baseline (before dosing session) and 48 h after the dosing session. Baseline assessment (D0) showed blunted awakening salivary cortisol response and hypocortisolemia in patients, with respect to healthy controls. Salivary cortisol was also measured during dosing session, and we observed higher increases for both C and MD that ingested ayahuasca than placebo. After 48 h from the dosing session with ayahuasca, patients' awakening salivary cortisol response is similar to the ones detected in controls. No significant changes in plasma cortisol levels were observed 48 h after the sessions. Therefore, these findings point to new evidence on the modulation of salivary cortisol levels as a result of an ayahuasca session, both in healthy and depressive volunteers. Considering that cortisol acts in regulation of distinct physiological pathways, emotional and cognitive processes, it is assumed to be critically involved to the etiology of depression and its regulation seems to be important for the treatment and remission of major depression, ayahuasca use as antidepressant should be further investigated. Moreover, this study highlights the importance of psychedelics in the treatment of human mental disorders."

      "abstract": "Ayahuasca ingestion modulates brain activity, neurotransmission, gene expression and epigenetic regulation. N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT, one of the alkaloids in Ayahuasca) activates sigma 1 receptor (SIGMAR1) and others. SIGMAR1 is a multi-faceted stress-responsive receptor which promotes cell survival, neuroprotection, neuroplasticity, and neuroimmunomodulation. Simultaneously, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) also present in Ayahuasca prevent the degradation of DMT. One peculiarity of SIGMAR1 activation and MAOI activity is the reversal of mnemonic deficits in pre-clinical models. Since traumatic memories in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are often characterised by \"repression\" and PTSD patients ingesting Ayahuasca report the retrieval of such memories, it cannot be excluded that DMT-mediated SIGMAR1 activation and the concomitant MAOIs effects during Ayahuasca ingestion might mediate such \"anti-amnesic\" process. Here I hypothesise that Ayahuasca, via hyperactivation of trauma and emotional memory-related centres, and via its concomitant SIGMAR1- and MAOIs- induced anti-amnesic effects, facilitates the retrieval of traumatic memories, in turn making them labile (destabilised). As Ayahuasca alkaloids enhance synaptic plasticity, increase neurogenesis and boost dopaminergic neurotransmission, and those processes are involved in memory reconsolidation and fear extinction, the fear response triggered by the memory can be reprogramed and/or extinguished. Subsequently, the memory is stored with this updated significance. To date, it is unclear if new memories replace, co-exist with or bypass old ones. Although the mechanisms involved in memory are still debated, they seem to require the involvement of cellular and molecular events, such as reorganisation of homo and heteroreceptor complexes at the synapse, synaptic plasticity, and epigenetic re-modulation of gene expression. Since SIGMAR1 mobilises synaptic receptor, boosts synaptic plasticity and modulates epigenetic processes, such effects might be involved in the reported healing of traumatic memories in PTSD patients. If this theory proves to be true, Ayahuasca could come to represent the only standing pharmacological treatment which targets traumatic memories in PTSD. Lastly, since SIGMAR1 activation triggers both epigenetic and immunomodulatory programmes, the mechanism here presented could help understanding and treating other conditions in which the cellular memory is dysregulated, such as cancer, diabetes, autoimmune and neurodegenerative pathologies and substance addiction."

The ayahuasca-induced introspective experience has been shown to have potential benefits in the treatment of several pathologies, to protect mental health and to improve neuropsychological functions and creativity, and boost mindfulness. The underlying psychological processes related to the use of ayahuasca in a psychotherapeutic context are not yet well described in the scientific literature, but there is some evidence to suggest that psychological variables described in psychotherapies could be useful in explaining the therapeutic effects of the brew. In this study we explore the link between ayahuasca use and Decentering, Values and Self, comparing subjects without experience of ayahuasca (n = 41) with subjects with experience (n = 81). Results confirm that ayahuasca users scored higher than non-users in Decentering and Positive self, but not in Valued living, Life fulfillment, Self in social relations, Self in close relations and General self. Scores in Decentering were higher in the more experienced subjects (more than 15 occasions) than in those with less experience (less than 15 occasions). Our results show that psychological process variables may explain the outcomes in ayahuasca psychotherapy. The introduction of these variables is warranted in future ayahuasca therapeutic studies.",

One of them is the use of entheogenic substances, like ayahuasca, an infusion obtained from two native plant species from the Amazon. The present report aimed to understand how crack cocaine users recover from drug addiction by consuming ayahuasca tea in a religious context. This is a qualitative study with a purposeful sample of 40 crack cocaine users, based on in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Participants reported that ayahuasca allowed them to access a consciousness dimension which enabled them to solve problems and traumas and reduce crack cocaine consumption. The religious ceremony increased the user's spirituality and the reception from the community gave them a sense of self-esteem, strengthening them in an emotional and social way. That positive experience has been incorporated into the daily routine of most participants. Findings indicate that ayahuasca, in a religious context, may have therapeutic value for crack cocaine dependence treatment.",

This study explored the potential therapeutic value of ayahuasca in the context of EDs, including the perceived impact of the preparatory diet and the ayahuasca purge. Sixteen individuals previously diagnosed with an ED participated in a semi-structured interview relating to their experiences with ceremonial ayahuasca drinking. Interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. Themes presented relate to the reduction or cessation of ED and mental health symptoms, shifts in body perception, and the importance of a ceremonial setting and after-care. For some, the preparatory diet resulted in familiar patterns of concern; however, none felt triggered by the purge in ayahuasca.

      "abstract": "The Quechua term ayahuasca refers to a beverage obtained from decoctions of the liana Banisteriopsis caapi with leaves of Psychotria viridis. The ritualistic use of ayahuasca is becoming a global phenomenon, with some individuals using this beverage throughout life, including in old age. Cognitive impairment is a common manifestation during aging. There are conflicting reports on the ability of some ayahuasca compounds to exert neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects that could improve or impair learning and memory. Animal models provide a relevant and accessible means of investigating the behavioral effects of ayahuasca without the environmental conditions associated with the ritualistic use of the beverage. In this study, we investigated the influence of chronic ayahuasca exposure throughout aging on the spatial reference and habituation memories of mice. Twenty-eight male c57bl/6 mice (6 months old) received ayahuasca or water (1.5 mL/kg, orally) twice a week for 12 months and were tested in the Morris water maze (MWM), open field and elevated plus maze (EPM) tasks before and after treatment. During aging, there was significant impairment in the evocation (but not acquisition) of spatial reference memory and in habituation to the open field. There was also a decrease in locomotor activity in the open field and EPM tests, whereas the anxiety parameters were unaltered. Ayahuasca treatment did not alter any of these parameters associated with aging. These findings indicate that chronic exposure to ayahuasca during aging did not affect memory in mice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ayahuasca is a plant tea containing the psychedelic 5-HT2A agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine and harmala monoamine-oxidase inhibitors. Acute administration leads to neurophysiological modifications in brain regions of the default mode network, purportedly through a glutamatergic mechanism. Post-acutely, ayahuasca potentiates mindfulness capacities in volunteers and induces rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant patients. However, the mechanisms underlying these fast and maintained effects are poorly understood. Here, we investigated in an open-label uncontrolled study in 16 healthy volunteers ayahuasca-induced post-acute neurometabolic and connectivity modifications and their association with mindfulness measures. METHODS: Using 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and functional connectivity, we compared baseline and post-acute neurometabolites and seed-to-voxel connectivity in the posterior and anterior cingulate cortex after a single ayahuasca dose. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed post-acute reductions in glutamate+glutamine, creatine, and N-acetylaspartate+N-acetylaspartylglutamate in the posterior cingulate cortex. Connectivity was increased between the posterior cingulate cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, and between the anterior cingulate cortex and limbic structures in the right medial temporal lobe. Glutamate+glutamine reductions correlated with increases in the \"nonjudging\" subscale of the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire. Increased anterior cingulate cortex-medial temporal lobe connectivity correlated with increased scores on the self-compassion questionnaire. Post-acute neural changes predicted sustained elevations in nonjudging 2 months later. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the involvement of glutamate neurotransmission in the effects of psychedelics in humans. They further suggest that neurometabolic changes in the posterior cingulate cortex, a key region within the default mode network, and increased connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex and medial temporal lobe structures involved in emotion and memory potentially underlie the post-acute psychological effects of ayahuasca.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A range of studies has demonstrated the efficacy of the psychoactive Amazonian brew ayahuasca in addressing substance addiction. These have revealed that physiological and psychological mechanisms are deeply enmeshed. This article focuses on how interactive ritual contexts support the healing effort. The study of psychedelic-assisted treatments for addiction has much to gain from ethnographic analyses of healing experiences within the particular ecologies of use and care, where these interventions are rendered efficacious. METHODS: This is an ethnographically grounded, qualitative analysis of addiction-recovery experiences within ayahuasca rituals. It draws on long-term fieldwork and participant observation in ayahuasca communities, and in-depth, semi-structured interviews of participants with histories of substance misuse. RESULTS: Ayahuasca's efficacy in the treatment of addiction blends somatic, symbolic and collective dimensions. The layering of these effects, and the direction given to them through ritual, circumscribes the experience and provides tools to render it meaningful. Prevailing modes of evaluation are ill suited to account for the particular material and semiotic efficacy of complex interventions such as ayahuasca healing for addiction. The article argues that practices of care characteristic of the ritual spaces in which ayahuasca is collectively consumed, play a key therapeutic role. CONCLUSION: The ritual use of ayahuasca stands in strong contrast to hegemonic understandings of addiction, paving new ground between the overstated difference between community and pharmacological interventions. The article concludes that fluid, adaptable forms of caregiving play a key role in the success of addiction recovery and that feeling part of a community has an important therapeutic potential.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ayahuasca is a South American psychotropic plant tea traditionally used in Amazonian shamanism. The tea contains the psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), plus β-carboline alkaloids with monoamine oxidase-inhibiting properties. Increasing evidence from anecdotal reports and open-label studies indicates that ayahuasca may have therapeutic effects in treatment of substance use disorders and depression. A recent study on the psychological effects of ayahuasca found that the tea reduces judgmental processing and inner reactivity, classic goals of mindfulness psychotherapy. Another psychological facet that could potentially be targeted by ayahuasca is creative divergent thinking. This mode of thinking can enhance and strengthen psychological flexibility by allowing individuals to generate new and effective cognitive, emotional, and behavioral strategies. The present study aimed to assess the potential effects of ayahuasca on creative thinking. METHODS: We visited two spiritual ayahuasca workshops and invited participants to conduct creativity tests before and during the acute effects of ayahuasca. In total, 26 participants consented. Creativity tests included the \"pattern/line meanings test\" (PLMT) and the \"picture concept test\" (PCT), both assessing divergent thinking and the latter also assessing convergent thinking. RESULTS: While no significant effects were found for the PLMT, ayahuasca intake significantly modified divergent and convergent thinking as measured by the PCT. While convergent thinking decreased after intake, divergent thinking increased. CONCLUSIONS: The present data indicate that ayahuasca enhances creative divergent thinking. They suggest that ayahuasca increases psychological flexibility, which may facilitate psychotherapeutic interventions and support clinical trial initiatives.",

Electronic searches were performed using the PubMed, LILACS, and SciELO databases. Only clinical trials published in peer-reviewed journals were included. Of these, 151 studies were identified, of which six met the established criteria. Reviewed studies suggest beneficial effects for treatment-resistant depression, anxiety and depression associated with life-threatening diseases, and tobacco and alcohol dependence. All drugs were well tolerated. In conclusion, ayahuasca, psilocybin and LSD may be useful pharmacological tools for the treatment of drug dependence, and anxiety and mood disorders, especially in treatment-resistant patients. These drugs may also be useful pharmacological tools to understand psychiatric disorders and to develop new therapeutic agents. However, all studies reviewed had small sample sizes, and half of them were open-label, proof-of-concept studies. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with more patients are needed to replicate these preliminary findings."
