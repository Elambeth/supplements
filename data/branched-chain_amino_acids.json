      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated that branched-chain amino acids are neuroprotective and neurorestorative. Branched-chain amino acid supplements are now being recommended to be taken before contact sports to reduce concussions. While peaks and troughs in branched-chain amino acids have previously been reported in hospital settings, the metabolism of a single recommended dose of over-the-counter branched-chain amino acids has yet to be elucidated. METHODS: We analyzed a patented branched-chain amino acid product to assess its metabolism in 10 healthy adults. RESULTS: Over the defined time points, measured levels of branched-chain amino acids remained significantly elevated when compared to the physiological baseline. The elevations in measured plasma levels indicate that a single oral dose is a viable intake option for increasing levels of branched-chain amino acids. CONCLUSIONS: This information can be leveraged to better plan branched-chain amino acid-based treatment doses in order to treat pathologies such as brain injury."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Several studies have identified biomarkers that help in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric disorders. The current study aimed to explore the association between circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and the risk of five psychiatric disorders. METHODS: GWAS summary statistics were obtained from the UK Biobank and the FinnGen Biobank. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was used as a primary method to assess causal effects. The heterogeneity test, the horizontal pleiotropy test, and leave-one-out analysis were used to assess the robustness and reliability of the results. RESULTS: Total BCAA levels were not significantly associated with the risk of anxiety disorders, alcohol dependence, depression, panic disorder, and bipolar affective disorders. Separate analyses for each BCAA showed that the levels of valine and leucine were not associated with the risk of the mentioned five psychiatric disorders, and the levels of isoleucine were not associated with the risk of depression, panic disorder, and bipolar affective disorders, but with the risk of anxiety disorders (IVW: OR = 0.814, 95 %CI = 0.716-0.925) and alcohol dependence (IVW: 0.690, 95 %CI = 0.560-0.849). CONCLUSIONS: Circulating isoleucine was a protective factor for anxiety disorders and alcohol dependence, offering a new research direction and theoretical basis for preventing and managing psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent studies have linked branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) metabolism with the risk of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, it is unclear whether associations of plasma BCAA levels with MDD are causal or driven by reverse causality. METHODS: Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to investigate the causal association of genetically determined BCAA levels with the risk of MDD. The large genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets on plasma BCAA levels (n = 115,051) were obtained from the UK Biobank. The summary GWAS dataset for MDD was obtained from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (n = 1,035,760). We applied the inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method to explore the causal relationships between BCAA levels and MDD, followed by multiple pleiotropy and heterogeneity tests. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that genetically determined circulating total BCAAs (odds ratio (OR): 1.05, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.10, P = 0.016), leucine (OR: 1.06, 95 % CI: 1.02-1.11, P = 7.22 × 10-3), and isoleucine (OR: 1.08, 95 % CI: 1.01-1.16, P = 0.032) levels were associated with an increased risk of MDD. There was suggestive evidence supporting the causal effect of valine levels on MDD (OR: 1.04, 95 % CI: 1.00-1.08, P = 0.075). Bidirectional MR analysis did not provide evidence of reverse causality. CONCLUSIONS: We report evidence supporting the causal role of BCAAs in the development of MDD. This study offers new insights into the mechanisms and treatment of MDD.",

      "abstract": "To investigate the impact of growth hormone (GH) on branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) catabolism in males with hypopituitarism, we measured the concentration of amino acids in 133 males with hypopituitarism and 90 age-matched healthy controls using untargeted metabolome. A rat model of hypopituitarism was established through hypophysectomy, followed by recombinant human GH (rhGH) intervention. Targeted metabolomics and label-free quantitative phosphoproteomics were utilised to assess amino acid levels in rats and explore the mechanisms of GH's effect on BCAA catabolism. Hypopituitarism exhibited elevated concentrations of BCAAs, which correlated positively with triglyceride, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. The BCAAs were significantly elevated following hypophysectomy and were substantially reduced upon rhGH intervention. Phosphorylation proteomics analysis in liver tissues revealed that differentially expressed phosphoproteins (DEPPs) after GH treatment were predominantly involved in 'RNA metabolic process', 'Diseases of signal transduction by growth factor receptors' and 'BCAAs degradation'. Notably, 12 proteins in the BCAA degradation pathway showed altered phosphorylation without whole protein changes. Importantly, the expression or phosphorylation modification of BCKDH, BCATs and MuRF1 were restored through rhGH intervention. Hypopituitarism exhibits elevated levels of circulating BCAAs. The increased circulating BCAAs in hypopituitarism may result from enhanced MuRF1-mediated muscle proteolysis, which greatly exceeds the BCAA degradation capacity. This study provides valuable insights into the effects of GH on BCAA catabolism at the scale of the proteomics level.",

To address this, we conducted a metabolomics study using five analytical methods to identify biomarkers that differentiate menstrual pain severity. This study included 20 women, divided into mild (N = 12) and severe (N = 8) pain groups based on their numerical pain rating scale. We developed pretreatment procedures that allowed all analyses from only 100 µL of finger-prick blood collected across the menstrual cycle. Among the 692 quantified metabolites, branched-chain amino acids and specific phosphatidylinositol (PI), especially PI(36:2), were identified as potential biomarkers. Furthermore, the ratio of PI(36:2) to each BCAA or total BCAA effectively discriminated between the severity levels of menstrual pain. These ratios correlated positively with NPRS, indicating high accuracy in pain assessment. This study highlights the potential of small molecular markers to objectively assess menstrual pain severity, aiding evidence-based support and intervention.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is an etiologically diverse metabolic dysfunction that, if untreated, leads to chronic hyperglycemia. Understanding the etiology of T2DM is critical, as it represents one of the most formidable medical challenges of the twenty-first century. Traditionally, insulin resistance has been recognized as the primary risk factor and a well-known consequence of type 2 diabetes. Emerging evidence suggests that branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), adipokines, and deficiencies in water-soluble vitamins, such as thiamine and pyridoxine, play significant roles in the development of insulin resistance, a key feature of T2DM. These factors are interconnected through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, which regulates various metabolic processes, including glucose transport, lipid synthesis, and inflammatory responses. Dysregulation of AMPK is linked to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome-related illnesses. Understanding the interplay between BCAAs, adipokines, vitamins, and AMPK may offer new therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus."

While BCAAs are known to influence cancer biology, their role in leukemia remains unclear. This study employs Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the causal relationship between BCAA levels and four leukemia subtypes: acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). METHODS: Data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were used to select single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables (IVs) for BCAA levels. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method served as the primary analytical approach, with heterogeneity assessed via Cochran's Q test and pleiotropy through MR-Egger intercept. Sensitivity analysis was performed using leave-one-out analysis. RESULTS: A significant inverse association was observed between total BCAA levels, leucine, valine, and ALL risk. Total BCAA levels showed an odds ratio (OR) of 0.16 (95% CI: 0.05-0.54, p=0.003), leucine 0.17 (95% CI: 0.04-0.61, p=0.007), and valine 0.21 (95% CI: 0.07-0.61, p=0.004). No significant associations were found for AML, CLL, or CML. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that BCAAs, particularly leucine and valine, may protect against ALL, offering insights into leukemia metabolic regulation and potential targets for prevention and therapy.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidences suggests that the disrupted branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) homeostasis and elevated BCAAs promote obesity-related insulin resistance (IR). Exercise improves insulin sensitivity. However, whether BCAAs plays a role in the exercise-attenuated IR remains to be fully investigated. METHODS: In this study, male C57BL/6J mice were induced to become diet-induced obese (DIO) and served as subjects. The initial investigation focused on the impact of exercise on IR and BCAAs. The DIO mice were randomly assigned to either a sedentary group (CON, n = 16) or an exercise group (EX, n = 16). The EX group underwent a 12-week aerobic exercise regimen on a treadmill. After 12-week, plasma BCAAs and branched-chain keto acids (BCKAs) were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were performed, and the expression and phosphorylation of BCAAs catabolic proteins, as well as AKT T308 in gastrocnemius muscle and liver tissues, were evaluated using western blotting. Subsequently, the study explored the role of BCAAs in enhancing IR through exercise. Mice were randomly allocated into 4 groups: sedentary group (CON, n = 8), sedentary with BCAAs supplementation group (CON+BCAA, n = 8), exercise group (EX, n = 16), and exercise with BCAAs supplementation group (EX+BCAA, n = 16). The exercise protocol was as above. Mice in the BCAAs supplemented groups received drinking water containing 2% BCAAs. After 12-week, plasma BCAAs and BCKAs were measured, GTT and ITT tests were performed, and the phosphorylation of AKT T308, as well as p70S6K T389 in gastrocnemius muscle and liver, were compared between the EX group and the EX+BCAA group. Additionally, the phosphorylation of AMPKα T172 in both tissues was measured across all four groups. RESULTS: 12-week aerobic exercise improved insulin sensitivity in DIO mice while inducing BCAAs catabolic protein expression in skeletal muscle and liver, and reducing the plasma BCAAs level. Importantly, BCAAs supplementation elevated the plasma level of BCAAs and counteracted the exercise-attenuated IR. In skeletal muscle and liver tissues, BCAAs supplementation impaired the exercise-improved insulin signaling without enhancing mammalian target of rapamycin activity. AMPK activity was enhanced by aerobic exercise, which was abolished by BCAAs supplementation. CONCLUSION: Aerobic exercise attenuated insulin resistance via restoring BCAAs homeostasis and AMPK activity. The impacts of BCAAs intake on the metabolic effects of exercise sheds light on the combined exercise and nutrition intervention strategy for diabetes management."

      "abstract": "Frailty in cirrhosis or advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) is a relevant prognostic factor. In the present study, we aimed to analyze potential biomarkers associated with frailty and its improvement in patients with ACLD. We analyzed the serum of outpatients with ACLD who participated in a previous study (Román, Hepatol Commun 2024) in which frailty was assessed using the liver frailty index (LFI), and patients who were frail or prefrail were randomized to a multifactorial intervention (home exercise, branched-chain amino acids, and probiotics) or control for 12 months. We determined a biomarker battery of inflammation, bacterial translocation, and liver damage in blood and urine and blood metabolomics by 1H-NMR. Thirty-seven patients were included. According to the LFI, 32 patients were frail or prefrail, and 5 were robust. At baseline, LFI correlated with LBP, sCD163, mtDNA, FGF-21, urinary NGAL, urinary claudin-3, and the metabolites mannose, ethanol, and isoleucine. During the study, patients in the intervention group showed an improvement in LFI and a decrease in CRP, LBP, sCD163, and ccK18 compared to the control group. Metabolomics showed a decrease in dimethyl sulfone and creatinine and an increase in malonate, ornithine, isoleucine, and valine in the intervention group. We conclude that frailty in patients with ACLD is associated with biomarkers of systemic inflammation, bacterial translocation, and liver damage, and alterations of amino acid and short-chain fatty acid metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) including leucine, isoleucine and valine have been linked with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. BCAAs homeostasis is tightly controlled by their catabolic pathway. BCKA dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex is the rate-limiting step for BCAA catabolism. Mitochondrial phosphatase 2C (PP2Cm) dephosphorylates the BCKD E1alpha subunit and activates BCKD complex. Deficiency of PP2Cm impairs BCAA catabolism, leading to higher plasma BCAA concentrations. Emerging evidence shows that bile acids are key regulators of glucose, lipid and energy metabolism. In this study, we investigated whether a direct link existed between BCAAs and bile acids metabolism. Wild-type mice were fed with normal-BCAA or high-BCAA diet, while PP2Cm deficiency mice were fed with normal chow for 14 weeks. The mice were fasted for 6 h before tissue harvest to exclude metabolic changes due to immediate food intake. We showed that the bile acids in tissues and feces were significantly elevated in wild-type mice fed with high-BCAA diet as well as in PP2Cm deficiency mice fed with normal chow. These mice displayed significantly increased expression of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid synthesis in liver, and 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), a freely diffusible metabolite downstream of CYP7A1 in plasma. BCAAs induced Cyp7a1 expression in cultured hepatocytes. In mouse liver and cultured hepatocytes, we demonstrated that elevated BCAAs inhibited fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) expression and ERK signaling pathway. Direct inhibition of ERK by U0126 (800 nM) markedly induced Cyp7a1 expression in cultured hepatocytes. Moreover, the induced Cyp7a1 expression and inhibitory effects of BCAAs on ERK signaling pathway were abolished by treatment with recombinant FGF21 protein in mouse liver and cultured hepatocytes. Collectively, this study demonstrates a direct link between BCAAs and bile acid synthesis. BCAAs promotes Cyp7a1 expression and bile acid synthesis in liver via inhibiting FGF21-ERK signaling pathway. BCAAs-regulated bile acid synthesis and homeostasis may contribute to developing novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of metabolic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Three hundred and sixty sows were used to investigate the effect of various dietary branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) levels on sow lactation and piglet growth performance. On day 112 ± 1.4 of gestation, sows were blocked by the parity group (P1, P2, P3+) and randomly assigned to 1 of 6 dietary treatments containing various levels of standardized ileal digestible (SID) Leu, Ile, and Val. The experimental diets were formulated to the desired levels of BCAA by replacing cornstarch in a basal diet with l-leucine, l-isoleucine, and l-valine. Dietary BCAA levels relative to SID Lys were 114% or 180% for Leu, 56% or 64% for Ile, and 64% or 120% for Val. Diets were formulated to be isocaloric (3.23 Mcal ME/kg) and met or exceeded all other NRC (2012) essential amino acid and vitamin and mineral recommendations. Sow body weight (BW) and backfat thickness were measured at the time of entry into the farrowing room and at weaning. Piglet litter weights were recorded after cross-fostering and weaning to calculate the litter growth rate. Data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models with fixed effects of dietary treatment and parity group and a random effect of lactation group. The models were fit using R (v4.4.1; R Core Team, 2024). The sow and her litter were the experimental unit, and results were considered significant if P < 0.05. On average, sows nursed their litters for 21.3 d (P = 0.998). The mean parity by treatment ranged from 3.8 to 3.9 (P = 0.999). After farrowing, the mean sow BW was 220 kg with a range between treatments of 216 to 222 kg (P = 0.523). On average, sows gained 2.3% of their BW (P = 0.740) with an average daily feed intake of 8.74 kg/d (P = 0.903). As expected, sow Leu, Ile, and Val intakes were different across treatments (P ≤ 0.001) and corresponded to the varying dietary levels of BCAA. Sows entered farrowing with an average backfat thickness of 11.50 mm (P = 0.919) and lost 6.5% backfat through lactation (P = 0.880). Sows started the trial with an average of 14.1 piglets/sow (P = 0.967) and weaned 12.7 piglets/sow (P = 0.995) with a piglet ADG of 0.22 kg/d (P = 0.280) and a daily litter growth rate of 2.90 kg/d (P = 0.547). In conclusion, there was no evidence of an effect of the various leucine, isoleucine, and valine levels evaluated in this study on lactating sow and piglet performance."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are widely studied for their effects on muscle recovery and performance. AIMS: This study examined the effects of BCAA supplementation on anthropometric data, physical performance, delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and fatigue in recreational weightlifters. METHODS: The trial involved 100 participants (50 men and 50 women), randomized into BCAA and placebo groups. Subjects in the BCAA group took five daily capsules of 500 mg L-leucine, 250 mg L-isoleucine, and 250 mg L-valine for six months. A two-way ANOVA was used to analyze the main and interaction effects of sex and treatment. RESULTS: Notable findings include significant improvements in muscle recovery, as indicated by reduced DOMS, particularly in women who showed a decrement of 18.1 ± 9.4 mm compared to 0.8 ± 1.2 mm in the placebo group of a horizontal 100 mm line. Fatigue perception was also significantly lower in the BCAA group, with women reporting a greater decrease (2.6 ± 1.5 scores) compared to the placebo group (0.6 ± 0.7 scores). Strength gains were prominent, especially in men, with a 10% increase in bench press maximum observed in the BCAA group. The interaction between sex and treatment was significant, suggesting sex-specific responses to BCAA supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: These results underscore the effectiveness of BCAA supplementation in enhancing muscle recovery, reducing fatigue, and improving strength. This study also highlights sex-specific responses, with women benefiting more in terms of DOMS and fatigue reduction, while men experienced greater strength gains, suggesting a need for tailored supplementation strategies."

      "abstract": "The adverse metabolic impacts of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) have been elucidated are mediated by isoleucine and valine. Dietary restriction of isoleucine promotes metabolic health and increases lifespan. However, a high protein diet enriched in BCAA is presently the most useful therapeutic strategy for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), yet, its underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome (FLHS), a specialized laying hen NAFLD model, can spontaneously develop fatty liver and hepatic steatosis under a high-energy and high-protein dietary background that the pathogenesis of FLHS is similar to human NAFLD. The mechanism underlying dietary BCAA control of NAFLD development in laying hens remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that dietary supplementation with 67 % High BCAA has unique mitigative impacts on NAFLD in laying hens. A High BCAA diet alleviates NAFLD, by inhibiting the tryptophan-ILA-AHR axis and MAPK9-mediated de novo lipogenesis (DNL), promoting ketogenesis and energy metabolism, and activating PPAR-RXR and pexophagy to promote fatty acid β-oxidation. Furthermore, we uncover that High BCAA strongly activates ubiquitin-proteasome autophagy via downregulating UFMylation to trigger MAPK9-mediated DNL, fatty acid elongation and lipid droplet formation-related proteins ubiquitination degradation, activating PPAR-RXR and pexophagy mediated fatty acid β-oxidation and lipolysis. Together, our data highlight moderating intake of high BCAA by inhibiting the AHR/MAPK9 are promising new strategies in NAFLD and FLHS treatment.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Accumulation of circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) is a hallmark feature of impaired insulin sensitivity. As intracellular BCAA catabolism is dependent on glycine availability, we hypothesised that the concurrent measurement of circulating glycine and BCAA may yield a stronger association with markers of insulin sensitivity than either BCAA or glycine alone. This study therefore examined the correlative relationships of BCAA, BCAA and glycine together, plus glycine alone on insulin sensitivity-related markers before and after an 8-week low energy diet (LED) intervention. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the PREVIEW (PREVention of diabetes through lifestyle Intervention and population studies in Europe and around the World) Study New Zealand sub-cohort. Eligible participants with pre-diabetes at baseline who achieved ≥8 % body weight loss following an LED intervention were included, of which 167 paired (Week 0 and Week 8) blood samples were available for amino acid analysis. Glycemic and other data were retrieved from the PREVIEW consortium database. Repeated measures linear mixed models were used to test the association between amino acids and insulin sensitivity-related markers (HOMA2-IR, glucose, insulin, and C-peptide). RESULTS: Elevated BCAA was associated with impaired insulin sensitivity (p < 0.05), with strength of association (ηp2) almost doubled when glycine was added to the model. However, glycine in isolation was not associated with insulin sensitivity-related markers. The magnitude (β-estimates) of positive association between BCAA and HOMA2-IR, and inverse association between glycine and HOMA2-IR, increased when body weight was higher (Body weight∗BCAA, Body weight∗glycine, p < 0.05, both). CONCLUSION: Low serum glycine strengthened the association between BCAA and impaired insulin sensitivity. Given that glycine is necessary to facilitate intracellular BCAA catabolism, measurement of glycine is necessary to complement BCAA analysis to comprehensively understand the contribution of amino acid metabolism in insulin sensitivity.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is a global epidemic, and the low-grade chronic inflammation of adipose tissue in obese individuals can lead to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are the main source of pro-inflammatory cytokines in adipose tissue, making them an important target for therapy. While branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) have been strongly linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans, the relationship between BCAA catabolism and adipose tissue inflammation is unclear. This study aims to investigate whether disrupted BCAA catabolism influences the function of adipose tissue macrophages and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in adipose tissue, and to determine the underlying mechanism. This research will help us better understand the role of BCAA catabolism in adipose tissue inflammation, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: In vivo, we examined whether the BCAA catabolism in ATMs was altered in high-fat diet-induced obesity mice, and if BCAA supplementation would influence obesity, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, adipose tissue inflammation and ATMs polarization in mice. In vitro, we isolated ATMs from standard chow and high BCAA-fed group mice, using RNA-sequencing to investigate the potential molecular pathway regulated by BCAA accumulation. Finally, we performed targeted gene silence experiment and used immunoblotting assays to verify our findings. RESULTS: We found that BCAA catabolic enzymes in ATMs were influenced by high-fat diet induced obesity mice, which caused the accumulation of both BCAA and its downstream BCKA. BCAA supplementation will cause obesity and insulin resistance compared to standard chow (STC) group. And high BCAA diet will induce pro-inflammatory cytokines including Interlukin-1beta (IL-1β), Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) secretion in adipose tissue as well as promoting ATMs M1 polarization (pro-inflammatory phenotype). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that a high BCAA diet would activate IFNGR1/JAK1/STAT1 pathway, and IFNGR1 specific silence can abolish the effect of BCAA supplementation-induced inflammation and ATMs M1 polarization. CONCLUSIONS: The obesity mice model reveals the catabolism of BCAA was disrupted which will cause the accumulation of BCAA, and high-level BCAA will promote ATMs M1 polarization and increase the pro-inflammatory cytokines in adipose tissue which will cause the insulin resistance in further. Therefore, reducing the circulating level of BCAA can be a therapeutic strategy in obesity and insulin resistance patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The essential branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine are considered anabolic and stimulate protein synthesis in the muscles as well in the liver. They also promote muscle recovery and contribute to glucose homeostasis. Recent studies in critically ill patients have demonstrated that depletion of plasma leucine is associated with increased mortality, but data in the non-critical care setting is lacking. METHODS: This secondary analysis of the randomized controlled Effect of early nutritional support on Frailty, Functional Outcomes, and Recovery of malnourished medical inpatients Trial (EFFORT), investigated the impact of leucine, isoleucine, and valine metabolism on clinical outcomes. The primary endpoint was 180-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Among 238 polymorbid patients with available metabolite measurements, low serum leucin levels were associated with a doubled risk of 180-day all-cause mortality in a fully adjusted regression model (adjusted HR 2.20 [95% CI 1.46-3.30], p < 0.001). There was also an association with mortality for isoleucine (1.56 [95% CI 1.03-2.35], p = 0.035) and valine (1.69 [95% CI 1.13-2.53], p = 0.011). When comparing effects of nutritional support on mortality in patients with high and low levels of leucine, there was no evidence of significant differences in effectiveness of the intervention. The same was true for isoleucine and valine. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that depletion of leucine, isoleucine, and valine among malnourished polymorbid patients is associated with increases in long-term mortality. However, patients with low metabolite levels did not show a pronounced benefit from nutritional support. Further research should focus on the clinical effects of nutritional support in patients with depleted stores of essential branched-chain amino acids.

Enhancing saltiness is an effective strategy for salt reduction, and the development of salt-reduced foods using these saltiness-enhancing flavorants as food additives is underway. However, an increasing number of consumers demand a reduction in additives in clean-label foods. OBJECTIVE: Enzyme processing of food is an attractive strategy for developing clean-label foods because enzymes are not considered additives. We aimed to improve the saltiness and umami intensity of vegetable soups by enzyme treatment while meeting clean-label requirements. We first optimized the enzymatic reaction conditions of a protease and glutaminase blend and then investigated the synergistic effects of this enzyme blend on the taste of vegetable soup. RESULTS: Sensory evaluations indicated that the reaction products (e.g., protein hydrolysates or amino acids) could enhance the umami, kokumi, and saltiness intensity of vegetable soup supplemented with 0.5% NaCl. Notably, the saltiness intensity ratio of the enzyme-treated soup with 0.50, 0.45, and 0.40% NaCl were increased by 1.31-, 1.16-, and 0.99-fold, respectively, when this ratio for the control soup with 0.50% NaCl was set to 1.0. This indicates a 20% salt reduction rate can be achieved by enzyme treatment. Moreover, we found that these enhancements were synergically caused by enzyme-produced glutamic acid and branched-chain amino acids. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that using enzyme blends of bacterial and fungal proteases and glutaminase is an effective approach to enhancing the saltiness levels of vegetable soups while meeting clean-label requirements."

However, the causality remained unclear. OBJECTIVE: Herein, we aimed to determine the potential impact of gut microbiota and gut microbiota-derived metabolites on PD risk using a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. METHODS: We included as exposures gut microbial taxa abundance and gut-derived metabolites (branched chain amino acids [BCAAs]), with PD as the outcome. In addition, we explored whether BCAAs act as a mediating factor in the pathway from gut microbiota to PD. RESULTS: We found evidence of a causality of 15 microbial taxa and PD before and after sensitivity analyses, but not after multiple testing correction. There was significant association between BCAAs levels and the risk of PD, especially isoleucine (OR = 0.995, 95% CI 0.992-0.999, p = 0.004, pFDR = 0.012). In addition, the causality of gut microbiota and BCAAs was also explored that the increased g_Coprococcus abundance can result in the decrease in isoleucine level (OR = 1.046; 95% CI, 1.009-1.085; p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated suggestive association between gut microbiota and its metabolites and PD. Furthermore, higher BCAAs levels were associated with the decreased PD risk. This study may provide new targets for PD treatment, such as dietary BCAAs supplementation.",

      "abstract": "Reduced liver function, increased oxidative stress, and inflammation in early lactation negatively affect lactation performance and health of fresh cows. Previous findings from our group demonstrated that branched-chain AA (BCAA) infusion improved lactation performance and branched-chain keto-acids (BCKA) infusion decreased liver triglyceride (TG) in fresh cows. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of BCAA and BCKA on blood and liver biomarkers of liver function, oxidative stress, and inflammation as well as expression of genes regulating inflammation and antioxidant metabolism in the liver. Thirty multiparous Holstein cows were used in a randomized block design receiving continuous abomasal infusion for 21 d after parturition. Treatments (10 cows each) were control (CON), cows abomasally infused with 0.9% saline; cows abomasally infused with BCAA (67 g valine, 50 g leucine, and 34 g isoleucine; BCA); and cows abomasally infused with BCKA (77 g keto-valine, 57 g keto-leucine, and 39 g keto-isoleucine; BCK). All cows were randomly assigned to treatments after parturition and received the same diet throughout the experimental period. Blood was collected at 3, 7, 14, and 21 d postpartum for liver function, oxidative stress, and inflammation biomarker profiling. Liver was also harvested on 7, 14, and 21 d postpartum for quantification of glutathione, protein carbonylation, and expression of genes. ANOVA was conducted for all data using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS. No treatment differences were observed for liver function biomarkers (bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and aspartate aminotransferase). Cows receiving BCAA had lower blood NO2- and NO3- concentrations compared with CON. A tendency for lower advanced oxidized protein products was also observed in BCA cows compared with CON. Additionally, on d 7, BCA cows had lower protein carbonylation in the liver compared with CON. In contrast, BCK cows had higher plasma thiol and albumin, as well as liver reduced and total glutathione compared with CON cows. Compared with CON, BCK cows had higher expression glutathione reductase in the liver. Overall, these results suggest favorable alterations in oxidative stress and inflammation status in fresh cows receiving BCAA or BCKA infusion during the first 3 wk of lactation, which likely contributed to previously-observed changes in lactation performance and liver TG concentrations. Future work is required to evaluate the interrelated metabolism of BCAA and BCKA to better understand their effects on oxidative and immune metabolism.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) have been affected epilepsy, yet conclusions remain inconclusive, lacking causal evidence regarding whether BCAAs affect epilepsy. Systematic exploration of the causal relationship between BCAAs and epilepsy could hand out new ideas for the treatment of epilepsy. METHODS: Utilizing bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study, we investigated the causal relationship between BCAA levels and epilepsy. BCAA levels from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including total BCAAs, leucine levels, isoleucine levels, and valine levels, were employed. Causal relationships were explored applying the method of inverse variance-weighted (IVW) and MR-Egger, followed by sensitivity analyses of the results to evaluate heterogeneity and pleiotropy. RESULTS: Through strict genetic variant selection, we find some related SNPs, total BCAA levels (9), leucine levels (11), isoleucine levels (7), and valine levels (6) as instrumental variables for our MR analysis. Following IVW and sensitivity analysis, total BCAAs levels (OR = 1.14, 95 % CI = 1.019 ∼ 1.285, P = 0.022) and leucine levels (OR = 1.15, 95 % CI = 1.018 ∼ 1.304, P = 0.025) had significant correlation with epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS: There exists a causal relationship between the levels of total BCAAs and leucine with epilepsy, offering the new ideas into epilepsy potential mechanisms, holding significant implications for its prevention and treatment.",

Treatment of C2C12 myotubes with whey protein culture supernatant (1%, 2% and 3%, v/v) using L. plantarum LM1001 significantly increased the expression of myogenic regulatory factors, such as Myf-5, MyoD, and myogenin, reflecting the promotion of myotubes formation (p<0.05). L. plantarum LM1001 displayed β-galactosidase activity but did not produce harmful β-glucuronidase.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that alterations in BCAA metabolism may contribute to the pathogenesis of sarcopenia. However, the relationship between branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and sarcopenia is incompletely understood, and existing literature presents conflicting results. In this study, we conducted a community-based study involving > 100,000 United Kingdom adults to comprehensively explore the association between BCAAs and sarcopenia, and assess the potential role of muscle mass in mediating the relationship between BCAAs and muscle strength. METHODS: Multivariable linear regression analysis examined the relationship between circulating BCAAs and muscle mass/strength. Logistic regression analysis assessed the impact of circulating BCAAs and quartiles of BCAAs on sarcopenia risk. Subgroup analyses explored the variations in associations across age, and gender. Mediation analysis investigated the potential mediating effect of muscle mass on the BCAA-muscle strength relationship. RESULTS: Among 108,017 participants (mean age: 56.40 ± 8.09 years; 46.23% men), positive associations were observed between total BCAA, isoleucine, leucine, valine, and muscle mass (beta, 0.56-2.53; p < 0.05) and between total BCAA, leucine, valine, and muscle strength (beta, 0.91-3.44; p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that increased circulating valine was associated with a 47% reduced sarcopenia risk (odds ratio = 0.53; 95% confidence interval = 0.3-0.94; p = 0.029). Subgroup analyses demonstrated strong associations between circulating BCAAs and muscle mass/strength in men and individuals aged ≥ 60 years. Mediation analysis suggested that muscle mass completely mediated the relationship between total BCAA, and valine levels and muscle strength, partially mediated the relationship between leucine levels and muscle strength, obscuring the true effect of isoleucine on muscle strength. CONCLUSION: This study suggested the potential benefits of BCAAs in preserving muscle mass/strength and highlighted muscle mass might be mediator of BCAA-muscle strength association. Our findings contribute new evidence for the clinical prevention and treatment of sarcopenia and related conditions involving muscle mass/strength loss.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Frailty is a predictive factor of hospitalization, falls, and mortality in patients with cirrhosis, regardless of the degree of liver failure. The aim was to analyze whether a multifactorial intervention consisting of home-based exercise, branched-chain amino acids, and a multistrain probiotic can improve frailty in these patients. METHODS: Outpatients with cirrhosis were classified according to the Liver Frailty Index (LFI). Prefrail and frail patients were randomized into 2 groups. The intervention group was assigned to a multifactorial intervention consisting of exercise at home, branched-chain amino acid supplements, and a multistrain probiotic for 12 months. The control group received standard care. All patients were prospectively followed up every 3 months for 1 year to determine LFI, incidence of falls, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and mortality. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were included: 17 patients were assigned to the intervention group and 15 to the control group. In the intervention group, the baseline LFI decreased at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (p = 0.019 for overall change with respect to the control group). The change in LFI (ΔLFI) at 12 months was -0.71 ± 0.24 in the intervention group and -0.09 ± 0.32 in the control group (p<0.001). During follow-up, patients in the intervention group had a lower 1-year probability of falls (6% vs. 47%, p = 0.03) and emergency room visits (10% vs. 44%, p = 0.04) than patients in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: A long-term multifactorial intervention that included exercise at home, branched-chain amino acids, and a multistrain probiotic improved frailty in outpatients with cirrhosis and was associated with a decrease in the incidence of clinical events such as falls and emergency room visits.",

      "abstract": "The kinetics of the chlorination of leucine, isoleucine, and valine (BCAAs) was studied in excess HOCl by stopped-flow and spectrophotometric methods (25 ◦C, I = 1.0 M NaClO4). The intermediates and products were identified and monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy. It was established that these reactions are fully analogous and proceed according to distinct mechanisms under alkaline and neutral conditions. At high pH, the formation and subsequent rate determining decomposition of N-monochloroamino acid control the process. The decomposition occurs via competing pH-independent and OH--assisted reaction paths and the sequence of chlorination, dichlorination and decarboxylation steps leads to the formation of N-chloroimines and their carbanionic forms, which are in fast acid - base equilibria. The dechlorination of the carbanions yields nitriles as the main products. The hydration of the N-chloro imines produces chloramine and aldehydes which are involved in further oxidation reactions with HOCl. The formation of chloroform and chloroacetaldehyde was confirmed in each system. At pH 7.0, the N-chloro derivatives of BCAAs form immediately and are converted into the corresponding N,N-dichloro species within a few seconds after mixing the reactants. In this reaction, the reactive form of the oxidant is Cl2O. The first-order decomposition of the dichloroamino acids occurs on stopped-flow timescale (k = 0.5 - 0.7 s-1) and yields N-chloroimines which slowly decompose with a characteristic first-order rate constant on the order of a few times 10-5 s-1. The main products are the corresponding nitriles that account for about 80% and 60% of the original amounts of amino acids under neutral and alkaline (cOH- = 5.00 × 10-2 M) conditions, respectively. Aldehydes, carboxylic acids, chloroform and NCl3 were also identified as by-products. The results unequivocally confirm that harmful chlorinated species may form from amino acids long after the chlorination step in water treatment technologies that deteriorates the quality of the finished water. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATION: In source waters, amino acids account for about 75% of the total dissolved nitrogen. Therefore, it is an essential issue how the reactions of these compounds with hypochlorite ion can be controlled to avoid the formation of toxic compounds. The compounds formed from BCAAs are considered to be harmful both under alkaline and neutral conditions (chloroacetaldehyde, chloroform, nitriles). However, some of the intermediates have extended lifetime in these systems and they may also react with other components of raw water during water treatment processes."

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the effect of adrenal disorders on the inflammation marker glycoprotein acetylation (GlycA), total branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), ketone bodies, and the gut microbiome-derived metabolites trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and betaine. METHODS: We conducted a single-center cross-sectional study of patients with nonfunctioning adenomas (NFAs), mild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS), primary aldosteronism (PA), Cushing syndrome (CS), pheochromocytoma/paragangliomas (PPGLs), other benign or malignant adrenal masses, and adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) between January 2015 and July 2022 (n = 802). Referent individuals included participants in the PREVEND (Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease) study (n = 5241). GlycA, BCAAs, ketone bodies, TMAO, and betaine were measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Multivariable logistic analyses were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and statin therapy. RESULTS: In age- and sex-adjusted comparison to referent individuals, increased GlycA was noted in all patient categories, increased BCAAs in NFA, MACS, CS, PA, and ACC, increased TMAO in patients with other malignant adrenal masses, increased betaine in NFA and MACS, and increased ketone bodies in NFA, CS, and ACC. Essentially similar findings were observed in fully adjusted analysis and after exclusion of participants with diabetes and CV disease. CONCLUSION: Patients with functioning and nonfunctioning adrenal masses demonstrated increased GlycA and BCAAs, biomarkers associated with adverse cardiometabolic disorders and mortality. Patients with NFA demonstrated an adverse metabolic profile similar to patients with MACS and CS.",

      "abstract": "Concussion is a common injury in the adolescent and young adult populations. Although branched chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation has shown improvements in neurocognitive and sleep function in pre-clinical animal models of mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI), to date, no studies have been performed evaluating the efficacy of BCAAs in concussed adolescents and young adults. The goal of this pilot trial was to determine the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of varied doses of oral BCAA supplementation in a group of concussed adolescents and young adults. The study was conducted as a pilot, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of participants ages 11-34 presenting with concussion to outpatient clinics (sports medicine and primary care), urgent care, and emergency departments of a tertiary care pediatric children's hospital and an urban tertiary care adult hospital, between June 24, 2014 and December 5, 2020. Participants were randomized to one of five study arms (placebo and 15 g, 30 g, 45 g, and 54 g BCAA treatment daily) and followed for 21 days after enrollment. Outcome measures included daily computerized neurocognitive tests (processing speed, the a priori primary outcome; and attention, visual learning, and working memory), symptom score, physical and cognitive activity, sleep/wake alterations, treatment compliance, and adverse events. In total, 42 participants were randomized, 38 of whom provided analyzable data. We found no difference in our primary outcome of processing speed between the arms; however, there was a significant reduction in total symptom score (decrease of 4.4 points on a 0-54 scale for every 500 g of study drug consumed, p value for trend = 0.0036, [uncorrected]) and return to physical activity (increase of 0.503 points on a 0-5 scale for every 500 g of study drug consumed, p value for trend = 0.005 [uncorrected]). There were no serious adverse events. Eight of 38 participants reported a mild (not interfering with daily activity) or moderate (limitation of daily activity) adverse event; there were no differences in adverse events by arm, with only two reported mild adverse events (both gastrointestinal) in the highest (45 g and 54 g) BCAA arms. Although limited by slow enrollment, small sample size, and missing data, this study provides the first demonstration of efficacy, as well as safety and tolerability, of BCAAs in concussed adolescents and young adults; specifically, a dose-response effect in reducing concussion symptoms and a return to baseline physical activity in those treated with higher total doses of BCAAs. These findings provide important preliminary data to inform a larger trial of BCAA therapy to expedite concussion recovery.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is the most prevalent liver disease, whereas type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is considered an independent risk factor for MAFLD incidence. Taohe Chengqi decoction (THCQ) is clinically prescribed for T2DM treatment; however, the hepatoprotective effect of THCQ against MAFLD is still unknown. This study intended to elucidate the therapeutic effect of THCQ on T2DM-associated MAFLD and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: THCQ lyophilized powder was prepared and analyzed by UHPLC-MS/MS. A stable T2DM mouse model was established by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding combined with streptozotocin (STZ) injection. The T2DM mice were administered THCQ (2.5 g/kg or 5 g/kg) to explore the pharmacological effects of THCQ on T2DM-associated MAFLD. Liver tissue transcriptome was analyzed and the participatory roles of PPARα/γ pathways were verified both in vivo and in vitro. Serum metabolome analysis was used to explore the metabolome changes and skeletal muscle branched chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic enzymes were further detected. Moreover, an AAV carrying BCKDHA shRNA was intramuscularly injected to verify the impact of THCQ on skeletal muscle BCAA catabolism and the potential therapeutic outcome on hepatic steatosis. RESULTS: THCQ improved hepatic steatosis in MAFLD. RNA-sequencing analysis showed dysregulation in the hepatic PPARγ-related fatty acid synthesis, while PPARα-dependent fatty acid oxidation was elevated following THCQ treatment. Interestingly, in vitro analyses of these findings showed that THCQ had minor effects on fatty acid oxidation and/or synthesis. The metabolomic study revealed that THCQ accelerated BCAA catabolism in the skeletal muscles, in which knockdown of the BCAA catabolic enzyme BCKDHA diminished the THCQ therapeutic effect on hepatic steatosis. CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the potential therapeutic effect of THCQ on hepatic steatosis in MALFD. THCQ upregulated fatty acid oxidation and reduced its synthesis via restoration of PPARα/γ pathways in HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice, which is mediated through augmenting BCKDH activity and accelerating BCAA catabolism in the skeletal muscles. Overall, this study provided in-depth clues for \"skeletal muscles-liver communication\" in the therapeutic effect of THCQ against hepatic steatosis. These findings suggested THCQ might be a potential candidate against T2DM-associated MAFLD.",

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis is closely associated with the dysregulation of gut microbiota. There is growing evidence that natural products may improve ulcerative colitis by regulating the gut microbiota. In this research, we demonstrated that bergenin, a naturally occurring isocoumarin, significantly ameliorates colitis symptoms in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mice. Transcriptomic analysis and Caco-2 cell assays revealed that bergenin could ameliorate ulcerative colitis by inhibiting TLR4 and regulating NF-κB and mTOR phosphorylation. 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics analyses revealed that bergenin could improve gut microbiota dysbiosis by decreasing branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) levels. BCAA intervention mediated the mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway to exacerbate the symptoms of ulcerative colitis in mice. Notably, bergenin greatly decreased the symbiotic bacteria Bacteroides vulgatus (B. vulgatus), and the gavage of B. vulgatus increased BCAA concentrations and aggravated the symptoms of ulcerative colitis in mice. Our findings suggest that gut microbiota-mediated BCAA metabolism plays a vital role in the protective effect of bergenin on ulcerative colitis, providing novel insights for ulcerative colitis prevention through manipulation of the gut microbiota.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dairy cows are at high risk of fatty liver disease in early lactation, but current preventative measures are not always effective. Cows with fatty liver have lower circulating branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) concentrations whereas cows with high circulating BCAA levels have low liver triglyceride (TG). Our objective was to determine the impact of BCAA and their corresponding ketoacids (branched-chain ketoacids, BCKA) on production performance and liver TG accumulation in Holstein cows in the first 3 weeks postpartum. METHODS: Thirty-six multiparous Holstein cows were used in a randomized block design experiment. Cows were abomasally infused for the first 21 d postpartum with solutions of 1) saline (CON, n = 12); 2) BCA (67 g valine, 50 g leucine, and 34 g isoleucine, n = 12); and 3) BCK (77 g 2-ketovaline calcium salt, 57 g 2-ketoleucine calcium salt, and 39 g 2-ketoisoleucine calcium salt, n = 12). All cows received the same diet. Treatment effects were determined using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS. RESULTS: No differences were detected for body weight, body condition score, or dry matter intake averaged over the first 21 d postpartum. Cows receiving BCK had significantly lower liver TG concentrations compared to CON (6.60% vs. 4.77%, standard error of the mean (SEM) 0.49) during the first 3 weeks of lactation. Infusion of BCA increased milk yield (39.5 vs. 35.3 kg/d, SEM 1.8), milk fat yield (2.10 vs. 1.69 kg/d, SEM 0.08), and lactose yield (2.11 vs. 1.67 kg/d, SEM 0.07) compared with CON. Compared to CON, cows receiving BCA had lower plasma glucose (55.0 vs. 59.2 mg/dL, SEM 0.86) but higher β-hydroxybutyrate (9.17 vs. 6.00 mg/dL, SEM 0.80). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, BCAA supplementation in this study improved milk production, whereas BCKA supplementation reduced TG accumulation in the liver of fresh cows."

      "abstract": "Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) are essential for maintaining intestinal mucosal integrity. However, only a few studies have explored the role of BCAA in the modulation of intestinal inflammation. In this study, we investigated in vitro effects of BCAA on the inflammatory response induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 µg/mL) in Caco-2 cells. Caco-2 cells were assigned to six groups: control without BCAA (CTL0), normal BCAA (CTL; 0.8 mM leucine, 0.8 mM isoleucine, and 0.8 mM valine); leucine (LEU; 2 mM leucine), isoleucine (ISO; 2 mM isoleucine), valine (VAL; 2 mM valine), and high BCAA (LIV; 2 mM leucine, 2 mM isoleucine, and 2 mM valine). BCAA was added to the culture medium 24 h before LPS stimulation. Our results indicated that BCAA supplementation did not impair cell viability. The amino acids leucine and isoleucine attenuated the synthesis of IL-8 and JNK and NF-kB phosphorylation induced by LPS. Furthermore, neither BCAA supplementation nor LPS treatment modulated the activity of glutathione peroxidase or the intracellular reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio. Therefore, leucine and isoleucine exert anti-inflammatory effects in Caco-2 cells exposed to LPS by modulating JNK and NF-kB phosphorylation and IL-8 production. Further in vivo studies are required to validate these findings and gather valuable information for potential therapeutic or dietary interventions."

However, the underlying mechanism remains uncertain. This study included 1302 subjects and followed for 4-5 years. A hyperbranched-chain aminoacidemia rat model was induced by high fructose diet (HFTD). The relationship between BCAAs and TG level and its regulatory mechanism was investigated in vitro. As results, as baseline BCAA percentile increased, subjects had higher prevalence and incidence of T2DM, NAFLD, and CVD risk (P < 0.05). In animal model, the accumulation of BCAAs and TG and betatrophin expression were significantly elevated in the HFTD group when comparing with those in the SD group(P < 0.05). Immunofluorescence and Masson's trichrome staining revealed that the area of interstitial fibrosis was significantly increased in the HFTD group compared with control group. Met treatment significantly decreased TG levels and betatrophin expression and reversed myocardial fibrosis (P < 0.05). In vitro, LO2 cells, stimulated with 0.1-5 mM BCAAs, displayed a significant dose-dependent increase in betatrophin expression (P < 0.05). And 5 mM BCAAs stimulation significantly increased the p-mTOR and SREBP-1 expression (P < 0.05). However, this effect could be reversed by using the corresponding inhibitor or siRNAs. In conclusions, BCAAs promote occurrence and development of cardiovascular disease dependent on TG metabolism via activation of the mTOR/SREBP-1/betatrophin pathway. The study provides a new theory for the pathogenesis of CVD caused by amino acid metabolism disorders.",

      "abstract": "The GG genotype of the Patatin-like phosphatase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3), dietary fat, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) are linked with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We studied the impact of the quality of dietary fat on plasma (p) and fecal (f) SCFA and p-BCAA in men homozygous for the PNPLA3 rs738409 variant (I148M). Eighty-eight randomly assigned men (age 67.8 ± 4.3 years, body mass index 27.1 ± 2.5 kg/m2) participated in a 12-week diet intervention. The recommended diet (RD) group followed the National and Nordic nutrition recommendations for fat intake. The average diet (AD) group followed the average fat intake in Finland. The intervention resulted in a decrease in total p-SCFAs and iso-butyric acid in the RD group (p = 0.041 and p = 0.002). Valeric acid (p-VA) increased in participants with the GG genotype regardless of the diet (RD, 3.6 ± 0.6 to 7.0 ± 0.6 µmol/g, p = 0.005 and AD, 3.8 ± 0.3 to 9.7 ± 8.5 µmol/g, p = 0.015). Also, genotype relation to p-VA was seen statistically significantly in the RD group (CC: 3.7 ± 0.4 to 4.2 ± 1.7 µmol/g and GG: 3.6 ± 0.6 to 7.0 ± 0.6 µmol/g, p = 0.0026 for time and p = 0.004 for time and genotype). P-VA, unlike any other SCFA, correlated positively with plasma gamma-glutamyl transferase (r = 0.240, p = 0.025). Total p-BCAAs concentration changed in the AD group comparing PNPLA3 CC and GG genotypes (CC: 612 ± 184 to 532 ± 149 µmol/g and GG: 587 ± 182 to 590 ± 130 µmol/g, p = 0.015 for time). Valine decreased in the RD group (p = 0.009), and leucine decreased in the AD group (p = 0.043). RD decreased total fecal SCFA, acetic acid (f-AA), and butyric acid (f-BA) in those with CC genotype (p = 0.006, 0.013 and 0.005, respectively). Our results suggest that the PNPLA3 genotype modifies the effect of dietary fat modification for p-VA, total f-SCFA, f-AA and f-BA, and total p-BCAA.",

An increasing number of clinical studies have demonstrated that high levels of circulating BCAAs are associated with an increased risk of CVDs.

Despite these insights, the causal relationship between BCAA metabolism and CVD remains poorly established, and the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood.

      "abstract": "In the global food industry, plant-based protein isolates are gaining prominence as an alternative to animal-based counterparts. However, their nutritional value often falters due to insufficient essential amino acids. To address this issue, our study introduces a sustainable protein isolate derived from yeast cells, achieved through high-pressure homogenization (HPH) and alkali pH-shifting treatment. Subjected to HPH pressures ranging from 60 to 120 MPa and 1 to 10 cycles, higher pressure and cycle numbers resulted in enhanced disruption of yeast cells. Combining HPH with alkali pH-shifting treatment significantly augmented protein extraction. Four cycles of HPH at 100 MPa yielded the optimized protein content, resulting in a yeast protein isolate (YPI) with 75.3 g protein per 100 g powder, including 30.0 g of essential amino acids and 18.4 g of branched-chain amino acids per 100 g protein. YPI exhibited superior water and oil-holding capacities compared to pea protein isolate, whey protein isolate (WPI), and soy protein isolate. Although YPI exhibited lower emulsifying ability than WPI, it excelled in stabilizing protein-stabilized emulsions. For foaming, YPI outperformed others in both foaming ability and stabilizing protein-based foam. In conclusion, YPI surpasses numerous plant-based protein alternatives in essential amino acids and branched-chain amino acids contents, positioning it as an excellent candidate for widespread utilization as a sustainable protein source in the food industry, owing to its exceptional nutritional advantages, as well as emulsifying and foaming properties. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study introduces a sustainable protein isolate derived from yeast cells. YPI exhibited considerable promise as a protein source. Nutritionally, YPI notably surpassed plant-based protein isolates in EAA and BCAA contents. Functionally, YPI demonstrated superior water-holding and oil-holding capacities, as well as an effective emulsion and foam stabilizer.",

Currently, there are no updated systematic reviews evaluating the efficacy of perioperative BCAA supplementation in patients undergoing surgery for liver cancer. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of perioperative BCAA supplementation in patients undergoing surgery for liver cancer. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized control trials and observational studies was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science to evaluate the effect of perioperative BCAA supplementation compared to standard in-hospital diet, in liver cancer patients undergoing surgery. Clinical outcomes were extracted, and a meta-analysis was performed on relevant outcomes. RESULTS: 16 studies including 1389 patients were included. Perioperative BCAA administration was associated with reduced postoperative infection [risk ratio (RR) = 0.58 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.39 to 0.84, P = 0.005] and ascites [RR = 0.57 (95%CI: 0.38 to 0.85), P = 0.005]. There was also a reduction in length of hospital stay (LOS) [weighted mean difference (WMD) = -3.03 d (95%CI: -5.49 to -0.57), P = 0.02] and increase in body weight [WMD = 1.98 kg (95%CI: 0.35 to 3.61, P = 0.02]. No significant differences were found in mortality, cancer recurrence and overall survival. No significant safety concerns were identified. CONCLUSION: Perioperative BCAA administration is efficacious in reducing postoperative infection, ascites, LOS, and increases body weight in liver cancer patients undergoing surgical resection."

Researchers are currently focusing their efforts on investigating the metabolism of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and amino acids to enhance the prognosis of cardiovascular diseases. Simultaneously, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), including leucine, isoleucine, and valine, play significant roles in blood glucose regulation, protein synthesis, and insulin sensitivity. However, disrupted BCAAs metabolism has been associated with conditions such as hypertension, obesity, and atherosclerosis. This article explores intricate metabolic pathways, unveiling the connection between disrupted BCAAs metabolism and the progression of heart failure. Furthermore, the article discusses therapeutic strategies, assesses the impact of BCAAs on cardiac dysfunction, and examines the potential of modulating BCAAs metabolism as a treatment for heart failure. BCAAs and their metabolites are also considered as biomarkers for evaluating cardiac metabolic risk. In conclusion, this article elucidates the multifaceted roles of BCAAs in heart failure and cardiovascular health, providing guidance for future research and intervention measures."

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) still holds the title as one of the most debilitating chronic diseases with rising prevalence and incidence, including its complications such as retinal, renal, and peripheral nerve disease. In order to develop novel molecules for diagnosis and treatment, a deep understanding of the complex molecular pathways is imperative. Currently, the existing agents for T2DM treatment target only blood glucose levels. Over the past decades, specific building blocks of proteins-branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) including leucine, isoleucine, and valine-have gained attention because they are linked with insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, and diabetes development. In this review, we discuss the hypothetical link between BCAA metabolism, insulin resistance, T2DM, and its microvascular complications including diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy. Further research on these amino acids and their derivates may eventually pave the way to novel biomarkers or therapeutic concepts for the treatment of diabetes and its accompanied complications."

      "abstract": "The benefits of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) administration after hepatic intervention in patients with liver diseases remain unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of BCAA on patients undergoing hepatectomy, trans-arterial embolisation and radiofrequency ablation. Relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT) were obtained from PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate the pooled effect size by using random-effects models. The primary outcomes were survival and tumour recurrence. The secondary outcomes were hospital stay, nutrition status, biochemistry profile, complication rate of liver treatment and adverse effect of BCAA supplementation. In total, eleven RCT involving 750 patients were included. Our meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the rates of tumour recurrence and overall survival between the BCAA and control groups. However, the pooled estimate showed that BCAA supplementation in patients undergoing hepatic intervention significantly increased serum albumin (mean difference (MD): 0·11 g/dl, 95 % CI: 0·02, 0·20; 5 RCT) at 6 months and cholinesterase level (MD: 50·00 U/L, 95 % CI: 21·08, 78·92; 1 RCT) at 12 months and reduced ascites incidence (risk ratio: 0·39, 95 % CI: 0·21, 0·71; 4 RCT) at 12 months compared with the control group. Additionally, BCAA administration significantly increased body weight at 6 months and 12 months and increased arm circumference at 12 months. In conclusion, BCAA supplementation significantly improved the liver function, reduced the incidence of ascites and increased body weight and arm circumference. Thus, BCAA supplementation may beneficial for selected patients undergoing liver intervention.",

      "abstract": "Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), including valine, leucine, and isoleucine, are crucial amino acids with significant implications in tumorigenesis across various human malignancies. Studies have demonstrated that altered BCAA metabolism can influence tumor growth and progression. Increased levels of BCAAs have been associated with tumor growth inhibition, indicating their potential as anti-cancer agents. Conversely, a deficiency in BCAAs can promote tumor metastasis to different organs due to the disruptive effects of high BCAA concentrations on tumor cell migration and invasion. This disruption is associated with tumor cell adhesion, angiogenesis, metastasis, and invasion. Furthermore, BCAAs serve as nitrogen donors, contributing to synthesizing macromolecules such as proteins and nucleotides crucial for cancer cell growth. Consequently, BCAAs exhibit a dual role in cancer, and their effects on tumor growth or inhibition are contingent upon various conditions and concentrations. This review discusses these contrasting findings, providing valuable insights into BCAA-related therapeutic interventions and ultimately contributing to a better understanding of their potential role in cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet production disorders are the main causes of thrombocythemia and thrombocytopenia and lead to thrombosis or hemorrhage. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are essential nutrients that regulate important metabolic signals. BCAA administration could also increase platelet activation and promote the risk of thrombosis. OBJECTIVES: To unveil the role of BCAAs in thrombocytopoiesis. METHODS: BCAA-fed mice and megakaryocyte/platelet-specific branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase E1α subunit-deficient mice were used to study the role of BCAAs in thrombocytopoiesis. RESULTS: In this study, we found that BCAA diet could facilitate megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet production. Meanwhile, megakaryocyte/platelet-specific branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase E1α subunit-deficient mice developed thrombocythemia, which was mainly caused by the excessive differentiation of megakaryocytes and proplatelet biogenesis. Moreover, the use of BT2, the agonist of BCAA catabolism, could affect proplatelet formation (PPF) and megakaryocyte polyploidization, as well as ameliorating the thrombocythemia of BCAA-fed mice. CONCLUSION: We found that deficiency in BCAA catabolism led to the activation of p70S6K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, megakaryocyte over differentiation, and the acceleration of PPF. Activating BCAA metabolism with BT2 could inhibit mTOR signaling, reduce PPF, and ameliorate thrombocythemia in BCAA-fed mice. Therefore, this study reveals a novel role of BCAAs in megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet production, suggesting that targeting BCAA-mediated p70S6K/mTOR signaling may be a potential strategy for the treatment of thrombocytopenia or thrombocythemia.",

This study investigated the effect of energy supplementation and the combination of anti-inflammatory factor (eicosapentaenoic acid; EPA) and muscle-synthesis promotor (branched-chain amino acids; BCAA) on body composition, muscle, and inflammatory biomarkers in elderly with inadequate protein intake. METHODS: A randomized blinded placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 84 elderly with inadequate protein intake. The participants were randomly assigned into four groups receiving a complete nutrition drink; (1) control formula, (2) fortified with 2.2 g EPA, (3) with 2.2 g EPA and 5 g BCAA (2:1:1 of Leu: Ile: Val), and (4) with 2.2 g EPA plus 5g BCAA (4:1:1 of Leu: Ile: Val). Each subject consumed two sachets of the drink to gain 500 kcal/day and performed arm muscle exercises for 3 weeks. Body compositions and handgrip strength were measured using BIA and a dynamometer, respectively. Plasma EPA and BCAA levels were determined using LC-MS/MS to ensure compliance. Muscle protein biomarkers including histidine, β-alanine, and carnosine were measured using LC-MS/MS. Serum inflammatory (IL-6) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) were measured by using ELISA. RESULTS: No symptoms and signs of adverse events were observed. The right arm muscle mass and handgrip strength were significantly increased after consuming a complete nutrition drink fortified with EPA + BCAA 2:1:1 and 4:1:1 of Leu: Ile: Val (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively. Consistently, consuming such combinatory formula non-significantly elevated carnosine with reduced histidine, and increased IL-10 with decreased IL-6. All relevant intervention groups showed a significant increase in plasma levels of BCAA and EPA. CONCLUSION: Consuming a complete nutrition drink fortified with 2.2g EPA and 5g BCAA 2:1:1 or 4:1:1 of Leu: Ile: Val for 3 weeks may increase right arm muscle mass and strength in elderly with inadequate protein intake. The tendency of increased dipeptide (carnosine)/decreased free amino acid (histidine) suggests a shift toward muscle protein synthesis. The trend of decreased inflammatory/increased anti-inflammatory cytokines suggests an anti-inflammatory effect. Future long-term studies are warranted to confirm the combinatory effect of BCAA and EPA in the prevention of sarcopenia.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cellular immunity as reflected by total lymphocyte count (TLC) has been proven to be related to overall survival rate cancer patients. Lymphocyte proliferation is regulated, to some extent, by nutritional factor. Branched chain amino acid (BCAA) is documented as one of numerous nutrients that play important role in lymphocyte proliferation through its effect on protein synthesis and DNA replication. Many studies describe the correlation between BCAA and TLC in hepatic cancer patients. This study emphasized the observation of that links in head and neck cancer patients. METHODS: Eighty-five subjects were included in final analysis, aged 18-75, mostly male, with head and neck cancer who had not received treatment participated in this cross-sectional study at the Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital's radiation and medical haematology oncology clinic. The BCAAs intake was assessed using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Flow cytometry method was used to quantify TLC. RESULTS: Overall, the subjects' nutritional status mostly was considered normal, with the median intake of 1505 (800-3040) kcal/day of energy and mean of 73.96 ± 23.39 g/day of protein. Moreover, subjects' average BCAA intake was 10.92 ± 0.48 g/day. Meanwhile, 17.6% of subjects were found to have low TLC level. From thorough analysis, we did not find a strong correlation between BCAA level and TLC (r = 0.235, p = 0.056). CONCLUSION: In participants with head and neck cancer who had not received chemoradiotherapy, there is no correlation between BCAA intake and TLC. The contribution of non-BCAA amino acids from dietary sources to lymphocyte proliferation requires further investigation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Retrospectively registered, with clinical trial number NCT05226065 on February 7th 2022."

Disruption of these systems has been associated with the pathophysiology of autism while low levels of these amino acids have been discovered in patients with autism. A pilot open-label, prospective, follow-up study of the use of BCAA in children with autistic behaviour was carried out. Fifty-five children between the ages of 6 and 18 participated in the study from May 2015 to May 2018. We used a carbohydrate-free BCAA-powdered mixture containing 45·5 g of leucine, 30 g of isoleucine and 24·5 g of valine in a daily dose of 0·4 g/kg of body weight which was administered every morning. Following the initiation of BCAA administration, children were submitted to a monthly psychological examination. Beyond the 4-week mark, BCAA were given to thirty-two people (58·18 %). Six of them (10·9 %) discontinued after 4-10 weeks owing to lack of improvement. The remaining twenty-six children (47·27 %) who took BCAA for longer than 10 weeks displayed improved social behaviour and interactions, as well as improvements in their speech, cooperation, stereotypy and, principally, their hyperactivity. There were no adverse reactions reported during the course of the treatment. Although these data are preliminary, there is some evidence that BCAA could be used as adjunctive treatment to conventional therapeutic methods for the management of autism.",

      "abstract": "Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) can be critically involved in skeletal muscle growth and body energy homeostasis. Skeletal muscle growth is a complex process; some muscle-specific microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the regulation of muscle thickening and muscle mass. Additionally, the regulatory network between miRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) in the modulation of the role of BCAAs on skeletal muscle growth in fish has not been studied. In this study, common carp was starved for 14 days, followed by a 14-day gavage therapy with BCAAs, to investigate some of the miRNAs and genes that contribute to the regulation of normal growth and maintenance of skeletal muscle in response to short-term BCAA starvation stress. Subsequently, the transcriptome and small RNAome sequencing of carp skeletal muscle were performed. A total of 43,414 known and 1,112 novel genes were identified, in addition to 142 known and 654 novel miRNAs targeting 22,008 and 33,824 targets, respectively. Based on their expression profiles, 2,146 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 84 differentially expressed miRNA (DEMs) were evaluated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathways, including the proteasome, phagosome, autophagy in animals, proteasome activator complex, and ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process, were enriched for these DEGs and DEMs. Our findings revealed the role of atg5, map1lc3c, ctsl, cdc53, psma6, psme2, myl9, and mylk in skeletal muscle growth, protein synthesis, and catabolic metabolism. Furthermore, miR-135c, miR-192, miR-194, and miR-203a may play key roles in maintaining the normal activities of the organism by regulating genes related to muscle growth, protein synthesis, and catabolism. This study on transcriptome and miRNA reveals the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of muscle protein deposition and provides new insights into genetic engineering techniques to improve common carp muscle development."

Here, we evaluated the efficacy of 16 weeks branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) supplementation on frailty in frail compensated cirrhotic patients. METHODS: After a 4-week run-in period consisted of dietary and exercise counseling, compensated cirrhotic patients with frailty, defined by liver frailty index (LFI)≥4.5, were randomly assigned (1:1) to BCAA or control group. The BCAA group received twice daily BCAAs supplementation (210 kcal, protein 13.5 g, BCAA 2.03 g) for 16 weeks. The primary outcome was frailty reversion. The secondary outcomes were changes in biochemistries, body composition evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis, and quality of life (QoL). RESULTS: 54 patients were prospectively enrolled (age 65.5 ± 9.9 years, 51.9% female, Child-Pugh A/B 68.5%/31.5%, MELD 10.3 ± 3.1). Baseline characteristics were similar between both groups. At week 16, BCAA group had a significant improvement in LFI (-0.36 ± 0.3 vs. -0.15 ± 0.28, P = 0.01), BMI (+ 0.51 ± 1.19 vs. -0.49 ± 1.89 kg/m2, P = 0.03), and serum albumin (+ 0.26 ± 0.27 vs. +0.06 ± 0.3 g/dl, P = 0.01). The proportion of frailty reversion at week 16 was significantly higher in BCAA group (36% vs. 0%, P < 0.001). Compared with baseline, BCAA group had a significant increase in skeletal muscle index (7.5 ± 1.6 to 7.8 ± 1.5 kg/m2, P = 0.03). Regarding the QoL, only the BCAA group had a significant improvement in all 4 domains of physical component score of the SF-36 questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: A 16-week BCAA supplementation improved frailty in frail compensated cirrhotic patients. In addition, this intervention resulted in an improvement of muscle mass and physical domain of QoL in these patients.

We aimed to determine whether long-term dietary intake of BCAA is associated with liver-related mortality in a well-characterized cohort of North American patients with advanced fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis. We performed a retrospective cohort study using extended follow-up data from the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) Trial. The analysis included 656 patients who completed two Food Frequency Questionnaires. The primary exposure was BCAA intake measured in grams (g) per 1000 kilocalories (kcal) of energy intake (range 3.0-34.8 g/1000 kcal). During a median follow-up of 5.0 years, the incidence of liver-related death or transplantation was not significantly different among the four quartiles of BCAA intake before and after adjustment of confounders (AHR 1.02, 95% CI 0.81-1.27, P-value for trend = 0.89). There remains no association when BCAA was modeled as a ratio of BCAA to total protein intake or as absolute BCAA intake. Finally, BCAA intake was not associated with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, encephalopathy or clinical hepatic decompensation. We concluded that dietary BCAA intake was not associated with liver-related outcomes in HCV-infected patients with advanced fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis. The precise effect of BCAA in patients with liver disease warrants further study.",

Studies have shown that the elevated level of branched chain amino acids is closely related to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. It can affect insulin signal transduction by activating mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal pathway, and regulate insulin resistance by damaging lipid metabolism and affecting mitochondrial function. In addition, abnormal catabolism of branched amino acids can lead to the accumulation of metabolic intermediates, such as branched chain α-keto acids, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate and β-aminoisobutyric acid. Branched chain α-keto acids and 3-hydroxyisobutyrate can induce insulin resistance by affecting insulin signaling pathway and damaging lipid metabolism. β-aminoisobutyric acid can improve insulin resistance by reducing lipid accumulation and inflammatory reaction and enhancing fatty acid oxidation. This paper systematically reviewed the regulatory effects and mechanisms of branched chain amino acids and their metabolic intermediates on insulin resistance, which will provide a new direction for the prevention and treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Perylenequinones from Shiraia fruiting bodies are excellent photosensitizers and widely used for anti-cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). The lower yield of Shiraia perylenequinones becomes a significant bottleneck for their medical application. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) not only serve as important precursors for protein synthesis, but also are involved in signaling pathway in cell growth and development. However, there are few reports concerning their regulation of fungal secondary metabolism. In present study, the eliciting effects of BCAAs including L-isoleucine (L-Ile), L-leucine (L-Leu) and L-valine (L-Val) on Shiraia perylenequinone production were investigated. RESULTS: Based on the analysis of the transcriptome and amino acid contents of Shiraia in the production medium, we revealed the involvement of BCAAs in perylenequinone biosynthesis. The fungal conidiation was promoted by L-Val treatment at 1.5 g/L, but inhibited by L-Leu. The spore germination was promoted by both. The production of fungal perylenequinones including hypocrellins A (HA), HC and elsinochromes A-C (EA-EC) was stimulated significantly by L-Val at 1.5 g/L, but sharply suppressed by L-Leu. After L-Val treatment (1.5 g/L) in Shiraia mycelium cultures, HA, one of the main bioactive perylenequinones reached highest production 237.92 mg/L, about 2.12-fold than that of the control. Simultaneously, we found that the expression levels of key genes involved in the central carbon metabolism and in the late steps for perylenequinone biosynthesis were up-regulated significantly by L-Val, but most of them were down-regulated by L-Leu. CONCLUSIONS: Our transcriptome analysis demonstrated that BCAA metabolism was involved in Shiraia perylenequinone biosynthesis. Exogenous BCAAs exhibit contrasting effects on Shiraia growth and perylenequinones production. L-Val could promote perylenequinone biosynthesis via not only enhancing the central carbon metabolism for more precursors, but also eliciting perylenequinone biosynthetic gene expressions. This is the first report on the regulation of BCAAs on fungal perylenequinone production. These findings provided a basis for understanding physiological roles of BCAAs and a new avenue for increasing perylenequinone production in Shiraia mycelium cultures.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Adequate nutrition is essential to address the surgical stress response and mitigate loss of muscle mass, strength, and functionality in older adults with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). However, it is unknown whether amino acids and/or vitamin D are beneficial in older adults following lumbar surgery for LSS. PURPOSE: To evaluate whether branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) plus vitamin D supplementation could attenuate the loss of muscle mass and strength, accelerate the return of functional mobility, and improve clinical outcomes following lumbar surgery for LSS. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A single-center, single-blind randomized controlled trial. PATIENT SAMPLE: Eighty patients who received lumbar surgery for LSS. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the Zurich claudication questionnaire (ZCQ), and secondary outcomes included knee muscle strength, muscle mass measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis, gait speed and a timed up-and-go test (TUG) at 12 weeks postoperatively. Follow-up assessment was performed for the ZCQ at 52 weeks postoperatively. METHODS: Patients ingested the supplementation (BCAA group: BCAA plus vitamin D, Nonamino acid group: nonamino acid) twice daily for 3 weeks from the day after surgery, and received two hours of postoperative inpatient rehabilitation 5 times a week. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in the mean changes on the ZCQ between the two groups at 12 weeks and 52 weeks. At 2 weeks postoperatively, the nonamino acid group showed significant deterioration compared with the BCAA group for strengths of knee extensor and knee flexor (p < .01). At 12 weeks, the BCAA group showed significant improvements in knee extensor strength and knee flexor strength compared with the nonamino acid group (p <.01). There were no significant differences in mean changes of muscle mass, maximum gait speed, and TUG at 12 weeks between two groups. CONCLUSIONS: BCAA plus vitamin D supplementation did not improve LSS-related clinical outcomes after lumbar surgery for LSS, even though muscle strength increased. Future studies should focus on long-term outcomes for muscle mass and physical function, including development of sarcopenia and frailty.",

Herein, we report that accumulation of BCAAs in CD8+ T cells due to the impairment of BCAA degradation in 2C-type serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP2Cm)-deficient mice leads to hyper-activity of CD8+ T cells and enhanced anti-tumor immunity. CD8+ T cells from PP2Cm-/- mice upregulate glucose transporter Glut1 expression in a FoxO1-dependent manner with more glucose uptake, as well as increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, BCAA supplementation recapitulates CD8+ T cell hyper-functions and synergizes with anti-PD-1, in line with a better prognosis in NSCLC patients containing high BCAAs when receiving anti-PD-1 therapy. Our finding thus reveals that accumulation of BCAAs promotes effector function and anti-tumor immunity of CD8+ T cells through reprogramming glucose metabolism, making BCAAs alternative supplementary components to increase the clinical efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy against tumors.",

Whether the preventive effects are related with metabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) is unclear. The study aims to evaluate the effects of germinated brown rice (GBR) intervention on BCAAs metabolism in T2DM patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this randomized controlled trial, subjects with T2DM are instructed to consume 100 g day-1 GBR (GBR group, n=42) or equal staple food (Control group, n=25) for 3 months. Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) and serum samples are collected before and after the intervention. In the GBR group, fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS), and serum BCAAs are decreased, and islet function is improved (p<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that FBG (odds ratios [OR]: 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.84) and energy (OR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09-1.30) are positively associated with serum total BCAAs level, while FINS is negatively associated (OR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.04-0.88). Simultaneously, the key enzymes of BCAAs decomposition, which promotes glycolysis by activating pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), are significantly increased. CONCLUSION: GBR improves the indicators of T2DM patients, and the underlying mechanisms include improving insulin resistance and accelerating catabolism of BCAAs.",

In addition, lower plasma BCAA levels have been related to an increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy in liver cirrhosis. In this article we will review the role of supplementation with BCAAs and BCAA derivative β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) in liver cirrhosis, focusing on nutritional and clinical effects. Evidence shows that BCAA supplementation slightly increases muscle mass and body mass index, with an upward trend in muscular strength and no change in fat mass. Moreover, BCAA supplementation improves symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy, and is indicated as second-line therapy. The evidence is more limited for BCAA derivatives. HMB supplementation appears to increase muscle mass in chronic diseases associated with cachexia, although this effect has not yet been clearly demonstrated in liver cirrhosis studies. To date, HMB supplementation has no clinical indication in liver cirrhosis."

However, there is currently no effective treatment targeting fibrogenesis. Recently, metabolic alterations are increasingly considered as essential factors underlying fibrogenesis, and especially research on metabolic regulation of amino acids is flourishing. Among them, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are the most abundant essential amino acids, including leucine, isoleucine and valine, which play significant roles in the substance and energy metabolism and their regulation. Dysregulation of BCAAs metabolism has been proven to contribute to numerous diseases. In this review, we summarize the metabolic regulation of fibrosis and the changes in BCAAs metabolism secondary to fibrosis. We also review the effects and mechanisms of the BCAAs intervention, and its therapeutic targeting in hepatic, renal and cardiac fibrosis, with a focus on the fibrosis in liver and associated hepatocellular carcinoma.",

Clinical outcomes are negatively correlated to postoperative insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, indicating a novel treatment for reducing postoperative insulin resistance is urgently needed. The current work aimed to assess the protective effects of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) on glucose metabolism disorders induced surgically in a rat model, and to explore the underpinning mechanism. METHODS AND RESULTS: Rats were randomly assigned to 2 groups, including the control and BCAA groups. Rats were given a compulsory oral 3 mL load by gavage two hours before surgery. The results showed that BCAA remarkably reduced glycemia by suppressing liver gluconeogenesis via reduction of cAMP-response element-binding protein-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) gene and protein expression levels (all Ps < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that BCAA lower blood glucose levels by reducing liver gluconeogenesis without significant elevation of plasma insulin levels. We anticipate that preoperative BCAA supplementation may be a means for preventing postoperative insulin resistance."

Overfeeding was shown to rapidly induce weight gain and fat mass, associated with mild insulin resistance in humans, and thus represents a suitable model of the metabolic complications resulting from obesity. We studied the effects of a polyphenol-rich grape extract supplementation on the plasma metabolome during an overfeeding intervention in adults, in two randomized parallel controlled clinical trials. METHODS: Blood plasma samples from 40 normal weight to overweight male adults, submitted to a 31-day overfeeding (additional 50% of energy requirement by a high calorie-high fructose diet), given either 2 g/day grape polyphenol extract or a placebo at 0, 15, 21, and 31 days were analyzed (Lyon study). Samples from a similarly designed trial on females (20 subjects) were collected in parallel (Lausanne study). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics was conducted to characterize metabolome changes induced by overfeeding and associated effects from polyphenol supplementation. The clinical trials are registered under the numbers NCT02145780 and NCT02225457 at ClinicalTrials.gov. RESULTS: Changes in plasma levels of many metabolic markers, including branched chain amino acids (BCAA), ketone bodies and glucose in both placebo as well as upon polyphenol intervention were identified in the Lyon study. Polyphenol supplementation counterbalanced levels of BCAA found to be induced by overfeeding. These results were further corroborated in the Lausanne female study. CONCLUSION: Administration of grape polyphenol-rich extract over 1 month period was associated with a protective metabolic effect against overfeeding in adults."

      "abstract": "As an internal time-keeping mechanism, circadian rhythm plays crucial role in maintaining homoeostasis when in response to nutrition change; meanwhile, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) in skeletal muscle play an important role in preserving energy homoeostasis during fasting. Previous results from our laboratory suggested that fasting can influence peripheral circadian rhythm and BCAA metabolism in fish, but the relationship between circadian rhythm and BCAA metabolism, and whether circadian rhythm regulates BCAA metabolism to maintain physiological homoeostasis during fasting remains unclear. This study shows that the expression of fifteen core clock genes as well as KLF15 and Bcat2 is highly responsive to short-term fasting in fast muscle of Siniperca chuatsi, and the correlation coefficient between Clock and KLF15 expression is enhanced after fasting treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the transcriptional expression of KLF15 is regulated by Clock, and the transcriptional expression of Bcat2 is regulated by KLF15 by using dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and Vivo-morpholinos-mediated gene knockdown technique. Therefore, fasting imposes a dynamic coordination of transcription between the circadian rhythm and BCAA metabolic pathways. The findings highlight the interaction between circadian rhythm and BCAA metabolism and suggest that fasting induces a switch in KLF15 expression through affecting the rhythmic expression of Clock, and then KLF15 promotes the transcription of Bcat2 to enhance the metabolism of BCAA, thus maintaining energy homoeostasis and providing energy for skeletal muscle as well as other tissues.",

Here, we evaluated the effects of 6-weeks very-low calorie diet (VLCD) upon fasting BCAA in overweight (OW) non-diabetic men, to explore associations between circulating BCAA and IR, before and after a weight loss intervention. Fasting plasma BCAAs were quantified in an OW (n = 26; BMI 32.4 ± 3 kg/m2; mean age 44 ± 9 y) and a normal-weight (NW) group (n = 26; BMI 24 ± 3.1 kg/m2; mean age 32 ± 12.3 y). Ten of the OW group (BMI 32.2 ± 4 kg/m2; 46 ± 8 y) then underwent 6-weeks of VLCD (600-800 kcal/day). Fasting plasma BCAA (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry), insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR) and body-composition (DXA) were assessed before and after VLCD. Total BCAA were higher in OW individuals (sum leucine/isoleucine/valine: 457 ± 85 µM) compared to NW control individuals (365 ± 78 µM, p < 0.001). Despite significant weight loss (baseline 103.9 ± 12.3 to 93 ± 9.6 kg and BMI 32.2 ± 4 to 28.9 ± 3.6 kg/m2), no changes were observed in BCAAs after 6-weeks of VLCD. Moreover, although VLCD resulted in a significant reduction in HOMA-IR (baseline 1.19 ± 0.62 to 0.51 ± 0.21 post-VLCD; p < 0.001), Pearson's r revealed no relationships between BCAA and HOMA-IR, either before (leucine R2: 2.49e-005, p = 0.98; isoleucine R2: 1.211-e006, p = 0.9; valine R2: 0.004, p = 0.85) or after VLCD (leucine R2: 0.003, p = 0.86; isoleucine R2: 0.006, p = 0.82; valine R2: 0.002, p = 0.65). Plasma BCAA are higher in OW compared to NW individuals. However, while 6-weeks VLCD reduced body weight and IR in OW individuals, this was not associated with reductions in BCAA. This suggests that studies demonstrating links between BCAA and insulin resistance in OW individuals, are complex and are not normalised by simply losing weight.",

Despite the recommendation of BCAAs in some guidelines, adverse effects have been reported in studies so the efficacy and safety of BCAAs remain controversial. Currently, BCAAs have been widely used in chronic liver disease, while the summary of the effect of BCAAs on long-term prognosis is rare. AIM: To determine the effects of BCAAs in patients with LC. METHODS: The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched. The retrieval deadline was 1 October 2021 and there were no language restrictions set in the retrieval. The study was performed in strict accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Nine studies were finally included. The primary outcome was complications of LC. The secondary outcomes were nutritional status and liver function. This meta-analysis used the Review Manager, version 5 statistical package (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, England) for analysis. RESULTS: The analysis included nine studies that consisted of 1080 patients (554 in the BCAA groups and 526 in the control groups). The nine studies were randomized control trials (RCTs). The quality of the studies was assessed using the risk of bias method recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. BCAAs reduced the rate of complications in LC patients [Risk ratio: 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56-0.88, P = 0.002] and improved patients' albumin levels [std mean difference SMD: 0.26, 95%CI: 0.12-0.40, P = 0.0002]. Meanwhile, BCAAs significantly ameliorated the levels of alanine transaminase (SMD: -2.03, 95%CI: -2.52 to -1.53, P < 0.00001) and aspartate aminotransferase (SMD: -1.8, 95%CI: -2.14 to -1.46, P < 0.00001). Meanwhile, glucose in the LC was significantly increased in BCAA-treated patients (MD: 13.04, 95%CI: 6.81-19.89, P = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: BCAAs reduce the incidence of complications in patients with LC and ameliorate nutritional status."

      "abstract": "Neuroinflammation caused by the disorder of gut microbiota and its metabolites is associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Thus, it is necessary to identify certain molecules derived from gut microbiota to verify whether they could become intervention targets for the treatment of PD. The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), as a common dietary supplement, could modulate brain function. Herein, we investigated the longitudinal shifts of microbial community in mice treated with rotenone for 0, 3 and 4 weeks by 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify the microbial markers at different PD stages. Serum BCAAs were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Then, rotenone-induced mice were given a high BCAA diet to evaluate the motor and non-motor functions, dopaminergic neuron loss, and inflammation levels. Using a PD mouse model, we discovered that during PD progression, the alterations of gut microbiota compositions led to the peripheral decrease of BCAAs. Based on the serum lipopolysaccharide binding protein concentrations and the levels of pro-inflammatory factors (including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin [IL]-1β, and IL-6) in the colon and substantia nigra, we found that the high BCAA diet could attenuate the inflammatory levels in PD mice, and reverse motor and non-motor dysfunctions and dopaminergic neuron impairment. Together, our results emphasize the dynamic changes of gut microbiota and BCAA metabolism and propose a novel strategy for PD therapy: a high BCAA diet intervention could improve PD progression by regulating the levels of inflammation.",

Both BCAAs and its metabolites are involved in various processes such as protein anabolism and catabolism, energy supply, signaling transduction and so on. Previous studies have observed the widely alternations of BCAAs and its related proteins in multiple tumor phenotypes, which suggests that BCAAs metabolic disorders may have emerged as a powerful factor for tumor metabolism reprogramming. BCAAs metabolism has a pivotal role in tumorigenesis and progression, including cell growth, proliferation, migration, invasion, and so on. In this review, we try to shed light on the crucial role of BCAAs metabolic disorders in different tumor types by focusing on the impacts of metabolic disorders of BCAAs and discussing the notable proteins involved in cancer metabolic reprogramming of BCAAs, such as BCAT1/2, BCKDH-BCKDK-PPM1K complex, transporters of BCAAs and its metabolites, transcription factors and so on, and present several possible diagnose approaches and therapies to BCAAs-related cancers.",

High levels of BCAAs in circulation are considered as potential markers of metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) in humans. However, there are conflicting reports about the effects of supplement of BCAAs on MAFLD, and research on BCAAs and gut microbiota is not comprehensive. Here, C57BL/6J mice were fed with a high-fat diet with or without BCAAs to elucidate the effects of BCAAs on the gut microbiota and metabolic functions in a mouse model of MAFLD. Compared to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, BCAA supplementation significantly reduced the mouse body weight, ratio of liver/body weight, hepatic lipid accumulation, serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and the expressions of the lipogenesis-related enzymes Fas, Acc, and Scd-1 and increased expressions of the lipolysis-related enzymes Cpt1A and Atgl in the liver. BCAAs supplementation also counteracted HFD-induced elevations in serum BCAAs levels by stimulating the enzymatic activity of BCKDH. Furthermore, BCAAs supplementation markedly improved the gut bacterial diversity and altered the gut microbiota composition and abundances, especially those of genera, in association with MAFLD and BCAAs metabolism. These data suggest that BCAA treatment improves HFD-induced MAFLD through mechanisms involving intestinal microbes."

OBJECTIVE: We examined to what extent lifestyle intervention aiming to prevent T2D interacts with this association and how BCAA concentrations change during the intervention. METHODS: We computed trajectory clusters by k-means clustering of serum fasting BCAAs analyzed annually by mass spectrometry during a 4-year intervention. We investigated whether baseline BCAAs, BCAA trajectories, and BCAA change trajectories predicted T2D and whether BCAAs predicted T2D differently in the intervention (n = 198) and control group (n = 196). RESULTS: Elevated baseline BCAAs predicted the incidence of T2D in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05 per 10 μmol/L, P = 0.01), but not in the intervention group. BCAA concentration decreased during the first year in the whole cohort (mean -14.9 μmol/L, P < 0.001), with no significant difference between the groups. We identified 5 BCAA trajectory clusters and 5 trajectory clusters for the change in BCAAs. Trajectories with high mean BCAA levels were associated with an increased HR for T2D compared with the trajectory with low BCAA levels (trajectory with highest vs lowest BCAA, HR 4.0; P = 0.01). A trajectory with increasing BCAA levels had a higher HR for T2D compared with decreasing trajectory in the intervention group only (HR 25.4, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Lifestyle intervention modified the association of the baseline BCAA concentration and BCAA trajectories with the incidence of T2D. Our study adds to the accumulating evidence on the mechanisms behind the effect of lifestyle changes on the risk of T2D.",

      "abstract": "Immunometabolism has been the focus of extensive research over the last years, especially in terms of augmenting anti-tumor immune responses. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a subset of CD4+ T cells, which have been known for their immunosuppressive roles in various conditions including anti-tumor immune responses. Even though several studies aimed to target Tregs in the tumor microenvironment (TME), such approaches generally result in the inhibition of the Tregs non-specifically, which may cause immunopathologies such as autoimmunity. Therefore, specifically targeting the Tregs in the TME would be vital in terms of achieving a successful and specific treatment. Recently, an association between Tregs and isoleucine, which represents one type of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), has been demonstrated. The presence of isoleucine seems to affect majorly Tregs, rather than conventional T cells. Considering the fact that Tregs bear several distinct metabolic features in the TME, targeting their immunometabolic pathways may be a rational approach. In this Review, we provide a general overview on the potential distinct metabolic features of T cells, especially focusing on BCAAs in Tregs as well as in their subtypes.",

      "abstract": "Empagliflozin (EMPA) is the first sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor to significantly reduce cardiovascular and kidney complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Given this, we speculate that EMPA may have the potential to intervene in diabetic retinopathy (DR), which is another diabetes-specific microvascular complication. Db/db mice were treated with EMPA for different periods to observe the retinas and related mechanisms. EMPA effectively balanced body weight and blood glucose levels, mitigated ocular edema and microaneurysm in db/db mice. EMPA significantly inhibited oxidative stress, apoptosis and recovered tight junction in diabetic retinas. MS/MS analyses showed that EMPA suppressed aberrant branched-chain amino acid (BCAAs) accumulation in db/db retinas, which led to the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin activation, downregulation of inflammation, and angiogenic factors, including TNF-ɑ, IL-6, VCAM-1, and VEGF induced by diabetes. Furthermore, branched-chain α-keto acids (BCKAs), which are catabolites of BCAAs, were increased in diabetic retinas and decreased with EMPA application. Moreover, branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK) was enhanced, BCKDHA and BCKDHB were decreased in diabetic retinas. This could be reversed by EMPA treatment, thus promoting BCAAs catabolism to decrease BCAAs and BCKAs accumulation in diabetic retinas. The high levels of BCAAs in the plasma and enhanced L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) were responsible for the high levels of BCAAs in diabetic retinas, which could be inhibited by EMPA. Overall, EMPA could ameliorate DR manifestations. The normalization of BCAAs catabolism and intake may play a role in this process. This study supports EMPA as a protective drug against DR.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endurance exercise training promotes the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in skeletal muscles. We have previously shown that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups J and K are markers of low responders in endurance training. In this paper, we hypothesize that BCAA catabolism is a surrogate marker of lower respiratory chain activity attributed to these haplogroups. We evaluated whether exercise-induced changes in amino acid concentrations differ between subjects harbouring mtDNA haplogroups J or K and those with non-JK haplogroups. METHODS: Finnish male conscripts (N = 633) undertook the 12-min Cooper running test at the beginning and end of their military service. The intervention during the service mainly included endurance aerobic exercise and sports-related muscle training. Concentrations of seven amino acids were analysed in the serum using a high-throughput 1H NMR metabolomics platform. Total DNA was extracted from whole blood, and restriction fragment analysis was used to determine mtDNA haplogroups J and K. RESULTS: The concentrations of the seven amino acids were higher following the intervention, with the exception of phenylalanine; interestingly, the increase in the concentrations of three BCAAs was larger in subjects with haplogroup J or K than in subjects with non-JK haplogroups (p = 0.029). MtDNA haplogroups J and K share two common nonsynonymous variants. Structural analysis based on crystallographic data on bovine complexes I and III revealed that the Leu18 variant in cytochrome b encoded by m.14798T > C may interfere with ubiquinone binding at the Qi site in complex III. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in the concentrations of serum BCAAs following exercise intervention differs between subjects harbouring mtDNA haplogroup J or K and those harbouring non-JK haplogroups. Lower response in endurance training and difference in exercise-induced increase in the concentrations of serum BCAAs suggest decreased respiratory chain activity. Haplogroups J and K share m.14798T > C in MT-CYB, which may hamper the function of complex III."

Our prior preclinical work demonstrated dietary supplementation with branched chain amino acids (BCAA: leucine, isoleucine, and valine), precursors to de novo glutamate production, restored impairments in glutamate, orexin/hypocretin neurons, sleep, and memory in rodent models of TBI. This pilot study assessed the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of dietary supplementation with BCAA on sleep and cognition in Veterans with TBI. METHODS: Thirty-two Veterans with TBI were prospectively enrolled in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial comparing BCAA (30 g, b.i.d. for 21-days) with one of two placebo arms (microcrystalline cellulose or rice protein, both 30 g, b.i.d. for 21-days). Pre- and post-intervention outcomes included sleep measures (questionnaires, daily sleep/study diaries, and wrist actigraphy), neuropsychological testing, and blood-based biomarkers related to BCAA consumption. RESULTS: Six subjects withdrew from the study (2/group), leaving 26 remaining subjects who were highly adherent to the protocol (BCAA, 93%; rice protein, 96%; microcrystalline, 95%; actigraphy 87%). BCAA were well-tolerated with few side effects and no adverse events. BCAA significantly improved subjective insomnia symptoms and objective sleep latency and wake after sleep onset on actigraphy. CONCLUSION: Dietary supplementation with BCAA is a mechanism-based, promising intervention that shows feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy to treat insomnia and objective sleep disruption in Veterans with TBI. A larger scale randomized clinical trial is warranted to further evaluate the efficacy, dosing, and duration of BCAA effects on sleep and other related outcome measures in individuals with TBI.

Current results in the light of BCAAs' biochemical properties make them an attractive supplementation option, in addition to standard pharmaceutical treatment of cirrhosis. AIM: The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the current literature and assess the efficacy of BCAA supplementation in patients with liver cirrhosis. METHODS: Major electronic databases and grey literature sources were searched up to October 4th, 2021 for RCTs assessing the supplementation of BCAA against an active comparator, diet or placebo in patients with liver cirrhosis. RESULTS: Twenty RCTs fulfilled selection criteria. Relative to other interventions BCAAs showed beneficial effect regarding muscle mass (SMD 0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.4, I2 0%), but no effect regarding fat mass. Furthermore, BCAAs were associated with significant increase in plasma albumin concentration (SMD 0.52, CI 95% 0.18 to 0.86, I2 84.99%), reduction in occurrence of serious cirrhotic complications (logOR -046, CI 95% -0.78 to -0.13, I2 0%) and increase in body mass index (WMD 0.24, CI 95% 0.08 to 0.40, I2 0%). On the other hand, no significant effect was noted concerning the incidence of mortality. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with BCAA seems to improve significant prognostic factors for patients with cirrhosis, with potential positive impact in mortality. Heterogeneity of study findings attributed to many factors limit overall conclusion and results require further assessment.",

AIMS: To evaluate the role of BCAA in improving muscle mass in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in patients with cirrhosis having sarcopenia. METHODS: Consecutive patients with cirrhosis with Child-Pugh score < 10 and sarcopenia were randomized to receive either 12 g/day of BCAA orally or a placebo (1:1) for 6 months in addition to a home-based exercise program (30 min/day), dietary counselling and standard medical therapy. Sarcopenia was defined according to gender-specific axial skeletal muscle index (SMI) cut-offs. The primary endpoint was a change in muscle mass based on CT scan (SMI) after 6 months of supplementation. RESULTS: Sixty patients [mean age 41.6 ± 9.9 years; males (66.6%) of predominantly viral (40%) and alcohol-related (31.7%) cirrhosis] were randomized. Baseline clinical and demographic characters were similar except MELD score (10.2 ± 2.8 vs. 12.2 ± 3.5, p = 0.02) and calorie intake (1838.1 kcal ± 631.5 vs. 2217.5 kcal ± 707.3, p = 0.03), both being higher in the placebo arm. After adjusting for both baseline confounders, baseline SMI and protein intake, the change in SMI at 6 months was similar in both groups [mean adjusted difference (MAD) + 0.84, CI - 2.9; + 1.2, p = 0.42] by intention-to-treat analysis. The secondary outcomes including change in handgrip strength (p = 0.65), 6-m gait speed (p = 0.20), 6-min walk distance (p = 0.39) were similar in both arms. Four patients had minor adverse events in each arm. CONCLUSION: Addition of BCAA to exercise, dietary counselling and standard medical therapy did not improve muscle mass in patients with cirrhosis having sarcopenia. (CTRI/2019/05/019269).

BCAA supplementation is primarily used as a beneficial nutritional intervention in chronic liver and kidney disease as well as in muscle wasting disorders. However, downregulated/upregulated plasma BCAAs and their defective catabolism in various tissues, mainly due to altered enzymatic activity of the first two enzymes in their catabolic pathway, BCAA aminotransferase (BCAT) and branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD), have been investigated in many nutritional and disease states. The current review focused on the underlying mechanisms of altered BCAA catabolism and its contribution to the pathogenesis of a numerous pathological conditions such as diabetes, heart failure and cancer. In addition, we summarize findings that indicate that the recovery of the dysregulated BCAA catabolism may be associated with an improved outcome and the prevention of serious disease complications.",

METHODS: Treatment naïve adults with PM/DM were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind trial to receive either TK-98 (drug name of BCAAs) or placebo in addition to conventional treatment. After 12 weeks, patients with an average manual muscle test (MMT) score &lt;9.5 were enrolled in an open label extension study for a further 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change of the MMT score at 12 weeks. The secondary endpoints were the clinical response and the change of functional index (FI). RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were randomized either to the TK-98 (n = 24) or placebo (n = 23) group. The changes of MMT scores at 12 weeks were 0.70 (0.19) [mean (s.e.m.)] and 0.69 (0.18), respectively (P = 0.98). Thirteen patients from the TK-98 group and 12 from the placebo group were enrolled in the extension study. The MMT scores in both groups improved similarly. The increase of the FI scores of the shoulder flexion at 12 weeks was significantly greater in the TK-98 group [27.9 (5.67) vs 12.8 (5.67) for the right shoulder flexion, and 27.0 (5.44) vs 13.4 (5.95) for the left shoulder; P &lt; 0.05]. Frequencies of adverse events up to 12 weeks were similar. CONCLUSION: BCAAs showed no effect on the improvement of the muscle strength evaluated by MMT and the clinical response.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) supplementation on several parameters used to assess sarcopenia in LC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive systematic electronic search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases using predefined keywords. We included full articles that satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality assessment of included studies was conducted using Cochrane Collaboration's tool and NHLBI quality assessment tools for interventional and observational studies, respectively. The principal summary outcome was the mean difference (MD) in the evaluated parameters. We performed a pre- and post-intervention analysis and comparison between two intervention groups (BCAA vs. controls) of the evaluated parameters when applicable. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies involving 1,225 subjects were included in our qualitative synthesis and five in our quantitative synthesis. At baseline vs. post-intervention assessment, subjects receiving BCAA supplementation were found to have a significant improvement in skeletal muscle index (SMI) (-0.347 [95% CI -0.628-0.067; p-value 0.015]) and mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC) (-1.273 [95% CI (-2.251-0.294; p-value 0.011]). However, no improvements were reported in handgrip (-0.616 [95% CI -2.818-1.586; p-value 0.584]) and triceps subcutaneous fat (1.10 [95% CI -0.814-3.014; p-value 0.263]). CONCLUSION: Following BCAA supplementation, several parameters used to evaluate sarcopenia in LC patients were found to be improved, including SMI and MAMC. Nevertheless, no improvements were seen in handgrip and triceps subcutaneous fat. Results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited methodological quality of the included studies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pork is an important food for humans and improving the quality of pork is closely related to human health. This study was designed to investigate the effects of balanced branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-supplemented protein-restricted diets on meat quality, muscle fiber types, and intramuscular fat (IMF) in finishing pigs. RESULTS: The results showed that, compared with the normal protein diet (160 g kg-1 crude protein), the reduced-protein diet (120 g kg-1 crude protein) supplemented with BCAAs to the ratio of 2:1:2 not only had higher average daily gain (P < 0.05) and carcass weight (P < 0.05) but also improved meat tenderness and juiciness by decreasing shear force (P < 0.05) and increasing water-holding capacity (P < 0.05). In particular, this treatment showed higher (P < 0.05) levels of phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (P-ACC) and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), and lower (P < 0.05) levels of P-adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (P-AMPK), increasing the composition of IMF and MyHC I (P < 0.05) in the longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM). In terms of health, this group increased eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (P < 0.01) and desirable hypocholesterolemic fatty acids (DHFA) (P < 0.05), and decreased atherogenicity (AI) (P < 0.01) and hypercholesterolemic saturated fatty acids (HSFA) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a novel role for a balanced BCAA-supplemented restricted protein (RP) diet in the epigenetic regulation of more tender and healthier pork by increasing IMF deposition and fiber type conversion, providing a cross-regulatory molecular basis for revealing the nutritional regulation network of meat quality. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage and atrial remodeling serve as the crucial substrates for the genesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) catabolic defect plays critical roles in multiple cardiovascular diseases. However, the alteration of atrial BCAA catabolism and its role in AF remain largely unknown. This study aimed to explore the role of BCAA catabolism in the pathogenesis of AF and to further evaluate the therapeutic effect of melatonin with a focus on protein kinase G (PKG)-cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15) signaling. We found that angiotensin II-treated atria exhibited significantly elevated BCAA level, reduced BCAA catabolic enzyme activity, increased AF vulnerability, aggravated atrial electrical and structural remodeling, and enhanced mitochondrial ROS damage. These deleterious effects were attenuated by melatonin co-administration while exacerbated by BCAA oral supplementation. Melatonin treatment ameliorated BCAA-induced atrial damage and reversed BCAA-induced down-regulation of atrial PKGIα expression, CREB phosphorylation as well as KLF15 expression. However, inhibition of PKG partly abolished melatonin-induced beneficial actions. In summary, these data demonstrated that atrial BCAA catabolic defect contributed to the pathogenesis of AF by aggravating tissue fibrosis and mitochondrial ROS damage. Melatonin treatment ameliorated Ang II-induced atrial structural as well as electrical remodeling by activating PKG-CREB-KLF15. The present study reveals additional mechanisms contributing to AF genesis and highlights the opportunity of a novel therapy for AF by targeting BCAA catabolism. Melatonin may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for AF intervention.",

METHODS: One hundred eighty-three newly diagnosed T2DM patients within the CORDIOPREV study are randomized to consume the Med or a LF diet. BCAA plasma levels (isoleucine, leucine, and valine) are measured at fasting and after 120 min of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at the baseline of the study and after 5 years of the dietary intervention. RESULTS: Isoleucine, leucine, and valine plasma levels after 120 min of an OGTT in the Med diet (N = 80) are associated by COX analysis with T2DM remission: HR per SD (95% CI): 0.53 (0.37-0.77), 0.75 (0.52-1.08), and 0.61 (0.45-0.82), respectively; no association is found in patients who consumed a LF diet (N = 103). BCAA plasma levels combined in a score show a HR of 3.33 (1.55-7.19) of T2DM remission for patients with a high score values in the Med diet, while in those with a LF diet, no association is found. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that BCAA measurements potentially be used as a tool to select the most suitable diet to induce T2DM remission by nutritional strategies.",

However, the characteristics of plasma amino acid profiles in patients with HBV-related cirrhosis and the impacts of late-evening snack (LES) on cirrhosis are unclear. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the characteristics of plasma amino acid profiles in patients with HBV-related chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and the effects of late-evening snacks on plasma amino acid profiles. METHODS: 86 patients with HBV-related cirrhosis and eighty patients with chronic hepatitis B were included in this study. The plasma amino acid profiles were measured by the amino acid analyzer. Patients were randomly divided into two groups, of which the liver cirrhosis group was to receive daily LES (n = 43) or non-LES (n = 43) for 6 months. Plasma amino acid profiles and biochemical parameters were measured in both groups at baseline and after 1, 3, and 6 months. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, the plasma concentration in the liver cirrhosis group of threonine, serine, glycine, glutamine, cysteine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, arginine, and methionine increased significantly (P < 0.05), while the ratio of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) to aromatic amino acids (AAA) decreased significantly (P < 0.05). A carbohydrate-predominant LES treatment resulted in a significant increase in BCAA/AAA and decrease in the level of ammonia and glutamine compared with baseline after 6 months of supplementation (P < 0.05). Patients with Child-Pugh B and C are more responsive to changes in amino acid profiles than those with Child-Pugh A. CONCLUSIONS: The application of an LES carbohydrate module for six months in liver cirrhosis patients was associated with increased BCAA/AAA and decreased level of ammonia. Patients with Child-Pugh B and C grades were the most beneficial population.",

Amino acids offer novel biomarkers to predict risk of T2DM and indicate sub-optimal disease management, which could facilitate earlier treatment. We studied amino acid profiles in a Thai cohort comprising of individuals with T2DM (n = 65 single-drug-treated; n = 38 multi-drug-treated) compared to healthy controls (n = 104) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Age and BMI were significantly lower in the healthy controls compared to the single or multi-treated T2DM groups. The BCAA (leucine and valine) were significantly lower in the single and multi-treated T2DM groups compared to healthy controls (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001) and isoleucine was significantly lower in the single-treated compared to the healthy controls (p = 0.014). These findings beg the question whether BCAAs supplementation be beneficial in T2DM patients treated with single or multi-drug therapy? Tyrosine was significantly lower in the single and multi-treated T2DM groups compared to healthy controls (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002), whereas phenylalanine was significantly higher in the multi-treated T2DM group compared to the single treated T2DM group (p = 0.045). We provide novel insights into the effects of diabetes treatments on these amino acids in insulin resistant states such as T2DM in a unique but understudied Thai population."

The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a BCAA mixture on muscle metabolism and related gene expression in vitro. METHODS: C2C12 myotubes were treated with a BCAA mixture containing leucine:isoleucine:valine at a ratio of 2:1:1 at 0.2, 2, or 20 mM (based on leucine content) for 6 days. qRT-PCR was used to measure metabolic gene expression. Oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification were used to assess mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolism, respectively. Mitochondrial content was determined via mitochondrial-specific staining. RESULTS: Despite significantly elevated mitochondrial staining, 6-day BCAA treatment reduced basal mitochondrial metabolism at a supraphysiological concentration (20 mM) in both insulin sensitive and resistant cells. Peak mitochondrial capacity was also reduced in insulin-resistant (but not insulin sensitive) cells. Conversely, basal glycolytic metabolism was elevated following 20 mM BCAA treatment, regardless of insulin resistance. In addition, insulin-resistant cells treated with 20 mM BCAA exhibited reduced gene expression of Ppargc1a, Cytc, Atp5b, Glut4, and several glycolytic enzymes versus insulin sensitive cells treated with 20 mM BCAA. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings suggest BCAA at supraphysiologically high levels may negatively alter mitochondrial metabolism, and concurrent insulin resistance may also diminish peak mitochondrial capacity, as well as impede molecular adaptations that support a transition to a glycolytic preference/compensation.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to determine whether the addition of an oral nutritional supplement with whey peptides and branched-chain amino acids for cardiac rehabilitation improves cardiopulmonary function, skeletal muscle function, and metabolism in CHF patients.In this randomized, parallel-group comparative pilot study, 20 CHF patients were randomly assigned to the nutrition group (n = 10) or the control group (n = 10). At baseline and 12 weeks, we performed physical examinations, motor function evaluation, clinical laboratory tests, nutritional status assessment, and echocardiography. The primary outcome was exercise tolerance, as determined by the cardiopulmonary stress test (CPX), 6-minute walking test (6MWT), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels.During follow-up, body weight, body mass index, total muscle mass, and total lean mass did not change significantly in either group. The total fat mass significantly increased in the nutrition group (14.3 ± 5.4 kg versus 16.1 ± 5.5 kg, P < 0.001) but did not change in the control group, and the difference in the changes in total fat mass between groups was significant (-0.26 ± 0.96 kg versus 1.49 ± 0.63 kg, P < 0.001). The peakVO2 and 6-minute walk test (6 MWT) significantly increased in the nutrition group (14.6 ± 3.4 mL/minute/kg versus 15.8 ± 3.8 mL/minute/kg, P = 0.029; 346.9 ± 103.1 m versus 382.7 ± 102.1 m, P = 0.048; respectively) but did not change in the control group. The changes in peakVO2 and 6MWT did not significantly differ between the groups.The oral nutritional supplement for the treatment of CHF was effective for cardiac rehabilitation in terms of fat mass and exercise capacity.The present study demonstrated that oral nutritional supplements with whey peptides and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) for cardiac rehabilitation in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) increased fat mass and exercise capacity. We conclude that whey peptides and BCAA supplementation may be a useful treatment for CHF patients.",

      "abstract": "Background: Cyclophosphamide is a common tumor chemotherapy drug used to treat various cancers. However, the resulting immunosuppression leads to leukopenia, which is a serious limiting factor in clinical application. Therefore, the introduction of immunomodulators as adjuvant therapy may help to reduce the hematological side effects of cyclophosphamide. Lvjiaobuxue granule has been widely used in the clinical treatment of gynecological diseases such as anemia and irregular menstruation. Recently, it has been found to increase the function of white blood cells, but its mechanism of action is still unclear. We aimed to reveal the mechanisms of Lvjiaobuxue granule against acute leukopenia by an integrated strategy combining metabolomics with network pharmacology. Methods: Subcutaneously inoculated 4T1 breast cancer cells to prepare tumor-bearing mice, intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide to establish a 4T1 tumor-bearing mice leukopenia animal model, using pharmacodynamic indicators, metabolomics, network pharmacology and molecular biology and other technical methods. To comprehensively and systematically elucidate the effect and mechanism of Lvjiaobuxue granule in improving cyclophosphamide-induced leukopenia in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Results: Lvjiaobuxue granule can improve the blood routine parameters and organ index levels of the leukopenia model of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Metabolomics studies revealed that 15 endogenous metabolites in the spleen of mice were considered as potential biomarkers of Lvjiaobuxue granule for their protective effect. Metabonomics and network pharmacology integrated analysis indicated that Lvjiaobuxue granule exerted the leukocyte elevation activity by inhibiting the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) degradation pathway and increasing the levels of valine, leucine and isoleucine. The results of molecular biology also showed that Lvjiaobuxue granule can significantly regulate the key enzymes in the catabolism of BCAAs, which further illustrates the importance of BCAAs in improving leukopenia. Conclusion: Lvjiaobuxue granule exerts obvious pharmacological effects on the leukopenia model of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice induced by cyclophosphamide, which could be mediated by regulating the branched-chain amino acid degradation pathway and the levels of valine, leucine and isoleucine."

Previous studies have documented the beneficial effect of AB23A on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but the functional interactions between gut microbiota and the anti-NAFLD effect of AB23A remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the benefits of experimental treatment with AB23A on gut microbiota dysbiosis in NAFLD with an obesity model. C57BL/6J mice were administrated a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without AB23A for 12 weeks. AB23A significantly improved metabolic phenotype in the HFD-fed mice. Moreover, results of 16S rRNA gene-based amplicon sequencing in each group reveled that AB23A not only reduced the abundance of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidaeota ratio and Actinobacteriota/Bacteroidaeota ratio, but regulated the abundance of the top 10 genera, including norank_f__Muribaculaceae, Lactobacillus, Ileibacterium, Turicibacter, Faecalibaculum, the Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, unclassified_f__Lachnospiraceae, and norank_f__Lachnospiraceae. AB23A significantly reduced the serum levels of lipopolysaccharide and branched-chain amino acids, which are positively correlated with the abundances of Ileibacterium and Turicibacter. Moreover, AB23A led to remarkable reductions in the activation of TLR4, NF-κB, and mTOR, and upregulated the expression of tight junction proteins, including ZO-1 and occludin. These results revealed that AB23A displayed a prebiotic capacity in HFD-fed NAFLD mice.",

Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) have been reported to improve the symptoms of HE induced by hyperammonemia; however, we recently reported that ammonia increases intracellular levels of BCAA and exerts toxic effects on astrocytes. OBJECTIVES: This follow-up study was designed to confirm the direct effects of BCAA on human astrocytes and clarify their underlying mechanisms using metabolome analysis and evaluation of associated signaling. METHODS: We performed cytotoxicity and cell proliferation tests on astrocytes following BCAA treatment with and without ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and then compared the results with the effects of BCAA on hepatocytes and neurons. Subsequently, we used metabolomic analysis to investigate intracellular metabolite levels in astrocytes with and without BCAA treatment. RESULTS: The astrocytes showed increased leakage of intracellular lactate dehydrogenase and reduced proliferation rate upon BCAA treatment. Interestingly, our analysis showed a BCAA-induced impairment of intracellular glycolysis/glyconeogenesis as well as amino acid and butyric acid metabolism. Furthermore, BCAA treatment was found to cause decreased levels of Glut-1 and phosphorylated GSK-3β and mTOR in astrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Although further investigations of the effect of BCAA on human astrocytes with hyperammonemia are needed, our work demonstrates that BCAA supplementation has direct negative effects on astrocyte survival and intracellular metabolism."

      "abstract": "SCOPE: This study investigated the combined effect of the angiotensin II (AT-II) receptor blocker losartan and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) on skeletal muscle atrophy in rats with cirrhosis and steatohepatitis. METHOD AND RESULTS: Fischer 344 rats are fed a choline-deficient l-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet for 12 weeks and treated with oral losartan (30 mg kg-1 day-1 ) and/or BCAAs (Aminoleban EN, 2500 mg kg-1 day-1 ). Treatment with losartan and BCAAs attenuated hepatic inflammation and fibrosis and improved skeletal muscle atrophy and strength in CDAA-fed rats. Both agents reduced intramuscular myostatin and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, resulting in inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) through interference with the SMAD and nuclear factor-kappa B pathways, respectively. Losartan also augmented the BCAA-mediated increase of skeletal muscle mass by promoting insulin growth factor-I production and mitochondrial biogenesis. Moreover, losartan decreased the intramuscular expression of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a transcriptional inducer of E3 ubiquitin ligase regulated by AT-II. In vitro assays illustrated that losartan promoted mitochondrial biogenesis and reduced TFEB expression in AT-II-stimulated rat myocytes, thereby potentiating the inhibitory effects of BCAAs on the UPS and caspase-3 cleavage. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that this regimen could serve as a novel treatment for patients with sarcopenia and liver cirrhosis.",

The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of soy lecithin (SLC), zinc oxide (ZnO), and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) on the bioaccessibility and intestinal transport of BCAAs from animal and plant protein mixtures (PMs) via an in vitro digestion model with human intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells. The bioaccessibility of total BCAAs in PMs considerably increased by 107.51 ± 1.50% with the addition of SLC, and the combined effects of SLC, ZnO, and MSM on enhancing the bioaccessibility of total BCAAs was observed (107.14 ± 0.18%). Interestingly, SLC showed a major role in binding bile acid, showing 65.78 ± 1.66% of binding capacity. Intestinal transport of BCAAs was measured to be at 100.48, 110.86, and 130.29 μg mL-1 for leucine, isoleucine, and valine, respectively, in PMs with SLC + ZnO + MSM, and it eventually amplified the amount of the total transported BCAAs (341.63 ± 6.34 μg mL-1), which was about 8.72 times higher than that of PM only. The cellular integrity of digesta-treated Caco-2 cells tended to decrease according to the incubation time, but it was recovered in the treatment of PM + SLC + ZnO + MSM, and nearly reached the control levels with 92.82 ± 0.53%. Results from the current study suggest that the co-consumption of proteins equally consisting of plant and animal sources with SLC, ZnO, and MSM could improve the bioavailability of total BCAAs, resulting in the improvement of health benefits.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The ageing process implies several physiological and psychological changes that hence affect the general health, mood states, and quality of life of older persons. Exercise and adequate nutrition are renowned non-pharmacological strategies that significantly delay and alleviate the adverse consequences of the ageing process. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation and a multicomponent exercise program (ME) on the physical frailty and mood states of older persons. METHODS: 35 participants (women and men; 83 ± 3 years old) from residential care homes were submitted to a 40-week exercise-washout-retraining intervention (16 weeks of the elastic band based exercise and/or supplementation, 8 weeks of washout, and 16 weeks of multicomponent exercise and/or resupplementing), with or without BCAA supplementation. The experimental groups were: (i) ME plus BCAA supplementation (ME+BCAA); (ii) ME; (iii) BCAA supplementation (BCAA), and (iv) control group (CG). Fried's phenotype was used to assess frailty prevalence. Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Profile of Mood State (POMS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), were used to access mental health and cognition. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) was used to access functional capacity. Salivary testosterone levels (ST) were also determined to access the anabolic effects of the intervention. RESULTS: Exercise was effective in improving functional capacity and prevented the increase in frailty that occurred in the non-exercising CG, where the frailty scores increased over time (p < 0.01). BCAAs supplement alone had no impact on functional fitness, but in a short time (16 weeks) contributed to diminishing frailty and combined with exercise may have the potential to reduce the effect of a detraining period on functional capacity. Salivary testosterone levels correlated with handgrip strength and could be a useful indicator of susceptibility to frailty. No effects were found for mood states, cognition, and depression. CONCLUSION: This study showed that a long-term exercise program, independent of being multicomponent or strength elastic band-based, was effective in improving functional capacity and prevented an increase in frailty in frail and pre-frail older persons living in residential care homes.",

METHODS: A total of 75 severe abdominal trauma patients were recruited from June 2016 to December 2017 and randomly divided into control group and observation group. After surgery and basic treatment, parenteral nutrition support therapy with iso-nitrogen and iso-calorie of both groups was administered. Meanwhile, an equivalent of 8.5% (18AA-II) and 10% (20AA) compound AA injection was administrated to the control and observation groups, respectively. The nitrogen balance, serum protein level and plasma amino spectrum of the patients were observed before and after treatment. Besides, the hospital stay, survival rate, complications, adverse reactions and hospitalization costs were also compared. RESULTS: After a 7-day course treatment, the nitrogen balance level of the two groups was significantly improved, but no significant difference was found between them. In addition, the serum protein level and plasma amino spectrum of the two groups was generally improved when compared to before treatment. Compared with the control group, the level of albumin and transferrin in the observation group was improved significantly after treatment, while no difference in plasma amino spectrum was found between the two groups. Moreover, the cost analysis showed remarkably reduced hospitalization costs in the observation group. CONCLUSION: To a certain degree, BCAAs could improve the nutritional metabolism and prognosis of patients with severe abdominal trauma, and have good cost-effectiveness.",

Feed intake (FI) and body weight (BW) were measured daily and weekly, respectively. At week 6, blood samples were collected, all pigs euthanized and tissue samples collected. The data were analyzed by univariate GLM or mixed procedure (SPSS) and the means were separated using paired Student's t-test followed by Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Relative to PC, NC had decreased FI, BW, unsupplemented plasma essential amino acids, serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) (P < 0.01). Compared to NC, L25 or L50, LB50 had increased BW and serum IGF-I and decreased plasma serotonin and both LB25 and LB50 had higher FI, plasma BCAA, hypothalamic 5-hydroxytryptamine-receptor 2A and NPY and jejunal 5-hydroxytryptamine-receptor 7 (P < 0.01). Overall, supplementation of protein-restricted diets with increased levels of dietary BCAA partially recovered the negative effects of these diets on growth through improved IGF-I concentration and FI, which was associated with changed expression of serotonin receptors, blood AA and hypothalamic NPY."

However, it is unclear if BCAA independently promote insulin resistance in otherwise healthy cells. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a BCAA mixture on muscle insulin signaling in vitro in both insulin resistant and sensitive cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C2C12 myotubes were treated with a BCAA mixture containing leucine:isoleucine:valine at a ratio of 2:1:1 at 0.2, 2, or 20 mM (based on leucine content) for either 30 min, 1 day, or 6 days. Western blot was used to assess insulin sensitivity of cells treated with BCAA both with and without concurrent insulin resistance, and, with and without insulin stimulation. RESULTS: BCAA treatment for 1 day significantly reduced basal, but not insulin-stimulated pAkt expression. BCAA treatment for 6 days resulted in significantly reduced basal insulin signaling in healthy cells and insulin-stimulated insulin signaling in insulin resistant (but not insulin sensitive) cells. CONCLUSION: Similar to previous observations demonstrating BCAA may correlate with insulin resistance during metabolically stressed conditions, we demonstrate excessively high BCAA exposure can negatively influence basal insulin signaling, as well as insulin sensitivity in insulin resistant myotubes. However, given the intentionally high concentrations of BCAA used in this study, the extent to which these observations translate to in vivo models is unclear and warrants further investigation.",

      "abstract": "Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are critical for skeletal muscle and whole-body anabolism and energy homeostasis. They also serve as signaling molecules, for example, being able to activate mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). This has implication for macronutrient metabolism. However, elevated circulating levels of BCAAs and of their ketoacids as well as impaired catabolism of these amino acids (AAs) are implicated in the development of insulin resistance and its sequelae, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and of some cancers, although other studies indicate supplements of these AAs may help in the management of some chronic diseases. Here, we first reviewed the catabolism of these AAs especially in skeletal muscle as this tissue contributes the most to whole body disposal of the BCAA. We then reviewed emerging mechanisms of control of enzymes involved in regulating BCAA catabolism. Such mechanisms include regulation of their abundance by microRNA and by post translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination. We also reviewed implications of impaired metabolism of BCAA for muscle and whole-body metabolism. We comment on outstanding questions in the regulation of catabolism of these AAs, including regulation of the abundance and post-transcriptional/post-translational modification of enzymes that regulate BCAA catabolism, as well the impact of circadian rhythm, age and mTORC1 on these enzymes. Answers to such questions may facilitate emergence of treatment/management options that can help patients suffering from chronic diseases linked to impaired metabolism of the BCAAs."

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Elevated concentrations of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) are strong predictors of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Their association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains uncertain, particularly in youth. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the role of BCAA and aromatic amino acids (AAA) in obesity, their relationships with novel biomarkers of CVD, and response to a physical activity-based lifestyle intervention (PAL-I) in a randomized controlled study in youth with normal weight (NW) and obesity (OB). METHODS: Age (14-18 years) and Tanner stage (≥IV) matched youth (OB, n = 15 and NW, n = 6) were studied; the 15 participants with OB underwent a 3-month randomized controlled PAL-I. Circulating amino acid profile, glucose, insulin, lipids, adiponectin, retinol binding protein-4, fibrinogen, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and 25-hydroxy vitamin-D, along with body composition, were measured at baseline and after PAL-I. Independent t tests, analysis of covariance, and mixed-effect models were used for analysis of the data. RESULTS: Compared with NW, the concentration of various amino acids, including BCAA and AAA, were altered in OB (P < 0.05). BCAA and AAA showed baseline correlations with body composition and novel biomarkers of CVD, particularly inflammatory factors (all P < 0.05). The PAL-I produced only negligible effects (P > 0.05) on BCAA and AAA. Glutamine, glycine, and aspartic acid decreased with PAL-I (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The novel finding of the BCAA-inflammation relationship, along with strong correlations with nontraditional biomarkers of CVD, may raise the prospect of BCAA as a biomarker of CVD and evoke a potential link between obesity, T2DM, and CVD.",

      "abstract": "Essential amino acids (EAA) are critical for multiple physiological processes. Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation provides energy substrates, promotes protein synthesis, and stimulates insulin secretion in rodents and humans. Most dairy cows face a protein and energy deficit during the first weeks postpartum and utilize body reserves to counteract this shortage. The objective was to evaluate the effect of rumen-protected BCAA (RP-BCAA; 375 g of 27% l-leucine, 85 g of 48% l-isoleucine, and 91 g of 67% l-valine) with or without oral propylene glycol (PG) administration on markers of liver health status, concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in plasma, and liver triglycerides (TG) during the early postpartum period in dairy cows. Multiparous Holstein cows were enrolled in blocks of 3 and randomly assigned to either the control group or 1 of the 2 treatments from calving until 35 d postpartum. The control group (n = 16) received 200 g of dry molasses per cow/d; the RP-BCAA group (n = 14) received RP-BCAA mixed with 200 g of dry molasses per cow/d; the RP-BCAA plus PG (RP-BCAAPG) group (n = 16) received RP-BCAA mixed with 200 g of dry molasses per cow/d, plus 300 mL of PG, once daily from calving until 7 d in milk (DIM). The RP-BCAA and RP-BCAAGP groups, on average (± standard deviation), were predicted to receive a greater supply of metabolizable protein in the form of l-Leu 27.4 ± 3.5 g/d, l-Ile 15.2 ± 1.8 g/d, and l-Val 24.2 ± 2.4 g/d compared with the control cows. Liver biopsies were collected at d 9 ± 4 prepartum and at 5 ± 1 and 21 ± 1 DIM. Blood was sampled 3 times per week from calving until 21 DIM. Milk yield, dry matter intake, NEFA, BHB, EAA blood concentration, serum chemistry, insulin, glucagon, and liver TG and protein abundance of total and phosphorylated branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase E1α (p-BCKDH-E1α) were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. Cows in the RP-BCAA and RP-BCAAPG groups had lower liver TG and lower activities of aspartate aminotransferase and glutamate dehydrogenase during the first 21 DIM, compared with control. All cows, regardless of treatment, showed an upregulation of p-BCKDH-E1α at d 5 postpartum, compared with levels at 21 d postpartum. Insulin, Met, and Glu blood concentration were greater in RP-BCAA and RP-BCAAPG compared with control during the first 35 DIM. Therefore, the use of RP-BCAA in combination with PG might be a feasible option to reduce hepatic lipidosis in dairy cows during early lactation.",

METHODS: Eight-week randomized double-blind crossover BA (5.0 g·day-1 of β-alanine) versus ALK (0.07 g·kgFFM-1·day-1 of sodium bicarbonate) supplementation combined with BCAA (0.2 g·kgFFM-1·day-1) and TCM (0.05 g·kgFFM-1·day-1) during a standard 8-week taekwondo training period was implemented. In the course of the experiment, body composition (dual X-ray absorptiometry), aerobic capacity (ergospirometric measurements during an incremental treadmill test until exhaustion), and exercise blood biomarkers concentrations were measured. Data were analyzed using repeated measures within-between interaction analysis of variance with the inclusion of experimental supplementation order. RESULTS: The maximum post-exercise blood ammonia concentration decreased in both groups after supplementation (from 80.3 ± 10.6 to 72.4 ± 10.2 µmol∙L-1, p = 0.013 in BA; from 81.4 ± 8.7 to 74.2 ± 8.9 µmol∙L-1, p = 0.027 in ALK), indicating reduced exercise-related adenosine triphosphate degradation. However, no differences were found in body composition, aerobic capacity, blood lactate concentration, and hematological parameters after neither BA (combined with BCAA and TCM) nor ALK (combined with BCAA and TCM) supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: In highly trained taekwondo athletes, neither extra- nor intracellular buffering enhancement resulting from BA and ALK supplementation, combined with BCAA and TCM treatment, affects body mass and composition, maximum oxygen uptake, and hematological indices, even though certain advantageous metabolic adaptations can be observed.",

METHODS: This is a pilot, prospective, randomized, and double-blind study of a cohort of 32 patients with cirrhosis and sarcopenia diagnosed by computed tomography scan who underwent a nutritional and physical activity intervention for 12 weeks. They were divided into 2 groups (placebo: 17 patients; BCAA: 15 patients). The study protocol was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04073693). RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. After treatment, only the BCAA group presented a significant improvement in muscle mass (43.7 vs 46 cm2/m2; P = 0.023). Seventeen patients (63%) presented improvement in muscle mass overall, which was more frequent in the BCAA group (83.3 vs 46.7%; P = 0.056). Regarding frailty, there was a significant improvement in the Liver Frailty Index in the global cohort (n = 32) after the 12 weeks (4.2 vs 3.9; P < 0.001). This difference was significant in both groups: in the placebo group (4.2 vs 3.8; P < 0.001) and in the BCAA group (4.2 vs 3.9; P < 0.001). After treatment, the BCAA group had a higher increase in zinc levels than the placebo group (Δzinc: 12.3 vs 5.5; P = 0.026). In addition, there was a trend for greater improvement of albumin levels in the BCAA group (Δalbumin: 0.19 vs 0.04; P = 0.091). DISCUSSION: BCAA supplementation improves muscle mass in cirrhotic patients with sarcopenia.",

While the precise components of a PR diet that mediate the beneficial effects to longevity have not been defined, we recently showed that many metabolic effects of PR can be attributed to reduced dietary levels of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Here, we demonstrate that restricting dietary BCAAs increases the survival of two different progeroid mouse models, delays frailty and promotes the metabolic health of wild-type C57BL/6J mice when started in midlife, and leads to a 30% increase in lifespan and a reduction in frailty in male, but not female, wild-type mice when fed lifelong. Our results demonstrate that restricting dietary BCAAs can increase healthspan and longevity in mice, and suggest that reducing dietary BCAAs may hold potential as a translatable intervention to promote healthy aging.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are used as nutritional support and for improving prognosis in liver cirrhosis. Here we investigate the molecular mechanisms of BCAA treatment and liver damage focused on pathways related to lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP). METHODS: Serum LBP levels were measured in cirrhotic patients and in cirrhotic rats treated with BCAA to examine the correlation between liver function and survival. In cirrhotic rats, liver damage, Enterococcus faecalis translocation, serum capsular polysaccharide, and intestinal tight junction levels were assessed. Damaged HepG2 cells were cultured with BCAA-supplemented, BCAA-deficient, or control amino acid medium, followed by examination of LBP expression. RESULTS: Serum LBP levels were significantly increased in deceased patients individuals with liver cirrhosis. The survival rate in patients with lower serum LBP (<3.48 μg/mL) was significantly improved. In BCAA-treated rat liver samples, protein expression of LBP, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and phosphorylated signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were significantly reduced. Also in BCAA-treated rats, intestinal zonula occludens gene expression was increased, whereas hepatic translocation of E. faecalis and serum capsular polysaccharide levels were reduced. In damaged HepG2 cells, lipopolysaccharide-induced elevation of LBP expression was rapidly and strongly repressed in BCAA-enriched medium. CONCLUSIONS: Serum LBP level is a prognostic biomarker in liver cirrhosis. BCAA treatment reduced translocation of E. faecalis through intestinal tight junction recovery and reduced LBP expression in the liver, which repressed activation of LBP, toll-like receptor 4, and signal transduction and activator of transcription 3. Our findings suggest that BCAA supplementation protects the liver from damage via multiple pathways.",
