      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Hair disorders, which are often attributed to conditions associated with a shortened anagen growth phase, oxidative stress, and hormonal dysregulation, especially during aging, have profound psychological implications. Currently, only minoxidil has been approved as a topical hair growth solution; thus, alternative therapies for treating hair loss and promoting hair health are urgently needed. Herein, we aimed to develop and assess a novel method to promote hair growth and health using mastic (Pistacia lentiscus) gum and peppermint (Mentha piperita L.) extracts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After determining the optimal ratio of mastic gum and peppermint extracts, we performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to verify the efficacy of the 7:3 mastic gum-peppermint mixture (MP73; FHH-MG) for enhancing hair growth and health. RESULTS: Mastic gum significantly promoted cell proliferation and demonstrated synergistic benefits when combined with peppermint extract. In vitro, FHH-MG increased human dermal follicle papilla cell proliferation and demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In vivo, treatment with FHH-MG dose-dependently enhanced hair growth and gloss and increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor, β-catenin, and insulin-like growth factor-1 in C57BL/6 mice compared to the negative control. CONCLUSION: The novel mixture exhibited hair growth-promoting effects in C57BL/6 mice; thus, FHH-MG may serve as a botanical alternative for hair growth and health promotion.",

      "abstract": "Sage and peppermint leaves and flowers possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic-regulating properties. This study compared the phenolic profiles confirmed using LC-MS/MS analysis and the biological activities of traditionally prepared sage (SJ) and peppermint juices (PJ), evaluating their ex vivo antioxidant enzyme activity and antidiabetic potential in experimental mice. Quinic acid (2571.86 ± 1.15 µg/g dry weight (d.w.)) and apigenin-7-O-β-glucoside (324.36 ± 1.15 µg/g d.w.) were the predominant phenolic compounds in SJ, while PJ contained caffeic acid (16.96 ± 0.12 µg/g d.w.) and quinic acid (184.27 ± 0.45 µg/g d.w.). The administration of SJ and PJ for ten days significantly reduced the blood glucose levels of the mice. Compared to the control group, which showed an increase from 15.89 ± 3.45 to 29.54 ± 8.94 mmoL/L, SJ-20 mg/kg body weight (BW)-treated mice exhibited a more moderate rise (16.25 ± 7.33 to 21.50 ± 10.38 mmoL/L). Juice administration also enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity, with PJ-20 mg/kg BW significantly increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (30.15 ± 3.99 U/mg proteins) compared to the control (18.83 ± 2.04 U/mg proteins). Additionally, catalase (CAT) activity was elevated, indicating enhanced oxidative stress defense mechanisms. Furthermore, treatment with SJ-20 mg/kg BW reduced aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (7025.8 ± 1038.8 to 2782 ± 426.9 IU/L) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (10679 ± 1409.2 to 5336.5 ± 801.5 IU/L), suggesting hepatoprotective effects. These results support the traditional use of sage and peppermint juices as functional beverages with antioxidant, antidiabetic, and hepatoprotective properties, warranting further clinical investigation."

      "abstract": "Seed germination is a critical stage in crop growth and is often limited by various biotic and abiotic factors that hinder plant establishment. Seed priming is a pre-sowing treatment that prepares seeds, enhancing the potential for more vigorous seedling emergence. This study aimed to explore the effects of leaf extracts from Peppermint, Thyme, Rosemary, and Savory, both individually and in combination, as seed priming agents on the early germination stages of Adenium arabicum and Euphorbia viguieri, which were grown in pots in a greenhouse. In the experiment, seeds of A. arabicum and E. viguieri were soaked in leaf extracts at concentrations of 10%, 20%, and 30%, and treated with the fungicide mixture of carbendazim and iprodione at a rate of 2%. A completely randomized design was utilized, with three replications, featuring 20 seeds planted in each pot. The main compounds identified in the Peppermint, Rosemary, Savory, and Thyme leaf extracts through LC-MS analysis included caryophyllene oxide, β-caryophyllene, rosmarinic acid, cinnamic acid, caffeic acid, and limonene. The results showed that the application of these leaf extracts positively influenced key indicators, such as emergence and growth traits. Among the priming agents tested, the 10% extracts of Rosemary and Savory significantly improved germination and emergence rates of A. arabicum and E. viguieri (P < 0.05). The findings indicated a germination percentage of 100% for A. arabicum and 76.7% for E. viguieri, along with seedling lengths increasing by 30% and 20%, seed vigor indices rising by 30% and 15.3%, and leaf numbers of 8 and 4, respectively. While lower extract concentrations also enhanced early growth parameters such as germination percentage, seedling length, and vigor index, maximum improvement was observed with the 10% extracts of Rosemary and Savory. Therefore, these 10% extracts can be effectively used to promote seedling establishment and growth in A. arabicum and E. viguieri under pot conditions, demonstrating competitive efficacy compared to the commercial use of carbendazim + iprodione."

      "abstract": "The cognitive-enhancing effects of peppermint have been widely reported. Vasodilation, causing an increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the prefrontal cortex, has been implicated as a possible mediator. We tested this here. A total of N = 25 individuals, all aged over 18 years, were recruited via convenience sampling. A randomized, single blind placebo-controlled, independent groups design was used to assess whether groups (peppermint vs. placebo control) could be differentiated with respect to change in cognition, assessed via a computerized battery, and change in cerebral blood flow, assessed with Near-Infrared-Spectroscopy (NIRS), from pre-post intervention. Groups disparities in both cognitive and cerebrovascular change scores (from pre-post intervention) emerged. Improvements in cognitive performance were better in the peppermint group. Increases in hemodynamic activity, indexed by Oxygenated (Oxy-Hb) and Total hemoglobin (Total-Hb), were also greater in the peppermint group. Cerebrovascular changes from pre-to post-intervention were unrelated to cognitive changes over the same period, ruling out mediation effects. In conclusion, 200 mL of peppermint, consumed as tea, effectively boosted cognition and cerebral blood flow in otherwise healthy adults. Increased cerebral blood flow, however, did not mediate the cognitive-enhancing effects of peppermint. Future research incorporating larger samples and exploring other neurophysiological mediators is encouraged.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine whether aromatherapy with peppermint (Mentha piperita Mitcham), ginger (Zingiber officinale), and lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) reduces the severity of nausea in patients experiencing postoperative nausea after oral surgery under general anaesthesia. DESIGN: Single-centre, stratified (volatile inhaled anaesthetics used or not and sex, with balanced randomization), single-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in Japan. SETTING: Hokkaido University Hospital. INTERVENTIONS: Totally, 182 patients were randomized into two groups of aromatherapy: aroma group comprising three essential oils-peppermint, ginger, and lavender-each diluted to 1 % (each dose as pure essential oil was 0.01 ml) and control group with purified water only. Of these, 32 patients in the aroma group and 25 in the control group complained of postoperative nausea and were treated with intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in nausea severity at the onset of postoperative nausea. RESULTS: Nausea severity before the intervention did not differ between groups. Aromatherapy significantly reduced nausea severity (p < 0.001). The percentages of antiemetics used were 30.77 % and 52.38 % in the aroma and control groups, respectively, with no significant difference. The aroma group showed significantly higher satisfaction (p < 0.001). No adverse events were observed during the study. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that aromatherapy with peppermint, ginger, and lavender significantly improved patient satisfaction and severity of postoperative nausea after oral surgery under general anaesthesia. Therefore, given the benefits of aromatherapy, it would be advantageous to consider a combination of measures that include aromatherapy, as one of the multimodal antiemetic measures. This trial was registered at the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCTs: 01121002).",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Aromatherapy has not accrued enough evidence to be integrated into standardized clinical medicine. If high-quality evidence supports the effects of aromatherapy, it will be handled as a parallel option to standardized medical treatment. The aromatherapeutic impact of peppermint (Mentha × piperita L.) essential oil has been researched to a certain extent, such as on pain, anxiety, fatigue, or depression. Considering the rising expenditure on dementia care, the potential effects of peppermint scents on cognition have become increasingly significant. Therefore, we performed a scoping review of the studies on the impact of peppermint scents on cognition and attention. METHODS: We focused on human research, and the effects of peppermint scents were required to be inhaled. According to the inclusion criteria, searching from PubMed, Scopus, and Gale Academic OneFile, we identified a total of 115 studies. Finally, eight references were selected for review. The risk of bias was analyzed according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) criteria. RESULTS: Each reviewed reference had its own strength in investigating the effects of peppermint scents. However, as most studies have noted, the impact of peppermint scent should be assessed from multiple perspectives, including psychological, physiological, neurological, and pharmacological factors. The risk of bias was not found to be severe (high risk of bias rate: 35.7 ± 3.4%); our critical review elucidated the heterogeneity of the reviewed studies. CONCLUSION: In summary, drawing a definitive conclusion at this stage is premature. Therefore, more carefully designed studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis."

      "abstract": "In order to elucidate the active ingredients, potential targets, and mechanisms of action of peppermint in treating bovine mastitis, this study utilized network pharmacology analysis and molecular docking to conduct an exploratory, prospective investigation. Using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database, all compounds and targets of peppermint were retrieved. After removing duplicates, a total of 133 compounds and 272 targets were obtained. Targets were then standardized to gene names using the UniProt database to construct a drug-component-target network. A total of 183 disease targets related to bovine mastitis were retrieved from the GeneCards database. We obtained 28 cross targets of peppermint targets and bovine mastitis targets, and constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network using the STRING database. A visual network was built using Cytoscape 3.10.0 software, and seven core targets were analyzed and obtained. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was performed using the Metascape database. Molecular docking was conducted using AutoDockTools-1.5.6 software on some small-molecule compounds and the seven targets to evaluate the stability of binding between peppermint and core targets. Apigenin, luteolin, and ursolic acid are the three main components in peppermint. Core targets (TNF, IL-6, STAT-3, IL-1β, FGF-2, IFNG, and ESR-1) were selected based on the PPI network. The enrichment analysis suggested that the major signaling pathways in network pharmacology may include AGEs-RAGE, IL-17, NF-κB, TLRs, HIF-1, TGF-β, PI3K-Akt, and MAPK. The molecular docking results showed that one of the main components of mint, ursolic acid, exhibited good binding activity with all core targets of bovine mastitis. Other constituents also produced favorable binding with some core targets. This study elucidates the mechanisms of mint in treating bovine mastitis, providing data to support the potential development of new therapies for bovine mastitis using mint and its constituents."

Nanoparticles, due to their characteristics, are suitable candidates for disease treatment. The aim of this study is the in vitro evaluation of zinc nanoparticles coated with peppermint (Mentha piperita) essential oil on Leishmania major. The effects of different concentrations of Zn-Mp and meglumine antimoniate (MA; as a positive control) were studied on the promastigote and amastigote of Leishmania major, and their selectivity index (SI) was evaluated. The peaks at 2361.02 cm-1 (C-N stretching), 1213.78 cm-1 (CO-NH stretching), and 1110.83 cm-1 (C=O stretching) were attributed to Zn-Mp. The inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) was 17.48 μg/mL for Zn-Mp and 19.09 μg/mL for MA on promastigote (P = 0.47). It was 11.3 μg/mL for Zn-Mp and 14.1 μg/mL for MA on amastigote (P = 0.79). Lower IC50 on amastigote for Zn-Mp indicated better effectiveness on L. major compared to MA, but higher SI for MA (37.55) as compared to Zn-Mp (18.9) (P = 0.0002), highlighting more safety for MA. Compared to MA, the anti-leishmanial effect of Zn-Mp and its nontoxic effects on macrophages (SI > 10) show that Zn-Mp can be a candidate for the treatment of CL and it should be further studied on animal models."

      "abstract": "Aspergillus flavus contamination has long been a major problem in the food and agriculture industries, while peppermint essential oil (PEO) is increasingly recognized as an effective alternative for controlling fungal spoilage. However, its biocontrol effect and action mode on A. flavus have rarely been reported. Here, the inhibition rates of PEO on A. flavus were determined by the plate fumigation and mycelial dry weight method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was identified as 0.343 μL/mL. In the biocontrol tests, the moldy rates of maize kernels, wheat grains, and peanut kernels in the PEO treatment group were significantly reduced by 65%, 72%, and 63.33%, respectively. The biocontrol efficacy of PEO on maize kernels, wheat grains, and peanut kernels reached 80.67%, 82%, and 67.67%, respectively. Furthermore, antifungal action mode analysis showed that PEO changed the mycelial morphology, damaged the integrity of cell wall and membrane. Moreover, it reduced the ergosterol content, elevated the malondialdehyde content, increased the relative conductivity, and led to the intracellular leakage of nucleic acids and proteins, thereby enhancing the cell membrane permeability. In addition, PEO decreased the antioxidant-related catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, significantly increased the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content, and induced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mycelia. In conclusion, this study confirms that PEO, as an effective natural antimicrobial agent, has good application prospects in controlling the spoilage of A. flavus during grain storage and preventing food mold.",

METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled study consisted of 76 single-level cervical surgery patients admitted to the neurosurgery department between March 2021 and November 2022. The patients were randomized into 2 groups: the intervention group received peppermint oil aromatherapy through inhalation, whereas the control group received routine clinical treatment. Both groups were observed for the presence and severity of PONV, the use of antiemetics, and hemodynamic parameters at minute 5, 35, 65, and 95, and at hour 2, 6, 12, and 24 after surgery. RESULTS: In the control group, 18 (47.8%) patients experienced nausea, 11 (28.9%) experienced vomiting, and 7 (18.4%) used antiemetics. In contrast, the intervention group included only 2 (5.3%) patients who experienced nausea, and none of those patients experienced vomiting or used antiemetics. It was determined that peppermint oil had a 40% effect on reducing PONV, 34% effect on reducing postoperative antiemetic use, and 75% effect on reducing severity of nausea. Hemodynamic parameters did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. The systolic blood pressure of the control group was significantly greater than that of the intervention group only at minute 95 and at hour 24 after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the use of peppermint oil aromatherapy can have a positive effect on reducing the presence and severity of PONV and the need for antiemetic medication in patients undergoing single-level cervical surgery.",

      "abstract": "Alternaria alternata, a common necrotrophic fungal pathogen, poses a significant threat to various crops, causing substantial yield losses and quality deterioration. In the present study, we explore the potential fungicidal properties of Peppermint Oil Nanoemulsion (PNE) against A. alternata and investigate its impact on the fungal phenotype. Our previous study synthesized the PNE using a nanoemulsion approach, optimizing its formulation for enhanced stability and efficacy. The present study extended the assessment of a multidisciplinary approach to comprehensively analyze the fungicidal efficacy of PNE against A. alternata. Notably, in a liquid growth medium, 0.5 % of PNE could reduce A. alternata's biomass by 96 %. PNE-treated mycelia were stained with a nitro-blue tetrazolium (NBT) dye to assess ROS accumulation during oxidative stress induced by PNE. A higher degree of ROS generative potential of PNE has appeared in 72 h treated mycelia. PNE-treated mycelium showed cell wall alterations, with red fluorescence peaking at 0.5 %, indicating a dose-dependent effect compared to the untreated control. Consequently, PNE treatment led to a significant early hour increase in electrical conductivity (EC), extended to 306.03-353.33 μS/cm compared to 277.67-280.33 μS/cm untreated control. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis of A. alternata reflects the osmotic imbalance and structural damage in mycelia as the obvious cause of fungal inhibition. In addition, a phenotype microarray analysis of PNE-treated A. alternata mycelia revealed a significant phenotypic loss in 37 out of 708 substrates, potentially impacting metabolic pathways essential for fungi's functional processes. The study found that downregulation of genes like Cre A, NmrA, SOD, IMP, EfP, and Erg, which are linked to A. alternata's stress coping mechanisms, leads to alterations in survival and adaptation. Additionally, understanding the phenotypic changes induced by PNE contributes to our knowledge of the mode of action of this nanoemulsion against A. alternata. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the fungicidal and phenotypic effects of PNE, offering a promising avenue for sustainable fungal control. The implications of our research extend to the development of novel, natural fungicidal agents for agricultural applications.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of these drugs alone and combined with the well-known antispasmodic hyoscine butylbromide on the human colon. METHODS: Colon samples were obtained from macroscopically normal regions of 68 patients undergoing surgery and studied in muscle bath. Drotaverine, paracetamol, and peppermint oil were tested alone and in combination with hyoscine butylbromide on (1) spontaneous contractility induced by isometric stretch (in the presence of 1 µM tetrodotoxin) and (2) contractility induced by 10-5 M carbachol and after (3) electrical field stimulation-induced selective stimulation of excitatory (in the presence of 1 mM Nω-nitro-L-arginine and 10 µM MRS2179) and (4) inhibitory (under non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic conditions) pathways. (5) Drotaverine alone was also tested on cAMP-dependent pathway activated by forskolin. RESULTS: Compared with the vehicle, drotaverine and paracetamol (10-9-10-5 M) did not modify spontaneous contractions, carbachol-induced contractions, and responses attributed to selective activation of excitatory pathways. The addition of hyoscine butylbromide (10-7-10-5 M), concentration-dependently reduced myogenic contractions and carbachol- and electrical field stimulation-induced contractile responses. The association of paracetamol (10-4 M) and hyoscine butylbromide (10-7-10-5 M) was not different from hyoscine butylbromide alone (10-7-10-5 M). At higher concentrations (10-3M-3*10-3 M), paracetamol decreased myogenic and carbachol-induced contractions. The adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin, concentration-dependently reduced contractility, leading to smooth muscle relaxation. The effect of forskolin 10-7 M was concentration-dependently enhanced by drotaverine (10-6M-10-5M). DISCUSSION: Peppermint oil reduced myogenic activity and carbachol- and electrical field stimulation-induced contractions. The association of hyoscine butylbromide and peppermint oil was synergistic since the interaction index measured with the isobologram was lower than 1. No effect was seen on the neural-mediated inhibitory responses with any of the drugs studied although peppermint oil reduced the subsequent off-contraction. Drotaverine and hyoscine butylbromide have a complementary effect on human colon motility as one stimulates the cAMP inhibitory pathway and the other inhibits the excitatory pathway. Peppermint oil is synergic with hyoscine butylbromide suggesting that a combination therapy may be more effective in treating patients. In contrast, at therapeutic concentrations, paracetamol does not modify colonic contractility, suggesting that the association of paracetamol and hyoscine butylbromide has independent analgesic and antispasmodic properties."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study examines the impact of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) on gene expression associated with menthol biosynthesis and selected biochemical parameters in peppermint plants (Mentha piperita L.). Menthol, the active ingredient in peppermint, is synthesized through various pathways involving key genes like geranyl diphosphate synthase, menthone reductase, and menthofuran synthase. Seedlings were treated with different concentrations of TiO2NPs (50, 100, 200, and 300 ppm) via foliar spray. After three weeks of treatment, leaf samples were gathered and kept at -70 °C for analysis. RESULTS: According to our findings, there was a significant elevation (P ≤ 0.05) in proline content at concentrations of 200 and 300 ppm in comparison with the control. Specifically, the highest proline level was registered at 200 ppm, reaching 259.64 ± 33.33 µg/g FW. Additionally, hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde content exhibited a decreasing trend following nanoparticle treatments. Catalase activity was notably affected by varying TiO2NP concentrations, with a significant decrease observed at 200 and 300 ppm compared to the control (P ≤ 0.05). Conversely, at 100 ppm, catalase activity significantly increased (11.035 ± 1.12 units/mg of protein/min). Guaiacol peroxidase activity decreased across all nanoparticle concentrations. Furthermore, RT-qPCR analysis indicated increased expression of the studied genes at 300 ppm concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, it can be inferred that at the transcript level, this nanoparticle exhibited efficacy in influencing the biosynthetic pathway of menthol.",

      "abstract": "To extend the vase life of cut flowers, there is now a trend of using plant essential oils in place of synthetic chemicals, as they are fully biodegradable, more eco-friendly, and safer. The objective of this study was to examine the possible application and postharvest quality effects of three plant essential oils namely, ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe), peppermint (Mentha piperita L.), and citronella (Cymbopogon nardus Rendle), as natural vase solution for cut Dendrobium flowers. Peppermint essential oil showed promise as a holding solution for extending the vase life of Dendrobium orchids. To confirm vase life extension, emulsions containing peppermint essential oil at concentrations of 50 and 100 μg mL-1 combined with 4 % glucose to formulate holding solutions applied to Dendrobium orchids. Vase life, some biochemical changes, electrolyte leakage, total microbial count in the holding solution, and physical condition via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were evaluated over a period of 25 days. The three major compounds in peppermint essential oil were identified as menthol (33.24 %), 1-menthone (18.91 %) and menthofuran (14.85 %). The essential oil was applied in emulsion form as a holding solution. Treatment with 4 % glucose and either 50 or 100 μg mL-1 peppermint essential oil prolonged the vase life of Dendrobium orchids to up to 28 days. Scanning electron microscopy on Day 7 showed that the xylem vessels of treated orchids remained clear, suggesting reduced microbial plugging at the stalk end. Similarly, on Day 20, a reduced microbial cell count was observed for treated orchids (<1 log CFU mL-1) in comparison with controls (7.20 ± 0.04 log CFU mL-1). Finally, the essential oil improved flower quality by helping preserve petal membrane stability and petal anthocyanin content. Our results suggest the application of peppermint essential oil as a novel alternative to chemicals used in holding solutions for extending the vase life of Dendrobium orchids."

      "abstract": "The aim of this experiment was to investigate the effects of peppermint essential oil (PEO) and an emulsifier called artifier on growth performance, carcass characteristics, and nutrient digestibility of broiler chickens fed low-energy diets. A total of 240 one-day-old male Ross 308 broiler chickens were divided into five treatments: control, low-energy diet, low-energy diet + 150 ppm PEO, low-energy diet + 300 ppm artifier, and low-energy diet + 150 ppm PEO + 300 ppm artifier. Each treatment was replicated four times in a completely randomized design. The chickens were fed these treatments during the starter, grower, and finisher periods for a total of 42 days. The results indicated that broiler chickens receiving the low-energy diet supplemented with PEO + artifier had similar body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, and breast percentage, but exhibited significantly lower abdominal fat percentage compared to those fed the control diet (P < 0.05). Furthermore, birds receiving PEO and artifier in low-energy diets, either individually or in combination, demonstrated higher digestibility of dry matter and fat during the starter and grower periods in comparison to those receiving the low-energy diet without any additives (P < 0.05). Over the entire rearing period, the simultaneous inclusion of 150 ppm PEO and 300 ppm artifier in the low-energy diet resulted in comparable growth performance to the control diet. Additionally, the concurrent use of PEO and artifier in the low-energy diet for broiler chickens led to a decrease in abdominal fat, increased digestibility of fat and dry matter, and enhanced nutrient utilization compared to the control diet."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In pediatric dentistry, fear and anxiety are common among children. Local anesthetics (LA) are widely used to control pain and reduce discomfort in children during dental treatment. Topical anesthetics play a vital role in reducing pain and the unpleasant sensation of a needle puncture in children. Peppermint oil has been extensively used for various diseases. However, its anesthetic properties remain unknown. Peppermint oil, used in mouthwashes, toothpastes, and other topical preparations has analgesic, anesthetic, and antiseptic properties. This study aimed to compare and evaluate pain perception following the topical application of peppermint oil versus lignocaine spray before an intraoral injection in children, aged 8-13 years. METHOD: Fifty-two children, aged between 8-13 years, who required local anesthesia for dental treatment were divided into two groups of 26 each by simple random sampling (Group 1: 0.2% peppermint oil and Group 2: lignocaine spray). In both groups, physiological measurements (e.g., heart rate) were recorded using pulse oximetry before, during, and after the procedure. Objective pain measurement (Sound Eye Motor (SEM) scale) during administration and subjective measuremeant (Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBFPRS)) after LA administration were recorded. This was followed by the required treatment of the child.Physiological parameters were compared between the two groups using an independent t-test for intergroup assessment and a paired t-test and repeated-measures ANOVA for intragroup comparisons. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze the pain scores. RESULTS: Intragroup mean heart rates, before, during, and after treatment were statistically significantly different (P < 0.05). However, the intergroup mean pulse rates did not differ significantly between the two groups. The mean WBFPS score in the lignocaine spray group was 4.133 ± 2.06 was statistically different from that of the peppermint oil group (0.933 ± 1.03; P < 0.001*). The mean SEM score was significantly lower in the peppermint oil group than that in the lignocaine spray group (P = 0.006). No negative effects were observed in this study. CONCLUSION: 0.2% peppermint oil was effective in reducing pain perception."

The larvicidal activity of essential oils, a jasmine blend consisting of Jasmine oil and Azores jasmine (AJ) (Jasminum sambac and Jasminum azoricum) and peppermint (PP) Mentha arvensis and their nanoformulations against 2nd and 4th instar larvae of Culex pipiens, was evaluated after subjecting to different concentrations (62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 ppm). Two forms of phase-different nanodelivery systems of layered double hydroxide LDH and oil/water nanoemulsions were formulated. The synthesized nanoemulsions showed particle sizes of 199 and 333 nm for AJ-NE and PP-NE, with a polydispersity index of 0.249 and 0.198, respectively. Chemical and physiochemical analysis of TEM, SEM, XRD, zeta potential, drug loading capacity, and drug release measurements were done to confirm the synthesis and loading efficiencies of essential oils' active ingredients. At high concentrations of AJ and PP nanoemulsions (2000 ppm), O/W nanoemulsions showed higher larval mortality than both LDH conjugates and crude oils. The mortality rate reached 100% for 2nd and 4th instar larvae. The relative toxicities revealed that PP nanoemulsion (MA-NE) was the most effective larvicide, followed by AJ nanoemulsion (AJ-NE). There was a significant increase in defensive enzymes, phenoloxidase, and α and β-esterase enzymes in the treated groups. After treatment of L4 with AJ, AJ-NE, PP, and PP-NE, the levels of phenoloxidase were 545.67, 731.00, 700.00, and 799.67 u/mg, respectively, compared with control 669.67 u/mg. The activity levels of α-esterase were 9.71, 10.32, 8.91, and 10.55 mg α-naphthol/min/mg protein, respectively. It could be concluded that the AJ-NE and PP-NE nanoformulations have promising larvicidal activity and could act as safe and effective alternatives to chemical insecticides.",

Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting are the most common deliberating side effects and critical concerns of pediatric oncology nurses among those children. AIM: To investigate the effect of peppermint inhalation versus Swedish massage on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in children with leukemia. DESIGN: A multi-arm randomised trial design with three parallel groups. SETTING: This study was conducted at outpatient and inpatient Hematology/leukemia Units at Alexandria University Children's Hospital at Smouha. METHODS: Seventy-five children with leukemia received the first chemotherapy session. They were randomly allocated into three equal groups, 25 children in each group (control, peppermint inhalation, and Swedish massage groups). Every child is assessed for nausea and vomiting before chemotherapy administration and after for three days for consecutive three sessions of treatment. RESULTS: Study findings revealed that children in peppermint inhalation and Swedish massage groups showed significant reduction in mean total score of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting among peppermint inhalation and Swedish groups (15.120 ± 4.585 and 14.680 ± 3.158, respectively) was observed on third chemotherapy session than in control group (45.680 ± 5.793) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that Swedish massage and peppermint inhalation therapies may have significant antiemetic effects as alleviating the chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting for children with leukemia.

Nonpharmacological anxiolytics such as aromatherapy have been studied for their effects on preoperative anxiety, but no placebo-controlled study of aromatherapy during surgeries under MAC has yet been performed. Methods: After IRB approval, 70 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either a lavender/peppermint aromatherapy patch (Elequil Aromatabs®; Beekley Corporation) or a matching placebo patch. The primary outcome, time to readiness for discharge from postoperative acute care units (PACU; min), was assessed every 15 min until a modified postanesthesia recovery score for ambulatory patients (PARSAP) score of 18 or higher was reached. In the preoperative holding area, the assigned patch/placebo was activated and affixed to a folded towel placed aside the subject's head, contralateral to the side of the planned surgery. The towel and patch/placebo were discarded when the subject left the operating room (OR). Results: No difference was found between the treatment and placebo groups on the primary outcome of time to discharge readiness (mean [standard deviation, SD]: 82 [15] vs. 89 [21] min, respectively, p = 0.131). No difference was found between the treatment and placebo groups on the secondary outcomes of intraoperative midazolam dose, intraoperative opioid dose, intraoperative ondansetron dose, or intraoperative promethazine dose. No difference was found between the treatment and placebo groups in the proportion of subjects requiring rescue postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) medication in the PACU or the proportion of subjects requiring opioids in the PACU. No difference was found between the treatment and placebo groups in pain intensity in PACU, average PONV score in PACU, or patient satisfaction in PACU. PACU patient satisfaction was high for both the patch and placebo groups (35/35 [100%] vs. 32/34 [94%] \"very satisfied,\" p = 0.239).

      "abstract": "Postharvest ripening is correlated to the quality and shelf life of European pear fruit. In this study, the effects of peppermint extract on fruit phenotype, related physiological activities, and aroma components during postharvest ripening of the European pear variety 'Packham's Triumph' were examined. Fruit treated with 2.0 g L-1 peppermint extract for 12 h showed delayed softening by 4 d compared with that of the untreated control group. The peak values of ethylene and respiratory rate in fruit were reduced to a certain extent after peppermint extract treatment; however, the peppermint extract did not delay the occurrence of the respiratory climacteric peak. Peppermint extract treatment also did not significantly increase the content of the characteristic peppermint aroma in pear fruit. Further, widely targeted metabolome analysis revealed 298 significantly different metabolites, with flavonoids (40%) and lipid compounds (15%) accounting for the highest proportion on the first day after treatment. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway result showed significant enrichment in the metabolic pathways of biosynthesis of flavonoid, isoflavonoid, flavone and flavonol, linoleic acid, and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism following peppermint extract treatment. The combined analysis of transcriptome and metabolome data showed significant enrichment in linoleic acid metabolism and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism on the first, third, and fifth days after peppermint extract treatment. This study indicates that peppermint extract mainly affects the pear fruit softening process in the early stage after treatment."

      "abstract": "Pain at the injection site is one of the most common complaints in the clinic and is the most important symptom affecting the quality of life of hemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of this study was to determine the effect and compare the topical application of peppermint and cold compresses on the intensity of pain caused by the insertion of a needle into the fistula of HD patients. In this parallel randomized clinical trial, 99 HD patients were assigned to three groups receiving peppermint, a cold compress, or a control using six blocks. For the peppermint group, 20 min before the needle's insertion, a peppermint gel was used; for the cold compress group, an ice pack was used; and for the control group, the usual method was applied. The patients' pain was assessed with the Visual Analog Scale immediately after the needle's insertion. The results showed that after the intervention, the mean and standard deviation of the pain score in the intervention groups receiving peppermint (4.81 ± 1.13) or a cold compress (4.78 ± 1.13) were significantly less than those of the control group (8.42 ± 1.22) (P <0.001), but there was no statistically significant difference between the peppermint group and the cold compress group (P = 0.91). The use of peppermint, which is a cheap and uncomplicated herbal medicine, and a cold compress, which is easy to use and available, is recommended to reduce the severity of pain caused by venipuncture in HD patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Europe, an herbal medicine containing peppermint oil is widely used in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In Japan, however, no clinical evidence for peppermint oil in IBS has been established, and it has not been approved as a drug for IBS. Accordingly, we conducted a clinical study to confirm the efficacy and safety of peppermint oil (ZO-Y60) in Japanese patients with IBS. METHODS: The study was a multi-center, open-label, single-arm, phase 3 trial in Japanese outpatients with IBS aged 17-60 years and diagnosed according to the Rome III criteria. The subjects were treated with an oral capsule of ZO-Y60 three times a day before meals, for four weeks. The efficacy of ZO-Y60 was evaluated using the patient's global assessment (PtGA), IBS symptom severity score, stool frequency score, stool form score, and physician's global assessment (PGA). The safety of ZO-Y60 was also assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-nine subjects were treated with ZO-Y60. During the four-week administration of ZO-Y60, the improvement rate of the PtGA was 71.6% (48/67) in week 2 and 85.1% (57/67) in week 4. It was also suggested that ZO-Y60 is effective against any type of IBS (IBS with constipation, IBS with diarrhea, and mixed/unsubtyped IBS). The improvement rate of the PGA was 73.1% (49/67) in week 2 and 85.1% (57/67) in week 4, also confirming the efficacy of ZO-Y60. Adverse events were observed in 14 subjects (20.3%), however, none of these adverse events were categorized as serious. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of treatment was confirmed, subjective symptoms were improved, as was observed in previous clinical studies of ZO-Y60 conducted outside of Japan. All adverse reactions were previously known and were non-serious. These findings suggest that peppermint oil may be effective in the Japanese population and that it has an acceptable safety profile.

However, the effect of aromatherapy on the gag reflex caused by the stimulation of the oral cavity is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate whether aromatherapy reduces gag reflexes during oral stimulation. METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind, crossover study, the gag reflexes of 24 healthy individuals (12 females and 12 males; mean age: 34.3 ± 9.5 years) were quantified. A standard saliva ejector was slowly guided down the participant's throat to determine the maximum tolerance of the gag reflex, and the insertion distance was measured to quantify the gag reflex. All individuals participated in an aromatherapy session with peppermint essential oil and a placebo session with distilled water. The gag reflex was quantified before (baseline) and after each session. Another measurement was performed using nitrous oxide/oxygen inhalation as a positive control. RESULTS: Gag reflex values significantly increased after aromatherapy with both peppermint essential oil and placebo compared to baseline values (paired t-test, P < 0.001 and P = 0.014, respectively). The gag reflex value also increased significantly during nitrous oxide/oxygen inhalation (paired t-test, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the increase rate of gag reflex values between the positive control and aromatherapy interventions, but it was significantly lower after the placebo intervention (repeated measures analysis of variance, P = 0.003; post-hoc test, P = 0.83 and P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Aromatherapy with peppermint essential oil has the potential for reducing gag reflex during dental procedures. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered in the University hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry under the code UMIN000050616 (approved 17/03/2023).",

MATERIALS AND METHOD: This study was performed as a randomized controlled trial from September 2022 to June 2023 with 68 patients (34 patients in the experimental group and 34 patients in the control group). A Patient Information Form, the Numerical Pain Rating Scale, and the State Anxiety Inventory were used in the data collection process. The researcher administered the Patient Information Form to the patients before they underwent surgery. The State Anxiety Inventory and the Numerical Pain Rating Scale were administered to the patients after the second hour in the postoperative period. Next, for 10 minutes, only the patients in the experimental group inhaled five drops of peppermint oil dripped on a sterile gauze pad whereas no intervention was administered to the patients in the control group. Then, the State Anxiety Inventory and the Numerical Pain Rating Scale were administered again to the patients in both groups successively after the third and fourth hours in the postoperative period. RESULTS: After the second hour in the postoperative period, the difference between the mean pain or state anxiety levels of the two groups were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). On the other hand, after the third and fourth hours in the postoperative period, the differences between the two groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05).

      "abstract": "Inflammation, a type of the body's defense against injury or infection, causes many chronic disorders including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Therefore, discovering natural compounds with numerous biological activities for the management of inflammation is highly recommended. Out of natural compounds, peppermint and its main component, menthol, has been suggested to possess antiinflammatory potential. Four databases including Web of Sciences, PubMed, Scopus, and Embase were searched to identify articles about peppermint and its antiinflammatory effects up to March 2023. Out of 3805 records screened, 14 articles met the study criteria. The evidence reviewed here proposed peppermint as an antiinflammatory agent. Peppermint may suppress inflammation by activating the AMP-activated protein kinase/unc-51 like kinase 1/nuclear factor-E2 associated factor 2 autophagy pathway, downregulating extracellular signal-regulated kinase-nuclear factor kappa B and mitogen activated protein kinases pathways, attenuating oxidative stress, suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and nitric oxide, and inducing the production of antiinflammatory prostaglandins. Due to the promising antiinflammatory effects of peppermint and the lack of human studies in this regard, future randomized clinical trials examining the effects of peppermint on inflammation and its related maladies are warranted.",

HTCC effectively adjusted wettability of Z-R conjugate, and three-phase contact angle of Z-R/H3:1 was moderate (95.01°). The influencing factors of Pickering emulsion formation, including volume fraction of PO, concentration of Z-R/H, and mass ratio of Z-R to HTCC, were evaluated by droplet size, ζ-potential, microscopic observation, and stability index analysis. Pickering emulsions stabilized by Z-R/H3:1 showed excellent physical stability under heat treatment. Z-R/H nanoparticles adsorbed on the oil-water interface yielded a dense filling layer as a physical barrier to improve the emulsion stability, which was validated by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. After 4 weeks of storage, retention rate of PO in Pickering emulsion stabilized by Z-R/H3:1 remained high (72.1 %). Electronic nose analysis showed that Z-R/H3:1-stabilized emulsion effectively prevented volatilization of PO aroma components. Additionally, PO and Z-R/H nanoparticles provided an additive antioxidant effect of Pickering emulsions against DPPH and ABTS free radicals. In summary, these novel Z-R/H nanoparticle offer promising applications as a stabilizer with great potential in preparing functional Pickering emulsions to improve essential oil delivery.",

In the present study, anthelmintic effects of peppermint (Mentha piperita), lemon (Citrus limon), and tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) essential oils against Dactylogyrus sp. found on the gills of carp were studied using in vitro and in vivo experiments. In in vitro experiments, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 μl/ml concentrations of these essential oils were tested on the parasites and cumulative mortalities were observed to reach 100 % after treatment with peppermint, lemon, and tea tree essential oils of 1 μl/ml concentration in approximately 15, 10 and 2 min, respectively. The in vitro experiments demonstrated that the cumulative mortality of the parasites increased with essential oil concentration and exposure duration. As the concentration of essential oil used increased, the observed mean time to death of parasites decreased. In in vivo experiments, median effective concentrations (EC50) as assessed by in vitro tests for peppermint and lemon essential oils in 5 min exposure and EC50 concentration for tea tree essential oil in 2 min exposure was applied on fish as a single bath and there was a significant decrease in the mean parasite intensities (p<0.05). Antiparasitic efficacies of peppermint, lemon, and tea tree essential oils were determined as 28.23 %, 30.95 %, and 35.31 %, respectively. The tea tree oil was the most effective and peppermint oil was the least effective in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. All three herbal essential oils tested in this study have weak antiparasitic potential against monogenean infections in fish."

The positive effects of aromatherapy sessions with different oils on menopausal symptoms are well known. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an aromatherapy massage with peppermint and lemon essential oil on menopausal symptoms. METHODS: Total 63 menopausal and postmenopausal women were included in this study. Participants were randomly divided into three groups: Menta peppermint (n = 21), Citrus lemon (n = 21), and Placebo (n = 21). The peppermint and lemon essential oils of the intervention groups were diluted with 1.5 % sweet almond oil. Pure sweet almond oil was used in the placebo group. Each participant in the massage groups received a hand and arm massage with the selected oil twice a week for 4 weeks in 30-min sessions. Participants' menopausal symptoms were assessed before and after application using the Menopause Symptoms Rating Scale (MRS). RESULTS: When the differences in the treatment groups according to time were examined, it was found that there were statistically significant differences in lemon (F = 9.561, p = 0.003, η2 = 0.139) and peppermint essential oil (F = 15.687, p = 0.001, η2 = 0.210) groups according to time. The peppermint essential oil group was more effective than the lemon group. In addition, both peppermint and lemon essential oils were effective for somatic symptoms (p < 0.05). For psychological symptoms, only the lemon oil (p = 0.011) proved effective, and for urogenital symptoms, only the peppermint essential oil (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The study found that aromatherapy massage with peppermint and lemon essential oil effectively reduced menopausal symptoms. Peppermint essential oil was more effective than lemon essential oil in reducing the menopausal symptoms. THE CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05677698.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, the exclusive use of commercial anthelmintics for the treatment of gastrointestinal nematode infections in ruminants is less sustainable due to anthelmintic resistance, as well as the problem of drug residues in animal products and the environment. Therefore, an integrated therapeutic approach is needed, including the search for alternatives to synthetic anthelmintic drugs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of using the essential oil of peppermint (Mentha x piperita L.) in the control of gastrointestinal nematodes in sheep. For this purpose, the in vitro and in vivo anthelmintic efficacy of this oil and the toxic effects on the hosts were examined. In the in vitro egg hatch test, ovicidal activity varied from 21.0-90.3% depending on the concentration of essential oil used (0.0125, 0.025, 0.049, 0.195, 0.781, 3.125, 12.5, and 50 mg/mL). To some extent, anthelmintic efficacy was confirmed in the in vivo fecal egg count reduction test at a mean dose of 150 mg/kg, with an average reduction of nematode eggs of 26.9 and 46.0% at Days 7 and 14 after treatment, respectively. Furthermore, no toxic effects of applied oil were observed on sheep behavior, kidney, or liver function. The main compounds identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyzes were menthol (32.6%), menthone (22.0%), menthyl-acetate (10.0%), and isomenthone (9.39%). Due to their complex chemical compositions, numerous bioactive ingredients, and natural origin, herbal formulations represent a potentially valuable alternative for the control of gastrointestinal nematodes in sheep. In this context, the results of the present study showed that peppermint essential oil is one of the promising candidates. Further studies should be performed to collect more data on the safety profile of M. piperita EO in treated animals to find the most appropriate formulation for use in field conditions and to test it against resistant gastrointestinal nematode populations."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of inhaling peppermint essence on pain relief and sleep quality after open-heart surgery. METHODS: In a double-blind randomised clinical trial carried out in Iran in 2020, 64 cardiac patients were selected by convenience sampling and randomly allocated to aromatherapy (n=32) and placebo (n=32) groups. The aromatherapy and control groups received inhaled aromatherapy using peppermint essence and distilled water, respectively. Data gathering tools were the Numeric Pain Rating Scale and St Mary's Hospital Sleep Questionnaire. Data were analysed using an independent t-test, χ2 test, Mann-Whitney U test and generalised estimating equation analysis. RESULTS: The mean severity of pain in the aromatherapy and placebo groups was 3.22±0.88 and 4.56±0.90, respectively, which was a statistically significant difference (p=0.0001). The mean sleep scores after the intervention on day 1 were 20.10±4.90 and 25.76±6.36 in the aromatherapy and placebo groups, respectively, and 18.63±5.56 and 22.62±5.69, respectively, on day 2. The difference between the two groups was statistically significantly different after the intervention in terms of sleep quality (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Aromatherapy attenuated pain and improved sleep quality after open-heart surgery. Peppermint essence aromatherapy is therefore recommended after surgery.",

      "abstract": "Establishing efficient methods to combat bacterial biofilms is a major concern. Natural compounds, such as essential oils derived from plants, are among the favored and recommended strategies for combatting bacteria and their biofilm. Therefore, we evaluated the antibiofilm properties of peppermint oil as well as the activities by which it kills bacteria generally and particularly their biofilms. Peppermint oil antagonistic activities were investigated against Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Salmonella Typhimurium on four food contact surfaces (stainless steel, rubber, high-density polyethylene, and polyethylene terephthalate). Biofilm formation on each studied surface, hydrophobicity, autoaggregation, metabolic activity, and adenosine triphosphate quantification were evaluated for each bacterium in the presence and absence (control) of peppermint oil. Real-time polymerase chain reaction, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and field-emission scanning electron microscopy were utilized to analyze the effects of peppermint oil treatment on the bacteria and their biofilm. Results showed that peppermint oil (1/2× minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC], MIC, and 2× MIC) substantially lessened biofilm formation, with high bactericidal properties. A minimum of 2.5-log to a maximum of around 5-log reduction was attained, with the highest sensitivity shown by V. parahaemolyticus. Morphological experiments revealed degradation of the biofilm structure, followed by some dead cells with broken membranes. Thus, this study established the possibility of using peppermint oil to combat key foodborne and food spoilage pathogens in the food processing environment.",

The current study describes the development and optimization of a new type of glycerosome (S-glycerosome) that is formed in glycerol solution with β-sitosterol as the stabilizer. Moreover, the transdermal permeation properties of lappaconitine (LA)-loaded S-glycerosomes and peppermint oil (PO)-mediated S-glycerosomes (PO-S-glycerosomes) are evaluated, and the lipid alterations in the stratum corneum are analyzed via lipidomics. The LA-loaded S-glycerosomes prepared by the preferred formulation from the uniform design have a mean size of 145.3 ± 7.81 nm and an encapsulation efficiency of 73.14 ± 0.35%. Moreover, the addition of PO positively impacts transdermal flux, peaking at 0.4% (w/v) PO. Tracing of the fluorescent probe P4 further revealed that PO-S-glycerosomes penetrate deeper into the skin than S-glycerosomes and conventional liposomes. Additionally, treatment with PO-S-glycerosomes alters the isoform type, number, and composition of sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, and fatty acids in the stratum corneum, with the most notable effect observed for ceramides, the main component of sphingolipids. Furthermore, the transdermal administration of LA-loaded PO-S-glycerosomes improved the treatment efficacy of xylene-induced inflammation in mice without skin irritation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the feasibility of β-sitosterol as a stabilizer in glycerosomes. Additionally, the inclusion of PO improves the transdermal permeation of S-glycerosomes, potentially by altering the stratum corneum lipids.",

      "abstract": "Mentha x piperita is a major source of secondary metabolites (SMs), and developing tools to enhance these compounds would be beneficial to meet the increasing demand in the industry. Elicitation by plant hormones became a new strategy to reach this goal. Three experiments in a climatic chamber and two experiments in an open field were conducted with peppermint to explore the effect of methyl jasmonate (MeJa) on the essential oil (EO) content, EO composition, and the total phenolic content (TPC). The treatment was applied for all experiments by spraying the aerial parts of the plants with a dosage of 2 mM MeJa twice. The treatment influenced all the parameters studied in the trials. The volatile content increased by 9-35%; however, in one trial it remained unchanged. The treatment also affected the main compounds of the EO. Menthone increased significantly in two trials while pulegone and menthofuran decreased. In the case of menthol, the change may also be influenced by the phenological and developmental stages of the plants. In the majority of cases, the TPC was also elevated considerably due to the treatments. MeJa treatments may have promising effects in influencing the accumulation of biologically active compounds and the quality of the drug; therefore, further systematic studies are needed to optimize the technology in vivo."

In addition to these established medications, herbal ingredients have been used over centuries to help treat common cold symptoms. The Ayurveda and Jamu systems of medicine, originating from India and Indonesia, respectively, have leveraged herbal therapies to treat many illnesses. METHOD: An expert roundtable discussion comprising specialists in Ayurveda, Jamu, pharmacology and surgery along with a literature review was conducted to evaluate the use of four herbs - ginger, liquorice, turmeric and peppermint - for common cold symptom management in Ayurvedic texts, Jamu publications and monographs from the World Health Organization, Health Canada and various European guidelines. DISCUSSION: Due to a lack of antivirals, common cold management revolves around maintaining personal hygiene and symptom management. Herbal medicines have been an integral part of many cultures worldwide. Despite its growing acceptance, there is a perception that healthcare providers lack interest and may prevent patients from discussing the use of herbal medicines. Limited education and training may also widen the communication gap between patients and healthcare providers, hindering effective management. CONCLUSION: Evaluation of scientific evidence and the standing in international monographs can offer perspectives on the use of herbal medicines for common cold management."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that nanoemulsions prepared with essential oils have significant antimicrobial potential against multidrug-resistant pathogens due to increased chemical stability. Nanoemulsion also promotes controlled and sustained release, which increases their bioavailability and efficacy against multidrug-resistant bacteria. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial, antifungal, antioxidant, and cytotoxicity properties of cinnamon essential oil and peppermint essential oil as nanoemulsions compared to pure forms. For this purpose, analyses of the selected stable nanoemulsions were carried out. METHOD: The droplet sizes and zeta potentials of peppermint essential oil nanoemulsions and cinnamon essential oil nanoemulsions were found to be 154.6±1.42 nm and -17.1±0.68 mV and 200.3±4.71 nm and -20.0±0.81 mV, respectively. Although the amount of essential oil used in nanoemulsions was 25% w/w, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities were found to be more effective compared to pure essential oils. RESULTS: In cytotoxicity studies on the 3T3 cell line, both essential oil nanoemulsions showed higher cell viability than pure essential oils. At the same time, cinnamon essential oil nanoemulsions exhibited a higher antioxidant property than peppermint essential oil nanoemulsions and showed superiority in the antimicrobial susceptibility test conducted against four bacteria and two fungi. Cell viability tests determined that cinnamon essential oil nanoemulsions showed considerably higher cell viability compared to pure cinnamon essential oil. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that the prepared nanoemulsions in the current study might positively influence the dosing regimen and clinical outcomes of antibiotic therapy.",

However, the related studies report controversial results, and the mechanisms remain unclear. Here we found that inhalation of peppermint essential oil significantly extended the exhaustion time in rats subjected to 2-week weight-bearing swimming training. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a 2-week weight-loaded forced swimming regimen. Prior to each swimming session, the rats were administered peppermint essential oil via inhalation. An exhaustive swimming test was performed at the end of the protocol. Rats treated with essential oil had significantly extended time to exhaustion compared with exercised rats without essential oil treatment. In addition, treated rats also showed reduced oxidative damage induced by endurance exercise. Notably, the rats receiving two-week essential oil inhalation while not subjected to swimming training did not show improved exercise performance. The findings demonstrate that repeated inhalation of peppermint essential oil enhances the effects of endurance training and improves exercise performance partially by preventing oxidative damage.",

      "abstract": "Ascites syndrome occurs in growing broiler chickens in all parts of the world, which is one of the important causes of losses in many flocks, and its prevalence has been seen mostly in meat herds. The most important factor in the occurrence of ascites syndrome is the lack of oxygen in body tissues (hypoxia). Increasing the growth rate requires increasing the volume of blood flowing in the body to deliver nutrients to the organs and expel gases and metabolic products. Therefore, this experiment was conducted to compare the effect of peppermint extract and probiotics on the biochemical factors of the blood of chickens caused by ascites. The treatments were divided into 8 groups of 7 male chickens with 3 repetitions in each group at 21 days. The experimental treatments included control and treatments of peppermint, probiotic, peppermint and probiotic, induced ascites, induced ascites and peppermint, induced ascites and probiotics, induced ascites and peppermint and probiotics. At the end of 42 days, the blood factors of uric acid, triglyceride, glucose, cholesterol, ALT, ALP, and AST were measured by blood sampling. The experimental treatments significantly affected the investigated traits (P<0.05). Considering that in the treatment of induced ascites+ peppermint compared to the treatment of induced ascites, weight gain was significant, and in the blood factors of cholesterol, triglyceride, uric acid, glucose, and functional liver enzymes including ALT, AST, ALP recorded a significant decrease. Therefore, the effectiveness of peppermint extract in improving induced ascites in chickens was determined. Peppermint extract had a positive effect on induced ascites and improved the performance indicators of broiler chickens, and this extract can be used as a preventive of ascites.",

Peppermint is a perennial herb common in Europe and North America. The active ingredient of peppermint oil is menthol and has various gastroenterological and non-gastroenterological uses, especially in the context of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). METHODS: We conducted a literature search on the main medical databases for original articles, reviews, meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials, and case series using the following keywords and acronyms and their associations: peppermint oil, gastro-intestinal motility, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, gastrointestinal sensitivity and gastrointestinal endoscopy. RESULTS: Peppermint oil and its constituents exert smooth muscle relaxant and anti-spasmodic effects on the lower esophageal sphincter, stomach, duodenum, and large bowel. Moreover, peppermint oil can modulate visceral and central nervous system sensitivity. Taken together, these effects suggest using peppermint oil both for improved endoscopic performance and for treating functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. Importantly, peppermint oil has an attractive safety profile compared to classical pharmacological treatments, especially in FGIDs. CONCLUSION: Peppermint oil is a safe herbal medicine therapy for application in gastroenterology, with promising scientific perspectives and rapidly expanding use in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "As one of the most toxic environmental pollutants, cadmium (Cd) has lastingly been considered to have negative influences on plant growth and productivity. Recently, increasing studies have shown that low level of Cd exposure could induce hormetic effect which benefits to plants. However, the underlying mechanisms of Cd-triggered hormesis are poorly understood. In this study, we found that Cd stress treatment showed a hormetic effect on peppermint and Cd treatment with 1.6 mg L-1 concertation manifested best stimulative effects. To explore the hormesis mechanisms of Cd treatment, comparative transcriptome analysis of peppermint young plants under low (1.6 mg L-1) and high (6.5 mg L-1) level of Cd exposure at 0 h, 24 h and 72 h were conducted. Twelve of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected for qRT-PCR validation, and the expression results confirmed the credibility of transcriptome data. KEGG analysis of DEGs showed that the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and photosynthesis were important under both low and high level of Cd treatments. Interestingly, GO and KEGG analysis of 99 DEGs specifically induced by low level of Cd treatment at 72 h indicated that these DEGs were mainly involved in the pathway of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and their functions were associated with antioxidant activity. The expression pattern of those genes in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and encoding antioxidant enzymes during 72 h of Cd exposure showed that low level of Cd treatment induced a continuation in the upward trend but high level of Cd treatment caused an inverted V-shape. The changes of physiological parameters during Cd exposure were highly consistent with gene expression pattern. These results strongly demonstrate that low level of Cd exposure constantly enhanced antioxidant activity of peppermint to avoid oxidative damages caused by Cd ion, while high level of Cd stress just induced a temporary increase in antioxidant activity which was insufficient to cope with lasting Cd toxicity. Overall, the results presented in this study shed a light on the underlying mechanisms of the Cd-mediated hormesis in plant. Moreover, our study provided a safe method for the efficient utilization of mild Cd-contaminated soil as peppermint is an important cash plant."

Psychosocial disorders have been demonstrated to increase postoperative pain and opioid consumption by up to 50%. This study was designed to assess the effectiveness of Aromatherapy in controlling postoperative pain and opioid in anxious patients. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted on anxious patients who underwent primary unilateral total hip arthroplasty. After obtaining signed informed consent, each patient was asked to complete a PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) anxiety survey. Patients whose T score were >57.2 were randomized to either an active treatment (Lavender Peppermint Elequil® aromatab®) or a placebo Elequil®-aromatab® treatment. Demographics, pain, opioid consumption, PONV, and psychosocial surveys were collected on Postoperative Day POD1, POD2, POD7 and POD30. At the time of discharge and on POD30, each patient was asked to complete a satisfaction questionnaire, and they were asked to complete an SF12 survey on POD30. Difference between means was assessed using absolute standardized mean differences. RESULTS: Sixty patients were included in the intend-to-treat analysis. Use of lavender and peppermint was associated with a decrease of 26% in pain (POD7; 0.46), 33% in opioid consumption (POD2; 0.42), and 48% in acetaminophen consumption (POD7; 0.54) and a 78% decrease in PONV (POD2; 0.44). Psychosocial scores decreased following surgery (p=0.001). Overall satisfaction ratings at discharge were similar, as were functional recovery scores. DISCUSSION: Our data provides evidence that in patients with preoperative anxiety, lavender and peppermint aromas decreases postoperative pain and opioid requirement compared to placebo. Additional research is required to conform our data. CONCLUSION: This randomized placebo control study provides evidence of the usefulness of inhalation of lavender and peppermint aromas in patients undergoing primary unilateral total hip arthroplasty."

Efficacy was assessed by meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials. METHODS: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the manufacturer's information system for clinical studies investigating the safety and efficacy of Menthacarin. Efficacy analyses included change from baseline of epigastric pain and general improvement of the patients' condition. RESULTS: Five randomized trials involving 580 patients were found, demonstrating significant effects of Menthacarin on symptoms of functional dyspepsia (FD) compared to placebo or similar effects compared to a reference drug. Seven other studies reported favorable results on therapeutic application in FD patients with concomitant Helicobacter pylori infection, in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and on tolerability in FD patients from 12 years of age. Three trials in FD with 249 patients were eligible for meta-analysis. Results demonstrate a significant reduction in pain intensity (standardized mean difference: 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.39-1.21) and in item 2 of the Clinical Global Impression Scale (risk ratio: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.81-3.87) for Menthacarin. CONCLUSIONS: Menthacarin was shown to be effective and safe for the treatment of FD and represents a promising option for symptoms of IBS.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, the application of sustainable and eco-friendly fertilizers plays an important role in improving the essential oil (EO) quantity and quality of medicinal and aromatic plants. Hence, the study aimed to investigate the effects of green manures, organic manures and biofertilizers on the nutrient content, dry matter yield, EO productivity and quality of peppermint. The treatments included green manures [barley monoculture (Bm), hairy vetch monoculture (HVm) and replacement intercropping of 75%HV + 25%B, 50%HV + 50%B and 25%HV + 75%B], arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and vermicompost (VC). A 50%HV + 50%B green manure appears to be the most effective treatment, since it provides the greatest amount of nutrients (N and K, 18.8 g kg-1, and 18.1 g kg-1, respectively), the tallest plants (61.5 cm), the most nodes per plant (17.5), the lateral branches (24.4), the highest leaf greenness index (45.5) and dry yield (266.7 g m-2) in peppermint. Moreover, this treatment evidenced the larger EO content (1.8%) and EO yield (4.84 g m-2). Regardless of the treatments, the chemical composition of peppermint EO was characterized by menthol (32.35-37.73%), menthone (16.96-20.64%) and 1,8-cineole (6.18-7.78%). The maximum content of menthol and 1,8-cineole was obtained by the application of 50%HV + 50%B. Additionally, the highest content of menthone was observed in AMF treatment. These results indicate that the application of 50%HV + 50%B green manures could be suggested as an environmentally friendly strategy for improving EO quantity and quality of peppermint."

      "abstract": "Irrational use of pesticides may lead to physiological and metabolic disorders in different crops. However, there are limited investigations on impacts of insecticides on physiology and biochemistry, secondary metabolic pathways, and associated quality of medicinal plants such as peppermint (Mentha × piperita L.). In this study, target metabolites in peppermint were monitored following foliar spraying of five insecticides: imidacloprid, pyriproxyfen, acetamiprid, chlorantraniliprole, and chlorfenapyr. Compared with the control, all insecticide treatments caused a significant loss of soluble protein (decreased by 22.3-38.7%) in peppermint leaves. Insecticides induced an increase in the levels of phytohormones jasmonic acid and abscisic acid in response to these chemical stresses. Among them, imidacloprid increased jasmonic acid by 388.3%, and pyriproxyfen increased abscisic acid by 98.8%. The contents of phenylpropanoid metabolites, including rutin, quercetin, apigenin, caffeic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, ferulic acid, syringic acid, and sinapic acid showed a decreasing trend, with pyriproxyfen decreasing the levels of quercetin and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid by 78.8% and 72.6%, respectively. Combined with correlation analysis, the content of lignin in leaves shows different degrees of negative correlations with several phenolic acids. It could be inferred that insecticides may trigger plant defense mechanisms that accumulate lignin (increased by 24.6-49.1%) in leaves by consuming phenolic acids to barricade absorption of insecticides. Through constructing networks between phytohormones and secondary metabolites, peppermint may regulate the contents of caffeic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and sinapic acid by the antagonistic effect between salicylic acid and abscisic acid in response to insecticidal stresses. Principal component analysis and systemic cluster analysis revealed that the most pronounced changes in physiological indexes and metabolites were caused by the pyriproxyfen treatment. In conclusion, this study improves our understanding of the mechanism by which insecticides affect plant physiological and metabolic processes, thus potentially altering the quality and therapeutic value of peppermint as an example.",

Mentha contains various constituents that are classified as peppermint essential oil (PEO) and non-essential components. PEO, consisting mainly of menthol, menthone, neomenthol and iso-menthone, is a mixture of volatile metabolites with anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, scolicidal, immunomodulatory, antitumor, neuroprotective, antifatigue and antioxidant activities. Mounting evidence indicates that PEO may pharmacologically protect gastrointestinal, liver, kidney, skin, respiratory, brain and nervous systems, and exert hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects. Clinically, PEO is used for gastrointestinal and dermatological diseases, postoperative adjuvant therapy and other fields. This review aims to address the advances in the extraction and isolation of PEO, its biological activities, pharmacological effects, toxicity and applications, with an emphasis on the efficacy of PEO on burn wounds and psoriasis, providing a comprehensive foundation for research, development and application of PEO in future.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common disorders of gut-brain interaction, with a complex pathophysiology. Antispasmodics are prescribed as first-line therapy because of their action on gut dysmotility. In this regard, peppermint oil also has antispasmodic properties. AIM: To update our previous meta-analysis to assess efficacy and safety of peppermint oil, particularly as recent studies have cast doubt on its role in the treatment of IBS METHODS: We searched the medical literature up to 2nd April 2022 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of peppermint oil in IBS. Efficacy and safety were judged using dichotomous assessments of effect on global IBS symptoms or abdominal pain, and occurrence of any adverse event or of gastro-oesophageal reflux. Data were pooled using a random effects model, with efficacy and safety reported as pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: We identified 10 eligible RCTs (1030 patients). Peppermint oil was more efficacious than placebo for global IBS symptoms (RR of not improving = 0.65; 95% CI 0.43-0.98, number needed to treat [NNT] = 4; 95% CI 2.5-71), and abdominal pain (RR of abdominal pain not improving = 0.76; 95% CI 0.62-0.93, NNT = 7; 95% CI 4-24). Adverse event rates were significantly higher with peppermint oil (RR of any adverse event = 1.57; 95% CI 1.04-2.37). CONCLUSIONS: Peppermint oil was superior to placebo for the treatment of IBS, but adverse events were more frequent, and quality of evidence was very low. Adequately powered RCTs of peppermint oil as first-line treatment for IBS are needed.",

Therefore, we decided to use a mint drop to improve bowel function after cesarean section. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 102 women enrolled in the study. The patients were simply randomized and double blindly divided into two groups of 51 patients and giving them medication (mint drops) or placebo. Then, the initial evaluation included hearing the first bowel sound, having nausea and vomiting, the first gas passing feeling time, the first defecation feeling time, and duration of hospitalization was evaluated and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The mean time to hearing the first intestinal sounds was 9/05 ± 2/44 hours in the placebo group and 5/78 ± 1/25 hours in the treatment group. The interval between surgery and the first gas passing feeling time in the placebo group was 12/24 ± 3/91 hours and in the treatment group was 7/87 ± 2/02 hours. None of the patients had nausea and vomiting. CONCLUSION: Considering the significant difference between two groups in the meantime interval to hearing the first intestinal sound, the first gas passing feeling time, and the first defecation feeling time, we conclude that the peppermint drop is more effective than placebo in improving bowel function."

The Clule method was used to determine the phytochemical content. An in vitro antioxidant with radical scavenging activity was measured using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. An in vivo antioxidant with oxidative stress reduction was carried out for 10 days on 25 male Sprague-Dawley rats (divided into five groups). Every day, each group was given positive control, negative control, 5, 10, and 20 mg/200 gr of body weight (BW) of the extract. The blood plasma was taken for malondialdehyde analysis. A phytochemical identification of PEE revealed more compounds, such as flavonoids, alkaloids, steroids, essential oils, and tannin. PEE exhibits significant in vitro radical scavenging activity, with an IC50 value of 126.695 µg/mL. In the in vivo antioxidant with oxidative stress reduction experiments, 5 mg/200 gr BW was the most effective dose, as evidenced by a considerable drop in malondialdehyde level (0.312 nmol/mL) after and before treatment. In conclusion, PPE has the potential to be developed as a herbal antioxidant based on in vitro and in vivo test results."

All four FC-GB treatments reduced weight loss and maintained firmness during storage when compared to uncoated FC-GB. Furthermore, all treatments showed higher total chlorophyll content, AsA, total phenolic compounds, and total sugars compared to the control. The best treatment for reducing microbial growth was a combination of Cs + AsA. Additionally, the combination of Cs with TTO, PMO, or AsA showed a significant reduction in the browning index and increased the antioxidant capacity of FC-GB up to 15 d postharvest."

We investigated the effect of three different doses of PMO on gut microbiome composition. Thirty children (7-12 years of age) with functional abdominal pain provided a baseline stool sample prior to randomization to 180, 360, or 540 mg of enteric coated PMO (10 participants per dose). They took their respective dose of PMO (180 mg once, 180 mg twice, or 180 mg thrice daily) for 1 week, after which the stool collection was repeated. Baseline and post-PMO stools were analyzed for microbiome composition. There was no difference in alpha diversity of the gut microbiome between the baseline and post-PMO treatment. Principal coordinate analysis revealed no significant difference in overall bacterial composition between baseline and post-PMO samples, as well as between the PMO dose groups. However, the very low abundant Collinsella genus and three operational taxonomic units (one belonging to Collinsella) were significantly different in samples before and after PMO treatment. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was lower in children who received 540 mg of PMO compared to the 180 mg and 360 mg dose groups (p = 0.04). Network analysis revealed separation between pre- and post-PMO fecal samples with the genus Collinsella driving the post-PMO clusters. PMO administration appeared to impact only low abundance bacteria. The 540 mg PMO dose differentially impacted the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. A higher dose and/or longer duration of treatment might yield different results.",

In each intervention group, patients inhaled 3 drops of lavender or peppermint essential oils. In the control group, patients inhaled 3 drops of aromatic placebo. RESULTS: The results showed the average fatigue decreased in the study groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups of lavender and peppermint in terms of mean fatigue after the intervention. However, there was a statistically significant difference between lavender and control groups (P < 0.001), as well as peppermint and control groups (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Aromatherapy with peppermint and lavender essential oils can reduce the fatigue of cardiac patients, so the use of these fragrances is recommended."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent, chronic gastrointestinal disorder that imposes a substantial socioeconomic burden. Peppermint oil is a frequently used treatment for IBS, but evidence about cost-effectiveness is lacking. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess cost-effectiveness of small-intestinal release peppermint oil versus placebo in IBS patients. METHODS: In a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial, cost-effectiveness was evaluated from a societal perspective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were expressed as (1) incremental costs per Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY), and (2) incremental costs per successfully treated patient, that is per abdominal pain responder (according to FDA definitions), both after an eight-week treatment period with placebo versus peppermint oil. Cost-utility and uncertainty were estimated using non-parametric bootstrapping. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The analysis comprised 126 patients (N = 64 placebo, N = 62 small-intestinal release peppermint oil). Peppermint oil was a dominant treatment compared to placebo in 46% of bootstrap replications. Peppermint oil was also more effective but at higher cost in 31% of replications. The net-benefit acceptability curve showed that peppermint oil has a 56% probability of being cost-effective at a conservative willingness-to-pay threshold of €10.000/QALY. Peppermint oil was also a dominant treatment per additional successfully treated patient according to FDA definitions, that is in 51% of replications. In this case, the acceptability curve showed an 89% probability of being cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with IBS, small-intestinal release peppermint oil appears to be a cost-effective treatment although there is uncertainty surrounding the ICER. When using abdominal pain responder as outcome measure for the ICER, peppermint oil has a high probability of being cost-effective. The use of peppermint oil, which is a low-cost treatment, can be justified by the modest QALY gains and slightly higher proportion of abdominal pain responders. More research and long-term data are necessary to confirm the cost-effectiveness of peppermint oil. NCT02716285.",

      "abstract": "A major challenge for breath research is the lack of standardization in sampling and analysis. To address this, a test that utilizes a standardized intervention and a defined study protocol has been proposed to explore disparities in breath research across different analytical platforms and to provide benchmark values for comparison. Specifically, thePeppermint Experimentinvolves the targeted analysis in exhaled breath of volatile constituents of peppermint oil after ingestion of the encapsulated oil. Data from thePeppermint Experimentperformed by proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) and selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) are presented and discussed herein, including the product ions associated with the key peppermint volatiles, namely limonene,α- andβ-pinene, 1,8-cineole, menthol, menthone and menthofuran. The breath washout profiles of these compounds from 65 individuals were collected, comprising datasets from five PTR-MS and two SIFT-MS instruments. The washout profiles of these volatiles were evaluated by comparing the log-fold change over time of the product ion intensities associated with each volatile. Benchmark values were calculated from the lower 95% confidence interval of the linear time-to-washout regression analysis for all datasets combined. Benchmark washout values from PTR-MS analysis were 353 min for the sum of monoterpenes and 1,8-cineole (identical product ions), 173 min for menthol, 330 min for menthofuran, and 218 min for menthone; from SIFT-MS analysis values were 228 min for the sum of monoterpenes, 281 min for the sum of monoterpenes and 1,8-cineole, and 370 min for menthone plus 1,8-cineole. Large inter- and intra-dataset variations were observed, whereby the latter suggests that biological variability plays a key role in how the compounds are absorbed, metabolized and excreted from the body via breath. This variability seems large compared to the influence of sampling and analytical procedures, but further investigations are recommended to clarify the effects of these factors.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Peppermint oil is often used to treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); however, the overall quality of previous studies is low, and findings have been heterogeneous. This study aimed to compare the effects of peppermint oil vs placebo in relieving IBS symptoms. METHODS: In a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at a single academic center in the United States, individuals diagnosed with IBS (Rome IV criteria), with moderate to severe symptoms based on the IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS score ≥175), were randomized to enteric-coated peppermint oil 180 mg 3 times daily vs placebo in a 1:2 ratio. The primary outcome was mean change in IBS-SSS scores from baseline to 6-week endpoint. RESULTS: A modified intent-to-treat analysis revealed that there were substantial mean improvements from baseline to 6-week endpoint in the main outcome measure (IBS-SSS) for both peppermint oil (90.8, SD = 75.3) and placebo (100.3, SD = 99.6). Although the peppermint oil group reported numerically lower improvement than the placebo group, the effect size was small (d = -0.11), and the difference between the groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.97). Similarly, both groups reported substantial improvements on the secondary endpoints; but again, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups on any of the secondary measures. Sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation to replace missing data produced similar results and revealed no significant differences between peppermint oil and placebo on any outcome measure. DISCUSSION: Peppermint oil and placebo both showed clinically meaningful improvement in IBS symptoms. However, there were no significant differences between the groups. Further large, rigorous trials are needed to evaluate the role of peppermint oil for the treatment of IBS.",

This study aimed to determine the effects of combined inhalation aromatherapy with lemon and peppermint on nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The parallel randomized clinical trial was conducted on 90 pregnant women suffering from nausea and vomiting of pregnancy referred to health centers in Birjand-Iran- from February 2015 to August 2016. Participants were randomly divided into two groups. The combined lemon and peppermint essential oils were used as an inhaler for the intervention and the placebo for the control group. Both groups were trained to place three drops of the solution onto a cotton ball and keep it in a 3-cm distance of their nose. The intensity of nausea, vomiting and fatigue was assessed through 24-hour Pregnancy Unique Quantization of Emesis (PUQE-24) questionnaire and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), respectively. RESULTS: Mean (SD) scores of nausea and vomiting intensity before the intervention and on the first day of intervention were not significantly different between the two groups, but became significant on the second, third, and fourth days of intervention. The results showed that the effect of time on the mean intensity of nausea and vomiting was significant in the aromatherapy group (F2,84 = 22.92, p < 0.001) but was not significant in the placebo group (F2,78 = 0.26, p = 0.836). CONCLUSIONS: The combined lemon and peppermint aromatherapy could reduce mild to moderate intensity of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy."

      "abstract": "The very recent Covid-19 pandemic has made the need to understand biocompatible polymers as support material in drug delivery systems and controlled release clearer, especially for organo-hydrogels. This study aims to synthesize various new polymeric materials called gels, hydrogels, and organo-hydrogels according to the monomer used and to investigate their use as drug release systems. The agar-glycerol (AG) pair was used to synthesize the polymers, N, N, methylene bisacrylamide (MBA, m) and glutaraldehyde (GA, g) were used as cross-linkers and peppermint oil (PmO) was included to obtain the organo-hydrogels. Therefore, one AG gel and two p (AG-m) and p (GA-g) hydrogels were synthesized within the scope of the study. Six different organo-hydrogels based on p(AG-m-PmO) or p (AG-g-PmO) were also synthesized by varying the amount of peppermint oil. Paracetamol and carboplatin were selected as the sample drugs. Synthesized gels, hydrogels and organo-hydrogels were characterized by FTIR and SEM analysis. Additionally, swelling behaviors of the synthesized gels were investigated in different media (ID water, tap water, ethanol, acetone, ethanol/ID water (1:1), acetone/ID water (1:1) and gasoline) and at different pHs. Moreover, it was determined that organo-hydrogels were blood compatible and had antioxidant properties based on hemolysis, blood clotting and antioxidant analysis. Therefore, the release of paracetamol (a known antipyretic-painkiller, recommended and used in the treatment of Covid-19) and carboplatin (widely used in cancer treatment) were studied. Evidently, as the amount of PMO oil increases, the -OH groups in organo-hydrogels will increase and the chemical and physical bonding rates will increase; therefore it was observed that increasing peppermint oil in the organo-hydrogels structure to 0.3 mL stimulated the release of the drugs. For instance, maximum paracetamol release amount from p(AG-g-PmO) and p(AG-m-PmO) organo-hydrogels was calculated to be 72.3% at pH 7.4 and 69.8% at pH 2.0, respectively. The maximum carboplatin release amount from p(AG-g-PmO) and p(AG-m-PmO) organo-hydrogels was calculated to be 99.7% at pH 7.4 and 100% at pH 7.4, respectively. It was concluded that the synthesized organo-hydrogels might easily be used as drug carrier and controlled drug release materials.",

The lack of standardized procedures for collecting and analysing breath samples currently limits its use in clinical practice. In order to overcome this limitation, the 'Peppermint Consortium' was established within the breath community to carry out breath wash-out experiments and define reference values for a panel of compounds contained in the peppermint oil capsule. Here, we present a needle trap micro-extraction technique coupled with gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry for a rapid and accurate determination of alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, limonene, eucalyptol, menthofuran, menthone, menthol and menthyl acetate in mixed breath samples. Detection limits between 1 and 20 pptv were observed when 25 ml of a humidified standard gas mixture were loaded into a needle trap device at a flow rate of 10 ml min-1. Inter- and intra-day precisions were lower than 15%, thus confirming the reliability of the assay. Our procedure was used to analyse breath samples taken from a nominally healthy volunteer who was invited to swallow a 200 mg capsule of peppermint oil. Six samples were collected at various times within 6 h of ingestion. Analyte concentrations were not affected by the sampling mode (i.e. mixed vs. end-tidal fraction), whereas respiratory rate and exhalation flow rate values slightly influenced the concentration of the target compounds in breath samples.",

DESIGN: A quasi-randomized controlled study. SETTING: Patients were recruited from the ambulatory chemotherapy unit of a public hospital located (Batman, Turkey) between September 2017 and September 2018. INTERVENTIONS: The participants in the intervention group applied one drop the aromatic mixture on the spot between their upper lip and their nose, three times a day for the five days following chemotherapy administration, in addition to the routine antiemetic treatment. Participants in the control group underwent only the routine antiemetic treatment. Main outcome measures VAS-the severity of nausea and the Index of Nausea, Vomiting, and Retching. RESULTS: The VAS nausea score was significantly lower after peppermint oil applying in the patients receiving Folfirinox (treatment effect (mean dif.): 4.00±2.28; P<0.001), Paclitaxel-Trastuzumab (treatment effect (mean dif.): 1.70±0.90; P=0.014), Carboplatin-Paclitaxel (treatment effect (mean dif.): 3.71±1.41; P<0.001), and Cyclophosphamide-Adriamycin (treatment effect (mean dif.): 1.41±0.73; P=0.005) excluding cisplatin scedule (treatment effect (mean dif.): 0.56±2,18; P=0.642). We detected a statistical significant difference in the change in frequency of nausea, vomiting, retching in the other all schedules excluding cisplatin schedule (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The peppermint oil was significantly reduced the frequency of nausea, vomiting, retching and the severity of nausea in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.

Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium that has been strongly associated with halitosis. In this study, essential oils (EO) from three plants, Labrador tea (Rhododendron groenlandicum [Oeder] Kron & Judd), peppermint (Mentha x piperita L.), and winter savory (Satureja montana L.), were investigated for their effects on growth, biofilm formation and killing, and VSC production by F. nucleatum. Moreover, their biocompatibility with oral keratinocytes was investigated. Using a broth microdilution assay, winter savory EO and to a lesser extent Labrador tea and peppermint EO showed antibacterial activity against F. nucleatum. A treatment of pre-formed biofilms of F. nucleatum with EO also significantly decreased bacterial viability as determined by a luminescence assay monitoring adenosine triphosphate production. The EO were found to permeabilize the bacterial cell membrane, suggesting that it represents the target of the tested EO. The three EO under investigation were able to dose-dependently reduce VSC production by F. nucleatum. Lastly, no significant loss of cell viability was observed when oral keratinocytes were treated with the EO at concentrations effective against F. nucleatum. This study supports the potential of Labrador tea, peppermint, and winter savory EO as promising agents to control halitosis and promote oral health."

The present study aimed to determine the effect of peppermint extract on the severity of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Methods and Materials: In this randomized controlled trial, we selected 84 patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. They were then assigned to 2 groups of experimental and control (n = 42, each) using block randomization. Patients in the experimental group received 40 drops of peppermint extract mixed in 20 cc of tap water every 8 hours, while patients in the control group received 40 drops of distilled water mixed in 20 cc of tap water every 8 hours. The severity of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia was measured and recorded before the intervention, and immediately, 24 and 48 hours after the chemotherapy using the Visual Analogue Scale. Statistical analysis of the data was conducted using SPSS software version 21. Results: The results of the present study revealed that there was a significant difference between the 2 groups at 24 and 48 hours after the chemotherapy (P < .05), so that the mean score of the severity of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia in the experimental group was lower than in the control group (P < .05). Conclusion: The use of peppermint as a method in complementary medicine may improve nausea, vomiting, and anorexia in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.

Patients rated nausea 0 to 10 on the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale at symptom onset and within 60 minutes of the intervention. RESULTS: Only three subjects enrolled in the antiemetic arm; thus this arm was eliminated from analysis, resulting in 100 evaluable patients. Mean nausea score improved significantly for the entire sample following the aromatherapy or aromatherapy/antiemetic intervention (p < .0001). Patients in the aromatherapy arm had significant improvement in nausea compared to the combined aromatherapy/antiemetic arm (p < .0001). Patient perception that peppermint oil relieves N/V significantly improved for the entire sample. Notable is that 65% of patients used peppermint essential oil alone. CONCLUSIONS: Peppermint essential oil is an effective independent or complementary modality for relief of N/V in hospitalized patients. Research designs that incorporate patient decision making should be considered for studies in which placebos do not contribute to holistic care.",

      "abstract": "Background Postoperative nausea and vomiting are common in patients who underwent cardiac surgery. This study aimed to examine the effect of peppermint essential oil inhalation on the postoperative nausea and vomiting after cardiac surgery. Methods In this clinical trial study, 60 cardiac surgery patients were divided into control and intervention groups. The intervention group underwent nebulizer aromatherapy with peppermint essential oil before the endotracheal tube was removed after surgery. Patients' nausea and vomiting were then assessed through a checklist. The independent-samples t-test, chi-square, and Generalized estimating equation were used for data analysis. Results Totally 85.7% of the patients undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The two groups did not significantly differ in terms of their baseline demographic and clinical variables (P > 0.05). Significant differences were found between the intervention and control groups in terms of the frequency of nausea (0.63 ± 0.81 vs. 1.46 ± 1.21), its duration (3.78 ± 5.09 vs. 7.97 ± 5.55 min), and severity (2.43 ± 2.84 vs. 4.61 ± 2.85), and in the frequency of vomiting episodes (0.17 ±.46 vs. 0.73 ±.60) in the first four hours after extubation (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Peppermint essential oil inhalation has beneficial effects on reducing nausea and vomiting after open-heart surgery. Using peppermint essential oil inhalation for managing postoperative nausea and vomiting is recommended.",

      "abstract": "Microbial contamination of herbal distillates is one of the crucial problems that the market is commonly facing. Spark plasma can be proposed as a potential emerging solution for the decontamination of liquids even with the sensitive aromatic compound like peppermint (Mentha piperita L.) distillate. However, its probable effects on the physicochemical properties of distillate is the main area of concern which will be discussed in the current paper. According to our results, spark plasma with an energy of 2 J/pulse is able to achieve a 4-log reduction in Pseudomonas aeruginosa counts after 4 min of treatment. Various assessments including pH analysis, color measurement, evaluation of essential oil content and composition are employed to determine the likely side effects of the method on the final product. The results show that the plasma processing does not make any sensible changes in the peppermint distillate acidity and color. According to the results, the peppermint essential oil content decreases only about 4% in the samples affected by the plasma, however, content of menthol as the main compound of peppermint distillate reduces about 17%."

However, there is still a lack of benchmarking data that shows the capability of this technique and allows comparability with other breath analysis techniques. In this regard, the goal of this study was the identification of volatile compounds upon ingestion of a specific peppermint oil capsule to get benchmark data for real-time breath analysis with SESI-HRMS. This was done in the framework of a consortium set up by the International Association of Breath Research (IABR), aimed at comparing several analytical instruments for breath analysis. Breath temporal profiles of two subjects were analyzed with SESI-HRMS before and after ingestion of a peppermint oil capsule. The measurements were performed at two different locations using identical SESI-HRMS platforms to allow for comparability and benchmarking. Remarkably, along with the four major compounds (monoterpenes/cineole, menthone, menthofuran and menthol) reported by other members of the consortium, we detected 57 additional features significantly associated (ρ > 0.8) with the peppermint oil capsule, suggesting that this relatively simple intervention might trigger a more complex metabolic cascade than initially expected. This observation was made on both sites. Additional replicate experiments for one of the subjects suggested that a core of 35-40 unique molecules are consistently detected in exhaled breath upon ingestion of the capsule. In addition, we illustrate the analytical capabilities of real-time SESI-HRMS/MS to assist in the identification of unknown compounds. The results outlined herein showcase the performance of SESI-HRMS and enable comparison with other breath analysis techniques. Along with that, they strengthen the potential of this analytical technique for non-invasive drug monitoring and clinical diagnostic purposes.",

      "abstract": "Sampling of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) has shown promise for detection of a range of diseases but results have proved hard to replicate due to a lack of standardization. In this work we introduce the 'Peppermint Initiative'. The initiative seeks to disseminate a standardized experiment that allows comparison of breath sampling and data analysis methods. Further, it seeks to share a set of benchmark values for the measurement of VOCs in breath. Pilot data are presented to illustrate the standardized approach to the interpretation of results obtained from the Peppermint experiment. This pilot study was conducted to determine the washout profile of peppermint compounds in breath, identify appropriate sampling time points, and formalise the data analysis. Five and ten participants were recruited to undertake a standardized intervention by ingesting a peppermint oil capsule that engenders a predictable and controlled change in the VOC profile in exhaled breath. After collecting a pre-ingestion breath sample, five further samples are taken at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h after ingestion. Samples were analysed using ion mobility spectrometry coupled to multi-capillary column and thermal desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry. A regression analysis of the washout data was used to determine sampling times for the final peppermint protocol, and the time for the compound measurement to return to baseline levels was selected as a benchmark value. A measure of the quality of the data generated from a given technique is proposed by comparing data fidelity. This study protocol has been used for all subsequent measurements by the Peppermint Consortium (16 partners from seven countries). So far 1200 breath samples from 200 participants using a range of sampling and analytical techniques have been collected. The data from the consortium will be disseminated in subsequent technical notes focussing on results from individual platforms.",

In this study, peppermint powder was used as a feed additive to evaluate growth performance, hematological parameters, protein profile of skin mucus, and immune parameters, as well as growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) gene expression in Caspian roach (Rutilus caspicus). The fingerlings (average weight of 2.40 ± 0.12 g) were fed with diet containing 0 (control), 2, 3, and 4 g/kg peppermint for 8 weeks. The addition of peppermint significantly enhanced the growth parameters and decreased the food conversion ratio. Hematological indices of fish fed with peppermint-supplemented diets were significantly different from the control group (P < 0.05). Soluble protein, alkaline phosphatase, and lysozyme enzyme activity in mucus samples showed an incremental trend by increasing the peppermint levels in the diet. Evaluation of mucosal immunity indicated a remarkable difference between the protein profile in treatments fed with peppermint-supplemented diets and the control group. A new protein band (approximately 27 kDa) was also found in the skin mucus of fish fed with the diet containing 4 g/kg peppermint, and the highest band density was observed in this treatment. The highest IGF and GH gene expression were observed in 4 g/kg peppermint treatment. There was a significant difference in HSP70 expression between the fish fed with peppermint powder and the control group (P < 0.05). Overall, the results showed that dietary oral administration of peppermint at 4 g/kg of feed can act as a growth promoter and immunostimulant.",

From the use of single acids moving on to the so-called compound peelings (associations of more than one substance in the same product) and the combined peelings which take advantage of the action of different substances in a synergistic manner (different products are applied sequentially) in order to best guarantee a greater effectiveness of the treatment for the recommended target. Superficial peelings, combined and not, have led to a drastic reduction in the percentage of incidence of adverse events typical of medium and deep peels. Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that superficial peels bring about a rejuvenating effect through the mechanical stimulation of the Skin Stress Response System (SSRS), system designated to repairing the damaged tissue and restoring of the normal homeostasis. Clinical trials aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the peppermint peel (PMP) medical device in subjects with different ageing expressions both in qualitative terms (different blemishes such as discolouration, fine wrinkles, elastosis, atony and skin inelasticity, laxity, scarce superficial hydration) and in quantitative terms (degree, extension and number of lesions). A non-controlled multi-centric clinical trial was done in 121 subjects. The use protocol calls for a session every 2 weeks for a total of 4 sessions. Subjects were evaluated before each subsequent session at the first and at 2-4-8 weeks of the fourth and last treatment. During the study there were no adverse events. Only a minimal scurfy flaking and a very slight redness were reported. From an effectiveness point of view, the percentage of therapeutic failure, judged with a score equal to or greater than 4 or 5 in Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) scale was 0%. Best score was obtained in subjects ranging in ages between 38 and 57 (2.02) and in women (2.02) years, while the less satisfactory one was obtained in males (2.14). The study has demonstrated that PMP and the proposed protocol are effective and safe to treat subject with skin signs of chrono and photo ageing, thanks to its capabilities of carrying out a mechanic action indicated as a coadjuvant in the treatment of the dermoepidermic revitalisation through chemical exfoliation and hydration.",

Regarding the contradictory findings on the effect of aromatherapy with peppermint on the severity of nausea, in the present study, we aimed at comparing the effect of aromatherapy with 10% and 30% peppermint essential oils on the severity of nausea in surgical patients. METHODS: This single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted at the surgical ward of Imam Reza Hospital in Kermanshah, Iran. A total of 120 patients undergoing abdominal surgery were randomly divided into three groups of 10% peppermint, 30% peppermint, and control (40 patients in each group) using a random number table. In each of the intervention groups, 0.2 ml of 10% and 30% peppermint essential oil was inhaled. In the control group, the same amount of distilled water colored with green food coloring was inhaled. The severity of nausea was measured by nausea visual analog scale (NVAS) before and 10 minutes after the intervention. RESULTS: In the 10% peppermint group, the mean severity of nausea before the intervention was 52.3 ± 13.7 out of 100, which reduced to 40.5 ± 13.5 after the intervention (p < 0.001). In the 30% peppermint group, the mean severity scores of nausea before and after the intervention were 60.2 ± 15.0 and 39.7 ± 12.4, respectively (p < 0.001). In the control group, the mean severity scores of nausea before and after the intervention was not statistically significant. There was no significant difference between the two intervention groups in terms of the mean severity of nausea after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that 10% and 30% peppermint essential oils are equally effective on the severity of nausea."

This disorder is most commonly reported in females, with a median age of 60 years. Multiple therapeutic options have been developed for the treatment of DES. There has been limited research regarding the use of peppermint oil in the treatment of DES. Here, we discuss the interesting case of an elderly female patient who received symptomatic relief from peppermint oil."

Patients who experience nausea during chemotherapy may also experience depression, metabolic imbalances, dehydration, decreased ability to function, and treatment delays, which can ultimately affect outcomes. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the efficacy of a cool damp washcloth with peppermint essential oil versus a cool damp washcloth alone on the self-reported intensity of nausea in patients receiving chemotherapy in the outpatient ambulatory setting. METHODS: 79 adult patients receiving chemotherapy were recruited from an outpatient ambulatory infusion center in the southeastern United States. Patients were separated into two groups (no scent and peppermint) and asked to rate the intensity of their chemotherapy-induced nausea at pre- and postintervention using the Baxter Retching Faces pictorial scale. FINDINGS: The results demonstrated that the use of peppermint oil was effective in decreasing the intensity of nausea experienced by patients compared to a cool washcloth alone.",

Many clearing mechanisms may be applied to create good endoscopic visualizations for the upper gastrointestinal tract using mucolytic agents, antifoaming agents, proteolytic enzymes and neutralizers. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of simethicone, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), sodium bicarbonate and peppermint as pre-medications for visualization of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). METHODS: This study was a single center prospective randomized controlled trial. The patients were randomly allocated to one of four treatment groups. Group A: water; Group B: water with simethicone; Group C: water with simethicone plus NAC 600 mg; Group D: water with simethicone, NAC, sodium bicarbonate and peppermint. RESULTS: A total of 128 patients were enrolled and evaluated in this study. Total visibility score (TVS) of Groups A, B, C, and D were 13.4 ± 1.86, 10.5 ± 1.45, 7.15 ± 0.98 and 6.4 ± 1.43, respectively. Group D showed lower TVS than other groups. The procedural durations of Groups C and D were significantly shorter than Group A. The volume of solution for mucosal cleansing of Groups C and D was significantly lower than Groups A and B. CONCLUSIONS: The application of simethicone plus NAC is safe, improves endoscopic visualization and requires a minimal amount of mucosal cleansing solution. The addition of sodium bicarbonate and peppermint further improved visualization for the upper and lower gastric body. Thai Clinical Trials Registry (TCTR) with a reference number; TCTR20190501002.",

However, the potent statistical data to confirm its effects are lacking. This meta-analysis thus aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of POCO compared with placebo in treating patients with FD. We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE (Ovid), Web of Science, Google Scholar, China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, Wanfang, and VIP databases for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) up to June 2019. Dichotomous data were shown as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All data were analyzed by Review Manager 5.2 software. The search identified 382 citations, and 5 RCTs (578 participants) were included. POCO showed a statistically significant effect in global improvement of FD symptoms (RR for not much or very much improvement 0.59, 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.71, P < 0.00001, I 2 36%, NNT 3) and improvement in epigastric pain (RR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.28 to 2.03, P < 0.0001, I 2 0%, NNT 3). There were no significant differences in the total number of adverse events between POCO and placebo (NNH 40). In conclusion, this is the first meta-analysis to assess the effects of POCO in FD. POCO is an effective and safe short-term treatment for FD. However, current findings are based on smaller sample sizes and low/very low quality of the evidence. More well-designed RCTs with large sample sizes of FD patients are required."

DESIGN: This double blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial study was conducted on 150 patients with head trauma admitted to the ICU. Using sealed envelopes, patients were assigned randomly into two intervention (n = 75) and control (n = 75) groups. SETTING: The study was conducted in the ICUs of a university hospital and a general hospital in Shiraz, Iran. INTERVENTION: The intervention group received peppermint gel three times a day up to 14 days during the skin care as a layer on the skin areas exposed to the risk of pressure injuries. The control group used a placebo gel. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: The expected outcome in this study was the incidence of pressure injuries stage I, which once daily was evaluated by pairs of observers with the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel. RESULTS: The incidence rate of pressure injuries was 22.8% and 77% in the intervention and the control groups, respectively. The chi-square test result showed a significant deference between two groups (P < 0.001). Sacrum was the most common site for incidence of the pressure injuries. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that the peppermint gel has a positive effect in the prevention of pressure injuries in the patients with head trauma admitted to ICUs. So, the use of this gel is suggested as an easy and low-cost method for prevention of pressure injuries in the patients admitted to ICUs.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Peppermint oil is frequently used to treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), despite a lack of evidence for efficacy from high-quality controlled trials. We studied the efficacy and safety of small-intestinal-release peppermint oil in patients with IBS and explored the effects of targeted ileocolonic-release peppermint oil. METHODS: We performed a double-blind trial of 190 patients with IBS (according to Rome IV criteria) at 4 hospitals in The Netherlands from August 2016 through March 2018; 189 patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis (mean age, 34.0 years; 77.8% female; 57.7% in primary care), and 178 completed the study. Patients were randomly assigned to groups given 182 mg small-intestinal-release peppermint oil, 182 mg ileocolonic-release peppermint oil, or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was abdominal pain response, as defined by the US Food and Drug Administration: at least a 30% decrease in the weekly average of worst daily abdominal pain compared with baseline in at least 4 weeks. The co-primary endpoint was overall relief of IBS symptoms, as defined by the European Medicines Agency. Secondary endpoints included abdominal pain, discomfort, symptom severity, and adverse events. RESULTS: Abdominal pain response did not differ significantly between the peppermint oil and placebo groups: 29 of 62 patients in the small-intestinal-release peppermint oil group had a response (46.8%, P = .170 vs placebo), 26 of 63 patients in the ileocolonic-release peppermint oil group had a response (41.3%, P = .385 vs placebo), and 22 of 64 patients in the placebo group had a response (34.4%). We did not find differences among the groups in overall relief (9.7%, P = .317 and 1.6%, P = .351 vs 4.7% for placebo). The small intestinal peppermint oil did, however, produce greater improvements than placebo in secondary outcomes of abdominal pain (P = .016), discomfort (P = .020), and IBS severity (P = .020). Adverse events, although mild, were more common in both peppermint oil groups (P < .005). CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial of patients with IBS, we found that neither small-intestinal-release nor ileocolonic-release peppermint oil (8 weeks) produced statistically significant reductions in abdominal pain response or overall symptom relief, when using US Food and Drug Administration/European Medicines Agency recommended endpoints. The small-intestinal-release peppermint oil did, however, significantly reduce abdominal pain, discomfort, and IBS severity. These findings do not support further development of ileocolonic-release peppermint oil for treatment of IBS. Clinicaltrials.gov, Number: NCT02716285.",

Migraine is prevalent in different geographic areas worldwide. The present study was designed to compare the impact of intranasal lidocaine 4% and peppermint essential oil drop 1.5% on migraine attacks. METHODS: In this double-blind, parallel, randomized controlled trial, 120 adult patients with a diagnosis of migraine based on the International Headache Society criteria were treated with intranasal lidocaine drop 4% or peppermint essential oil drop 1.5% or placebo. Patients expressed their symptoms 5 and 15 min after dripping, and if they still had a headache after 15 min, they were given the second dose. Patients with a second dose of medication, 15 min later recorded their headache rate. All patients recorded their symptoms after 30 min. Symptoms of the patients were followed by a researcher through the phone and in-person after 2 months. Then, the questionnaires were filled. RESULTS: In the present study, there was a significant difference among groups in headache intensity after treatment (P < 0.001). In 40% of the patients in the peppermint oil and lidocaine groups, the intensity of headache decreased. In the placebo group, fewer patients responded highly to the treatment, whereas 41.5% of patients in the lidocaine group and 42.1% of patients in the peppermint oil group responded to the treatment considerably. CONCLUSIONS: Concerning the findings of the present study, nasal application of peppermint oil caused considerable reduction in the intensity and frequency of headache and relieved majority of patients' pain similar to lidocaine. On the basis of findings of this study, it can be concluded that nasal menthol, such as lidocaine, can be used to relieve migraine headaches."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Screening colonoscopy has been associated with reduced mortality from colorectal cancer by means of early detection and timely treatment. However, visualization during colonoscopy is often impaired since the colon is naturally prone to peristalsis and spasm. There is evidence to suggest benefit of topical peppermint oil in causing smooth muscle relaxation, thereby decreasing peristalsis. The aim of our study was to determine if peppermint oil helps reduce colonic spasticity so as to allow for better visualization during screening colonoscopy. METHODS: We performed a randomized controlled, double-blinded, clinical trial where patients undergoing screening colonoscopy were assigned to receive either peppermint oil or placebo. Once cecum was reached, 50 mL of either solution was directly injected via the working channel of the colonoscope. Colonic peristalsis, spasticity and bowel visibility were documented. Bowel preparation quality, withdrawal time and adenoma detection rate (ADR) were also assessed. Continuous variables were analyzed using t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test while categorical variables were compared using the two-way Chi-square test. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were included, of whom 24 patients received peppermint oil and 24 received placebo. Mean Boston bowel preparation score (BBPS) was excellent for both groups (8 points vs. 7.9 points; P = 0.98). Both mean total colonoscopy time (17.8 min vs. 21.9 min; P = 0.07) and mean cecal intubation time (7.2 min vs. 10.3 min; P = 0.04) were shorter with peppermint oil as compared to placebo. Complete absence of bowel spasticity was observed among 58.3% patients in the peppermint oil group as compared to 45.8% patients in the placebo group (P = 0.05). More than 75% of bowel was visualized in 83% of patients in both groups (P = 0.56). Mean ADR was higher in the peppermint group as compared to the placebo group (45.8% vs. 37.5%; P = 0.56). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that topical peppermint oil reduces bowel wall spasticity, which could lead to better visualization of the bowel during screening colonoscopy. Although use of peppermint oil was associated with better ADRs, these results did not achieve statistical significance. Larger sample size and use of alternative methods of peppermint oil administration allowing for more absorption time may establish stronger results."

Therefore, here, we examined the suppressive effects of the extracts from seven edible herbs on the induction of CYP3A4 gene expression in rifampicin-treated HepG2 cells. We evaluated the structure and suppressive activity of the most effective active compound isolated from dried peppermint (Mentha piperita L.). The structure of the compound was identified as that of pheophorbide a based on spectroscopic data. It suppressed the induction of CYP3A4 mRNA expression by rifampicin in a dose-dependent manner. Quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography showed that 2 g of dry leaves 0.43 mg in one cup of peppermint tea. These findings demonstrate that pheophorbide a suppresses the induction of CYP3A4 mRNA expression in rifampicin-treated HepG2 cells. Pheophorbide is known to cause photosensitivity. However, the effective dose of pheophorbide a that had a suppressive effect was very low, indicating a high safety margin.

The present study investigates the effect of weekly drenching applications of 0, 10, 50, 100, or 200 μM omeprazole on Mentha piperita (peppermint) subjected to water stress by watering at 100%, 70%, and 50% of container substrate capacity for 7 weeks in an experiment that spanned two seasons. Peppermint that received higher doses of omeprazole showed increased plant height, leaf number, leaf area, and dry weight under normal and water stress conditions. The amounts of chlorophyll and proline in the leaves as well as gas exchange increased in omeprazole-treated plants relative to the control plants. Omeprazole treatment also resulted in increased activity of the enzymes catalase and ascorbate peroxidase, reduced accumulation of the reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide, increase in the essential oil ratio, and improvement in essential oil composition. Omeprazole-treated plants showed higher ratios of menthol and menthone composition relative to the control plants. The changes in essential oil composition were associated with increased expression of genes associated with the menthol biosynthesis pathway. These findings indicate that omeprazole can ameliorate water stress in peppermint by increasing vegetative and root growth; increasing chlorophyll amount, photosynthetic rate, and gas exchange; reducing water loss by boosting leaf water potential and relative water content; increasing proline content; and modulating the gene expression of secondary metabolites.",

      "abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate effects of dietary peppermint leaves and menthol supplementations on performance, survivability rate, cost economics, meat physicochemical properties, and carcass characteristics of broiler chicks. A total of 384 1-day-old, unsexed Ross 308 broiler chicks, were divided into 2 experiments. Each experiment included 192 birds that were assigned to 4 dietary treatments that included peppermint leaves at concentrations of 0, 5, 10, or 15 g/kg in the first experiment or menthol at concentrations of 0, 26, 52, or 78 mg/kg in the second experiment. Each treatment had 6 replicate pens with 8 birds. The experiments lasted for 35 D. The peppermint leaves contained 1.48% essential oil that contained 35.1% menthol, and the levels of menthol were selected based on the concentrations in peppermint leaf levels. Body weight and body-weight gain increased with the increase in dietary peppermint leaves (linear, P < 0.01) and menthol concentrations (linear, quadratic, P < 0.01) during the trial periods. In addition, the feed intake linearly increased (P < 0.01) with increasing peppermint leaves or menthol levels and, in turn, caused linear improvements (P < 0.01) in feed conversion values. Interestingly, a lower mortality rate was recorded in the supplementation groups and, therefore, a higher net return was observed. However, pH values and drip loss percentage of breast and leg muscles were not affected by either dietary peppermint levels or menthol levels. Increasing peppermint or menthol levels decreased (P < 0.001) cook-loss percentage of breast and leg muscles. On the other hand, dietary supplementation of peppermint leaves or menthol had no effect (P ≥ 0.05) on the relative weights of dressing, breast, leg, liver, heart, gizzard, spleen, or pancreas. Interestingly, abdominal fat percentage was decreased by either supplemental peppermint or menthol. Hence, the present investigation demonstrates that peppermint leaves can be used as an effective novel nutritional bio-agent up to 15 g/kg to improve the performance of broiler chicks, mainly due to its active component.",

AIM: To explore the impact of PO on dysphagia and/or chest pain in patients referred for motility testing. METHODS: Patients initiated on PO for dysphagia and/or chest pain from 2013 to 2016 were identified. We excluded patients with obstructing esophageal lesions, patients lost to follow-up, and those with preexisting cardiac conditions. Concentrated PO was given as commercially available dissolvable peppermint tablets; two tablets before meals were prescribed to patients with dysphagia and on an as-needed basis for patients with chest pain. Patient-reported symptom response was assessed using a modified five-point Likert scale. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were included. Twenty-four patients (63%) reported improvement; 12 were much better and 12 were slightly better. Fourteen experienced no change and none reported feeling worse. Based on pre-treatment HRM, patients with distal esophageal spasm (DES) (n = 10) and esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction (EGJOO) (n = 8) appeared to demonstrate the best subjective improvement (83% and 100%, respectively) (P < 0.05).

The study objective was to determine the effect of peppermint oil in the treatment of the IBS. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.gov, EMBASE (Ovid), and Web of Science for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PO for IBS. We appraised the eligible studies by the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We performed random-effects meta-analysis on primary outcomes including global improvement in IBS symptoms and abdominal pain. A PRISMA-compliant study protocol is registered in PROSPERO Register [2016, CRD42016050917]. RESULTS: Twelve randomized trials with 835 patients were included. For global symptom improvement, the risk ratio (RR) from seven RCTs for the effect of PO (n = 253) versus placebo (n = 254) on global symptoms was 2.39 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.93, 2.97], I2 = 0%, z = 7.93 (p < 0.00001). Regarding abdominal pain, the RR from six RCTs for the effect of PO (n = 278) versus placebo (n = 278) was 1.78 [95% CI: 1.43, 2.20], I2 = 0%, z = 5.23 (p < 0.00001). Overall, there were no differences in the reported adverse effects: PO (32 events, 344 total, 9.3%) versus placebo (20 events, 327 total, 6.1%) for eight RCTs; RR 1.40 [95% CI: 0.87, 2.26] I2 = 0%, z = 1.39 (p = 0.16). The number needed to treat with PO to prevent one patient from having persistent symptoms was three for global symptoms and four for abdominal pain. CONCLUSIONS: In the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date, PO was shown to be a safe and effective therapy for pain and global symptoms in adults with IBS.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Peppermint oil (PO) has been shown to reduce abdominal pain in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). PO is assumed to induce intestinal smooth muscle relaxation and desensitization of nociceptive nerve afferents. To increase colonic PO concentration, an ileocolonic release peppermint oil (IC-PO) capsule has been developed. The aim of this study was to compare pharmacokinetic parameters of the currently available small intestinal release PO (SI-PO) and the novel IC-PO. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, crossover study, subjects received 182 mg of either SI-PO or IC-PO in a crossover design with a washout period of more than 14 days. Blood samples were collected to determine menthol glucuronide concentrations. RESULTS: Eight healthy volunteers (50% female, median age 22) were included. The time to reach the maximum concentration (Tmax) of IC-PO was significantly longer compared to SI-PO with a median (IQR) of 360 (360-405) versus 180 (120-180) min. The lag time (Tlag) was significantly longer with a median (IQR) of 225 (204-284) for IC-PO compared to 37 (6-65) min for SI-PO. The areas under the menthol glucuronide plasma concentration-time curves were significantly smaller with a median (IQR) of 2331 μg h/L (2006-2510) for IC-PO compared to 2623 μg h/L (2471-2920) for SI-PO. No significant differences were found in peak concentrations and elimination half-lives. CONCLUSION: IC-PO has a significantly delayed peak menthol glucuronide concentration and Tlag, both pointing to the release of PO in the more distal part of the intestine. This may enhance therapeutic efficacy as it results in increased exposure of colonic mucosal afferents to the PO. A randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of SI and IC-PO in IBS is currently ongoing.

The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of Aloe vera-Peppermint (Veramin) moisturizing gel on mouth dryness and oral health among patients hospitalized in ICUs. METHODS: This triple-blind two-group randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was undertaken in 2016-2017 on a convenient sample of 80 patients. Patients were randomly allocated to an intervention and a placebo group. Oral care for patients in the intervention and the placebo groups was provided for 5 successive days using Veramin moisturizing gel and a placebo gel, respectively. Data were collected at the 1st, 3rd, and 5th days of the study using a demographic and clinical characteristics questionnaire, the Challacombe scale (for mouth dryness assessment), and the Mucosal-Plaque Index (for oral health assessment). The Chi-square, Fisher Exact, Mann-Whitney U, and Friedman tests were used for data analysis. FINDINGS: In the 5th day, the mean score of mouth dryness in the intervention group was significantly lower than the placebo group (P = 0.0001). On the other hand, in the third and the 5th days, the oral health mean score in the intervention group was significantly lower than the placebo group (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Veramin moisturizing gel is effective in significantly relieving mouth dryness, preventing dental plaque formation, and improving oral health. Thus, it can be used for improving oral care outcomes in ICUs."

Aromatherapy is one of the types of complementary medicine that is used in the treatment of nausea and vomiting. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of aromatherapy with peppermint oil on the severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP). METHODS: This was a single-blind clinical trial that was conducted on 56 pregnant women with mild to moderate severity of NVP and 6 to 20 weeks of gestational age. After the determination of gestational age and base severity of NVP in each woman, they were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: peppermint oil (n=28) or placebo (n=28). Inhalation aromatherapy was done for four days and at the end of each day, they responded to the Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis/Nausea questionnaire (PUQE). The data obtained were analyzed with Mann-Whitney test and ANOVA with repeated measures using SPSS software version 22. Also, the level of significance was p<0.05. RESULTS: Although the severity of NVP in each intervention group significantly decreased (p<0.001), the comparison of the severity of NVP during the study period and at the end of it was not statistically significant between the placebo and intervention groups. CONCLUSION: According to the possibility of neurological mechanisms causing NVP, the effect of aromatherapy with peppermint oil and placebo were the same in this study. This similarity can be due to psychological impacts of intervention on pregnant women."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder associated with altered gastrointestinal microflora and increased nociception to colonic distension. This visceral hypersensitivity can be reversed in our rat maternal separation model by fungicides. Menthacarin® is a proprietary combination of essential oils from Mentha x piperita L. and Carum carvi. Because these oils exhibit antifungal and antibacterial properties, we investigated whether Menthacarin® can reverse existing visceral hypersensitivity in maternally separated rats. METHODS: In non-handled and maternally separated rats, we used the visceromotor responses to colorectal distension as measure for visceral sensitivity. We evaluated this response before and 24 hours after water-avoidance stress and after 7 days treatment with Menthacarin® or control. The pre- and post-treatment mycobiome and microbiome were characterized by sequencing of fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS-1) and bacterial 16s rDNA regions. In vitro antifungal and antimicrobial properties of Menthacarin® were studied with radial diffusion assay. KEY RESULTS: Menthacarin® inhibited in vitro growth of yeast and bacteria. Water-avoidance caused visceral hypersensitivity in maternally separated rats, and this was reversed by treatment. Multivariate analyses of ITS-1 and 16S high throughput data showed that maternal separation, induced changes in the myco- and microbiome. Menthacarin® treatment of non-handled and maternally separated rats shifted the mycobiomes to more similar compositions. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: The development of visceral hypersensitivity in maternally separated rats and the Menthacarin® -mediated reversal of hypersensitivity is associated with changes in the mycobiome. Therefore, Menthacarin® may be a safe and effective treatment option that should be tested for IBS.",

It has been shown to have several effects on gastrointestinal physiology relevant to clinical care and management. AIM: To review the literature on peppermint oil regarding its metabolism, effects on gastrointestinal physiology, clinical use and efficacy, and safety. METHODS: We performed a PubMed literature search using the following terms individually or in combination: peppermint, peppermint oil, pharmacokinetics, menthol, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, gallbladder, colon, transit, dyspepsia, nausea, abdominal pain, and irritable bowel syndrome. Full manuscripts evaluating peppermint oil that were published through 15 July 2017 were reviewed. When evaluating therapeutic indications, only randomised clinical trials were included. References from selected manuscripts were used if relevant. RESULTS: It appears that peppermint oil may have several mechanisms of action including: smooth muscle relaxation (via calcium channel blockade or direct enteric nervous system effects); visceral sensitivity modulation (via transient receptor potential cation channels); anti-microbial effects; anti-inflammatory activity; modulation of psychosocial distress. Peppermint oil has been found to affect oesophageal, gastric, small bowel, gall-bladder, and colonic physiology. It has been used to facilitate completion of colonoscopy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Placebo controlled studies support its use in irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, childhood functional abdominal pain, and post-operative nausea. Few adverse effects have been reported in peppermint oil trials. CONCLUSION: Peppermint oil is a natural product which affects physiology throughout the gastrointestinal tract, has been used successfully for several clinical disorders, and appears to have a good safety profile.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is steadily growing throughout the world. Traditional medicine has an excellent potential in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the potential antidiabetic effect of peppermint essential oil (PEO) on streptozotocin (STZ) and nicotinamide induced diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in rats fasting overnight by the intraperitoneal administration of nicotinamide followed by a single dose of STZ. After 72h, two groups of diabetic rats were treated with different doses of PEO (40 and 80mg/kg BW) respectively and one group was treated with the standard hypoglycemic agent glibenclamide. The levels of blood glucose, serum insulin, and C-peptide were estimated. The markers of oxidative stress were quantified. The samples from liver and pancreas were collected for histological evaluation. Immunohistochemical tests were carried out to determine the expression of Bcl-2 and insulin in the liver and pancreas, respectively. After the treatment with PEO, it was observed that anemia resulting from diabetes was rectified, the counts of leukocytes and platelets, which decreased during diabetes, were increased, the levels of blood glucose were decreased and those of serum insulin and C-peptide were increased. The administration of PEO also enhanced the antioxidant status in the treated rats. The histological analysis revealed regeneration of the hepatic and pancreatic tissues and the extent of degenerative changes were reduced. The immunohistochemical examination revealed upregulation in the expression of Bcl-2 and insulin. These findings demonstrated the potential antidiabetic capability of PEO.",

      "abstract": "Starch nanoparticles (SNPs) and peppermint oil (PO)-loaded SNPs were fabricated via an ultrasonic bottom-up approach using short linear glucan debranched from waxy maize starch. The effects of the glucan concentration, ultrasonic irradiation time, and chain length on the SNPs' characteristics were investigated. Under the optimal conditions, i.e., short linear glucan concentration of 5% and ultrasonication time of 8-10 min, SNPs were successfully prepared. The as-prepared SNPs showed good uniformity and an almost perfect spherical shape, with diameters of 150-200 nm. The PO-loaded SNPs also exhibited regular shapes, with sizes of approximately 200 nm. The loading capacity, encapsulation efficiency, and yield of PO-loaded SNPs were ∼25.5%, ∼87.7%, and ∼93.2%, respectively. After encapsulation, PO possessed enhanced stability against thermal treatment (80 °C). The pseudo-first-order kinetics model accurately described the slow-release properties of PO from SNPs. This new approach of fabricating SNPs is rapid, high yield, and nontoxic, showing great potential in the encapsulation and sustained release of labile essential oils or other lipids.",

      "abstract": "A two-part experiment was performed to determine whether dietary peppermint oil could improve the growth and/or decrease aggression among blue swimmer crab, Portunus pelagicus early juveniles. A total of five isonitrogenous diets were made that contained increasing peppermint oil levels of 0.00, 0.05, 0.10, 0.50 or 1.00%.? These diets were fed to 45 replicate crabs in each treatment (total of 225 crabs) for 12 days, the final sizes and weights were measured, and then placed in 3 replicate containers (30 in total/treatment) to allow the opportunity for cannibalism over 10 days.? After 10 days, the remaining crabs were examined for any histopathological changes in gills or hepatopancreas.? Results showed dietary peppermint oil, at the tested levels, had no effect on the growth or cannibalism, in either experiments (p > 0.05).? However, there were substantial changes in the hepatopancreatic histopathology that included thinner tubules and significantly less B- and R-cells from 0.10% dietary peppermint oil and above.? The unaffected growth or cannibalism indicate that the levels of dietary peppermint oil used were insufficient and further investigations are required, particularly on the implications to the hepatopancreatic changes. ?",
