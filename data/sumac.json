      "abstract": "This study evaluated the effect of single, double, and triple combined doses of sumac, thyme, and cumin extracts on apoptosis and paraptosis in the HepG2 cell line. The effect of thyme and cumin extracts was higher in proteins (mTOR, caspase-8, caspase-9, Bax and bcl-2) other than caspase-3 protein. The expression of caspase-3 protein was higher in the sumac extract-treated groups. The expression levels of GRP78/Bip and DDIT3/Chop proteins, which are indicators of paraptosis, did not exert a significant difference between the extracts. Even though their protein expression is different, according to MTT results, sumac and thyme extracts showed an additive effect, thyme and cumin extracts showed an antagonistic effect, sumac and cumin extracts showed a synergistic effect, and sumac, thyme, and cumin extracts showed a synergistic effect. Sumac, thyme, and cumin extracts induced cell death by causing apoptosis in HepG2 cells, and they may have a supportive impact on the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: X-ray exposure can result in acute or chronic damage to lung tissue, leading to pneumonitis and fibrosis. Given the potent antioxidant properties of sumac, this study investigates the impact of hydroalcoholic sumac extract on X-ray-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats. METHODS: In this experimental study, 36 rats were randomly divided into six groups of six rats each. The treatment and sham groups received intraperitoneal administration of the extract daily for one week before exposure to X-ray radiation. On the seventh day, all rats except those in group 3 were exposed to 2 Gy of 6 MV X-rays using an electro-linear accelerator. Lung tissue was subsequently removed to assess the subacute effects of the extract. Data analysis involved independent sample t-tests and one-way ANOVA using SPSS 26. RESULTS: A single dose of X-rays significantly increased oxidative stress and lung tissue damage in rats. However, rats receiving vitamin C and hydroalcoholic sumac extract at two different doses (100 and 400 mg/kg intraperitoneally) positively improved lung damage and decreased antioxidant parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate that hydroalcoholic sumac extract can mitigate oxidative stress and enhance lung repair following X-ray radiation exposure."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Postpartum hemorrhage is a leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Emerging evidence suggests that the sumac plant possesses astringent and anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce menstrual bleeding. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of sumac capsules on postpartum bleeding among women at risk of excessive bleeding. METHODS: This randomized, triple-blind clinical trial was conducted in 2022-2023. Participants were 72 women who were referred for vaginal delivery to the 9th Day Hospital in Torbat Heydariyeh city, Iran. Participants were randomly divided into two groups immediately after delivery, the placebo group received routine care. The intervention group, in addition to routine care, received two oral capsules of 500 mg sumac immediately after the expulsion of the placenta and fetal membranes, as well as two hours later. The amount of bleeding was measured using plastic bags for blood collection, which were weighed along with the sheets and pads used at hours 1, 2, 3, and 4 postpartum. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 27, and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. 65 women completed the study. RESULTS: The sumac group exhibited lower mean bleeding volumes than the placebo group at all measured time points (first, second, third, and fourth hours after delivery). The independent t-test analysis revealed significant differences between the two groups' bleeding volume at the end of the first hour (p = 0.013), second hour (p < 0.001), third hour (p < 0.001), and fourth hour (p < 0.001); that was less in sumac group. Overall, the sumac group demonstrated a significantly lower mean total bleeding volume in the first four hours after delivery (215.78 ± 16.92 cc) compared to the placebo group (261.51 ± 17.258 cc) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Sumac capsules can be considered as a potentially effective and safe intervention for reducing postpartum bleeding among women at risk."

      "abstract": "In this study, sumac extract was utilized as an active ingredient and combined with grass pea protein isolate and polyvinyl alcohol to produce novel active nanofiber mats using an electrospinning technique. First, nanofiber mats were fabricated by different ratios (100:0, 90:10, 70:30, 50:50, 30:70, 10:90, 0:100) of grass pea protein isolate and polyvinyl alcohol. The characterization of nanofiber mats revealed that the nanofibers with a polymer ratio of 50:50 had appropriate mechanical properties and presented a fibrous and uniform morphology. Therefore, the 50:50 polymer solution ratio was selected to produce active nanofibers by adding different amounts (0%, 2%, and 4% (w/v)) of sumac extract. The average diameters of nanofibers decreased from 150 ± 31 to 122 ± 25, and 105 ± 19 nm, by increasing the concentration of sumac extract. Based on the SEM results, the electrospun nanofibers exhibited a bead-free and smooth surface. The FTIR and XRD analyses indicated the presence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the components. The antioxidant activity of the nanofibers was confirmed by DPPH analysis and ranged between 3.33% and 68.75%. Additionally, the antimicrobial test results indicated that the nanofibers with the highest sumac concentration (4%) displayed inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus, resulting in an inhibition zone of 10 mm. The optimal treatment of this study was grass pea protein isolate: polyvinyl alcohol ratio of 50:50 containing 4% sumac extract which can be used as a natural antimicrobial and antioxidant agent."

      "abstract": "Methotrexate (MTX) is commonly employed in cancer treatment, but its clinical use is restricted due to the MTX-associated renal injury. This study investigates the combined potential of Rhus coriaria (sumac) and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) against MTX-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. The high-resolution-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HR-LC-MS) of sumac extract tentatively identified 22 phytochemicals, mostly flavonoids, anthocyanins, and steroids. Preparation of sumac liposomes attained a suitable particle size of 3041.33 ± 339.42 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.208 ± 0.086, and an encapsulation efficiency of 84.92 ± 3.47%. Rat BMMSCs were injected into the tail vein of the experimental rats (0.5 × 106 cells, intravenous [iv]) of seven treated groups. The experimental design relies on either pre- or posttreatment of rats with intraperitoneal (IP) sumac liposomes (SL) (200 mg/kg, daily with a dose of MTX (300 µg/kg/14 days). The histopathological examination and serum analysis of creatinine and urea revealed good results, besides regulating levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. Additionally, a significant decrease in the gene expression levels of B-Cell Lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and caspases-3 and -9, a remarkable increase in the Bcl-2 Associated X-Protein (Bax), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme-oxygenase 1 expression, and a downregulation of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Collectively, the coadministration of SL with BMMSCs might be a potent therapeutic strategy for attenuation of MTX-induced renal damage. The network pharmacology analysis identified the involved key hub genes as KEAP1, Nrf2, HMOX1, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK1), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-KB), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1B), and caspase-3. The docking results revealed strong binding affinities of 7-O-methyl-cyanidin-3-O-(2″-galloyl)-galactoside with Keap1 and amentoflavone with MAPK. These insights pave the way for future experimental validation and therapeutic development of sumac-based phytoconstituents against MTX-induced nephrotoxicity.",

Sumac extract has been obtained through the soaking method, and its antioxidant properties were gauged using the DPPH free radical scavenging method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of sumac extract was determined on S. aureus obtained from hospitalized patients, as well as an assessment of biofilm-formation and the release of bacterial intracellular compounds. in vivo experimentation involved injecting bacteria (108 cfu/ml) into mice, which subsequently manifested indicators of symptoms of infection, and the number of bacteria within their bloodstream was quantified. The Sumac extract demonstrated strong antioxidant properties at concentrations of 1000 mg/ml. Furthermore, the agar tests for the gram staining, mannitol, coagulase, and DNase revealed that 190 cultured bacteria samples were identified as Staphylococcus aureus. These bacteria were resistant to clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, and methicillin antibiotics, but sensitive to erythromycin and penicillin antibiotics. Additionally, the bacteria displayed significant methicillin resistance and formed a strong biofilm (65.78%). The sumac extract showed a MIC range of 125-1000 µg/ml against Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment with concentrations above the MIC was found to prevent the formation of biofilm and increase the release of bacterial intracellular compounds. Sumac extract led to a decrease in bacterial count in the blood of mice and reduced signs of infection. Sumac extract demonstrated powerful antioxidant and antibacterial effects against resistant microorganisms, suggesting its potential as a promising compound for the treatment of resistant infections in future research."

      "abstract": "Clinical evidence suggests the beneficial effects of sumac on cardiovascular risk factors. However, these results are controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed to determine the effect of sumac supplementation on cardiovascular risk factors in adults. The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to 30 December 2023 to identify RCTs that were published in English. Data were presented as weighted mean difference (WMD) and associated 95 % confidence interval (CI). The quality of the included trials was measured using the Cochrane Collaboration's modified risk of bias tool. A pooled analysis of 16 trials showed that sumac consumption led to a significant reduction in fasting blood glucose (WMD: -6.03 mg/dl; 95 % CI: -9.67 to -2.39), hemoglobin A1c (WMD: -0.45 %; 95 % CI: -0.59 to -0.31), triglycerides (WMD: -9.07 mg/dL; 95 % CI: -16.19 to -1.94), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (WMD: -5.58 mg/dL; 95 % CI: -11.27 to -0.12), BMI (WMD: -0.22 kg/m2; 95 % CI: -0.38 to -0.05), weight (WMD: -0.85 kg; 95 % CI: -1.44 to -0.27), waist circumference (WMD: -0.54 cm; 95 % CI: -0.92 to -0.15), and diastolic blood pressure (WMD: -2.72 mmHg; 95 % CI: -4.16 to -1.29). High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level also increased significantly (WMD: 3.69 mg/dL; 95 % CI: 1.81-5.57). The overall results support possible protective and therapeutic effects of sumac on cardiovascular risk factors in adults.

Anthropometric indices, lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, insulin, Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance, aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, high sensitivity C-reactive protein and malondialdehyde were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. RESULTS: The results revealed a significant decrease in anthropometric indices (weight (p=0.001), body mass index (p=0.001), waist circumference (p=0.001), body fat mass (p=0.001), body fat percentage (p=0.001), visceral fat score (p=0.001), biochemical levels of total cholesterol (p=0.007), fasting blood sugar (p=0.006), insulin (p=0.004) and HOMA-IR (p=0.002)) after the intervention compared to the baseline. However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups concerning anthropometric and biochemical indices. CONCLUSION: In this study, no significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding anthropometric and biochemical indices.

The crude methanolic extracts derived from sumac fruit, pomegranate peel and Indian almond leaves were separated into anthocyanin and non-anthocyanin fractions using solid phase cartridges. The inhibitory effect of these fractions was determined on the growth of urease producing species and jack bean urease activity. Known compounds in the fractions were also docked with ureases of different biological origins viz. K. pneumoniae (PDB ID: 8HCN), K. aerogenes (PDB ID: 2KAU), Helicobacter pylori (PDB ID:8HC1)and Canavalia ensiformis (jack bean) (PDB ID: 3LA4) to determine their binding affinities and interaction with the enzyme. All the fractions showed significant inhibition growth for P. mirabilis, S. epidermidis and K.pneumoniae. Among the samples, sumac showed greatest inhibition against all (MIC 6-25 mg.mL-1) while among the fractions, anthocyanin was found to be most active (MIC 6-12 mg/mL). Likewise, all fractions inhibited urease with lowest ICs50 shown by sumac fractions (21-116 μg.mL-1). Out of 39 compounds docked, 27 showed interaction with movable flaps and/or active site of ureases which explains their mode of inhibition.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rhus coriaria L., commonly known as Sumac, is a plant from the Anacardiaceae family that is known for its high phytochemical content. These phytochemicals have the potential to effectively manage inflammation and oxidative stress. To explore the existing evidence on the impact of Sumac consumption on inflammation and oxidative stress, we conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to August 2023 to identify relevant studies examining the effects of Sumac on biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress. The selected studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane tool. RESULTS: A total of seven trials were included in this review. Among these trials, three focused on diabetes patients, while the remaining four involved individuals with fatty liver, overweight individuals with depression, and those with polycystic ovary or metabolic syndrome. Five studies reported the effects of Sumac on oxidative stress, with four of them demonstrating a significant reduction in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and an increase in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and paraoxonase 1 (PON1). Regarding inflammation, one study reported no significant difference in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels between the intervention and control groups. The results for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, reported in five trials, were inconsistent. CONCLUSION: Sumac consumption over time may positively affect oxidative stress, although short-term use shows minimal impact. While one study found no significant effect on IL-6 and TNF-α, hs-CRP levels could decrease or remain unchanged. Further meta-analyses are needed to fully understand Sumac's potential benefits in managing metabolic diseases.",

Meta-analysis to calculated the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95 %CI, Sub-group meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis were conducted throughout the study. RESULTS: 16 randomized controlled trials comprising a total number of 1,225 participants were included. The results of meta-analysis revealed that Sumac significantly affected low-density lipoprotein (WMD: -8.66 mg/dL; 95% CI: -14.2, -3.12), high-density lipoprotein (WMD: 3.15 mg/dL; 1.99,4.31), triglycerides (WMD: -11.96 mg/dL; -19.44, -4.48), fasting blood glucose (WMD: -4.15 mg/dL; -7.31, -0.98), insulin (WMD: -1.72; -3.18, -0.25), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; WMD: -0.61; -1.22, -0.01), and anthropometric indices (p < 0.05). Moreover, the results significantly reduced total cholesterol when the intervention duration was ≥12 weeks (WMD: -8.58 mg/dL; -16.8, -0.37). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that Sumac is potentially an effective complementary intervention to improve cardiometabolic parameters. Thus, patients could utilize Sumac as part of their diet to improve their overall cardiometabolic status."

      "abstract": "Hyperuricemia (HUA) is a prevalent chronic disease, characterized by excessive blood uric acid levels, that poses a significant health risk. In this study, the preventive effects and potential mechanisms of ethanol extracts from Chinese sumac (Rhus chinensis Mill.) fruits on HUA and uric acid nephropathy were comprehensively investigated. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in uric acid levels in hyperuricemia mice after treatment with Chinese sumac fruit extract, especially in the high-dose group, where the blood uric acid level decreased by 39.56%. Visual diagrams of the kidneys and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections showed the extract's effectiveness in protecting against kidney damage caused by excessive uric acid. Further investigation into its mechanism revealed that the extract prevents and treats hyperuricemia by decreasing uric acid production, enhancing uric acid excretion, and mitigating the oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions induced by excessive uric acid in the kidneys. Specifically, the extract markedly decreased xanthine oxidase (XOD) levels and expression in the liver, elevated the expression of uric acid transporters ABCG2, and lowered the expression of uric acid reabsorption proteins URAT1 and SLC2A9. Simultaneously, it significantly elevated the levels of endogenous antioxidant enzymes (SOD and GSH) while reducing the level of malondialdehyde (MDA). Furthermore, the expression of uric-acid-related proteins NLRP3, ACS, and Caspase-3 and the levels of IL-1β and IL-6 were significantly reduced. The experimental results confirm that Chinese sumac fruit extract can improve HUA and uric acid nephropathy in mice fed a high-purine yeast diet. This finding establishes a theoretical foundation for developing Chinese sumac fruit as a functional food or medicine for preventing and treating HUA.",

      "abstract": "This systematic review aimed to gather data on the effects of sumac supplementation on lipid profile. A systematic literature search was carried out using electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) up to March 2023 to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of sumac intake on lipid profile as an outcome. All participants enrolled in our study were adult individuals who consumed sumac, in various forms, as an intervention. The included articles were assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Heterogeneity tests of the selected trials were performed using the I2 statistic. Random effects models were assessed based on the heterogeneity tests, and pooled data were determined as the weighted mean difference with a 95% confidence interval. In total, seven RCTs with a total sample size of 570 subjects were included. This study found a significant decrease in total cholesterol (TC) (weighted mean difference [WMD]: -10.01 mg/dL; 95% CI: -18.67, -1.34), triglyceride (TG) (WMD: -8.52 mg/dL; 95% CI: -14.79, -2.25), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-C levels (WMD: -9.25 mg/dL; 95% CI: -14.56, -3.93); Moreover, a significant increase was observed in high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-C concentration (WMD: 2.97 mg/dL; 95% CI: 0.75, 5.19). The reduction in TG and TC was greater in studies with a duration of ≥12 compared to <12 weeks. The increase in HDL-C was greater in participants with an intervention duration of ≥12 compared to <12 weeks. Moreover, subgroup analysis based on the dose of sumac suggested a significant reduction in TC and LDL, specifically for doses below 3 g. Consumption of sumac significantly decreased serum TC, LDL-C, and TG concentrations. This study suggested significantly positive effects on HDL-C by intake of sumac. Longer interventions (>12 weeks) have a more favorable impact on TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C, while sumac doses below 3 g/day show greater effects on TC and LDL-C. These findings underscore the potential of sumac supplementation as a valuable approach to lipid profile management.",

PURPOSE: Therefore, the aim of this study includes evaluating the effect of different concentrations of SE on dentine micro-hardness comparing to grape seed extract (GSE). MATERIALS AND METHOD: In this experimental study, the GSE was purchased from available market and convert to 5% solution. Meanwhile the 5, 10, and 20% of SE solutions were prepared experimentally. The base line micro-hardness of 60 samples (30 premolars divided to buccal and lingual segments) was recorded triplicate for each specimen and they were randomly divided into 5 groups (four abovementioned experimental solutions and de-ionized water as negative control). For 35 consecutive days, each sample was twice pH cycled and treated by solutions. Ultimately, the final micro-hardness was recorded triplicate again for each sample and the numerical data was compared with each other using one-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD Post Hoc tests (α=0.05). RESULTS: The meanSD values of micro-hardness for the groups was recorded as 54.45 13.4, 65.6518.5, 39.572.26, 41.131.66 and 43.794.96 at base line and 10.40.99, 11.85 0.75, 10.161.84, 8.481.16 and 6.311.01 at final stage for control, GSE 5%, SE 5%, SE 10% and SE 20% respectively. There was no significant difference among the micro-hardness of the groups before treatment (p= 0.369). However, after experimental treatment, there was significant difference between the groups (p= 0.024) while in pairwise comparison just two groups (GSE 5% and SE 20%) had significant difference with each other (p= 0.017). CONCLUSION: The efficacy of SE was reversely related to its concentration. Moreover, neither GSE nor SE had significant effect on dentine micro-hardness after 35 day pH cycling."

Therefore, we aimed to assess the effect of sumac supplementation on MetS markers among adults with this syndrome. METHODS: In this triple-blinded randomized placebo-controlled cross-over clinical trial 47 adults with MetS were randomly assigned to receive 500 mg sumac or placebo (lactose) capsule, twice a day. Each phase took 6 weeks and there was a 2-week washout between phases. All clinical evaluations and laboratory tests were conducted before and after each phase. RESULTS: At the baseline of the study, mean (± SD) age, weight, and waist circumference of participants were respectively 58.7 (± 5.8) yr, 79.9 (± 14.3) kg, and 107.6 (± 10.8) cm. Intention to treat analysis (ITT) analyses revealed that sumac supplementation decreased systolic blood pressure by 5 mmHg (128.8 ± 21.4 at the baseline vs. 123.2 ± 17.6 after 6 weeks intervention, P = 0.001). The comparison of changes in two trial arms showed that sumac supplementation significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (sumac group -5.59 ± 10.6 vs. control group 0.76 ± 10.5, P = 0.004), but did not change anthropometric indices or diastolic blood pressure. Similar results were also found in the per-protocol analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This cross-over trial revealed that sumac supplementation could reduce systolic blood pressure in men and women with MetS. Daily intake of 1000 mg sumac, as an adjuvant therapy, may be beneficial in management of MetS in adults.",

Further analyses revealed that this bioactivity may be mainly achieved by modulating several inflammatory pathways, including NLRP3, NF-κB, and MAPK pathways. In addition, the extract can also improve oxidative stress by reducing the levels of malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase, increasing the contents of superoxide dismutase and glutathione.

The coronavirus mainly targets the human respiratory system, followed by cytokine storm, and altered immune responses associated with disease progression and adverse outcomes. Sumac and pomegranate juice are rich in bioactive compounds, which potentially have antiviral activities. This study is aimed at investigating the effect of a diet based on the use of sumac and pomegranate juice on the treatment of outpatients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, 182 outpatients with COVID-19 were randomly divided into two groups receiving a diet containing pomegranate juice and sumac along with standard treatment and the control group (group 2) receiving standard treatment. RESULTS: Consumption of a diet containing pomegranate juice and sumac in outpatients with COVID-19, who were receiving standard-of-care treatment, led to a significant decrease in fever, chills, cough, weakness, smell and taste disorders, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal pain compared with outpatients with COVID-19 who received only standard treatment. CONCLUSION: Clinical trials of outpatients have limitations such as patients' resilience to post-COVID-19 follow-up. However, the use of pomegranate juice and sumac can be efficacious in reducing COVID-19 symptoms. This trial is registered with IRCT20190406043175N3.",

So, we investigated the influence of sumac supplementation on insulin resistance, inflammation, oxidative stress, and antioxidant markers in adults with MetS. The current study was a single-center, triple-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial that was conducted on 47 patients with MetS. Participants were randomly divided into two groups of intervention and control in the first phase. They received capsules containing 500 mg sumac or placebo (lactose) twice a day, after lunch and dinner, for 6 weeks. After a 2-week washout period, the subjects crossed over to the alternate arm. In both arms, fasting venous blood samples were obtained at baseline and at the sixth week of the intervention to determine glycemic status, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and antioxidant enzymes activity. The mean (±SD) age, weight, and body mass index of participants were respectively 58.7 ± 5.83 years, 79.9 ± 14.35 kg, and 31.6 ± 4.6 kg/m2 ; 80.9% of subjects were females (n = 38). Based on per-protocol analyses, the serum fasting insulin concentration was unexpectedly decreased in the placebo group (change in sumac vs. control: 0.95 ± 3.9 vs. -1.17 ± 3.9 mU/L; p = 0.04). Sumac supplementation, compared to control, has marginally enhanced catalase activity (change in sumac vs. control: 2.91 ± 9.5 vs. -1.07 ± 9.1 nmol/min/ml; p = 0.06). This supplementation has also increased serum TAC and the activity of superoxide dismutase, but these changes were not significant. This intervention did not affect other insulin resistance, inflammatory, or oxidative stress markers. We found that 1 g/day sumac consumption for 6 weeks, as adjuvant therapy, could improve the antioxidant defense system in adults with MetS but did not affect insulin resistance, inflammation, or oxidative stress.",

Nanoparticles were used in cancer treatment because of their intrinsic anticancer properties. The use of plant extracts in the preparation of metallic nanoparticles as a convenient substitute has been proposed. This study assessed the cytotoxic, antioxidant and apoptotic effects of copper nanoparticles shelled with either turmeric or sumac biosynthesized as core-shell nanostructures on the liver tumour cell line (Huh-7). &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; The nanostructures were synthesized by sonochemical method and characterization was done to confirm the successful synthesis within the nanoscale. Cytotoxicity of nanostructures was investigated on Huh-7 and normal kidney epithelial cell lines (VERO). Malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase were estimated in cell lysate to assess the antioxidant properties of nanostructures. Caspase-3 was also measured as an apoptotic marker. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Both nanostructures had low IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; on Huh-7 cells and a non-toxic effect on VERO cells. The cytotoxic effect was coupled with a significant increase in antioxidant activities and apoptotic efficiency compared to control. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; The findings summarized here support the utilization of biosynthesized copper with turmeric or sumac as core-shell nanostructures as a novel chemotherapeutic drug for cancer treatment that improves antioxidant effect that modulates the side effect of cytotoxicity. Also, it is obvious that copper nanostructure biosynthesized with turmeric has a more advanced effect than that of sumac.",

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of sumac fruit on serum lipids and body mass index (BMI) of hemodialysis (HD) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This triple-blind randomized clinical trial study was conducted for 12 weeks on HD patients. Participants were randomly divided into three groups of 2-gram sumac (N = 40), 3-gram sumac (N = 40), and placebo (N = 40) by nonprobability consecutive sampling and stratified block randomization method based on inclusion criteria. Serum lipids and BMI were measured at the beginning of the study and also at the end of the sixth and the twelfth weeks. The physical activity and 24-hour dietary recall questionnaires were used to collect data. RESULTS: No significant difference was found between the level of nutrient and micronutrient intake (P > 0.05), physical activity (P=0.159), and BMI (P=0.718) of patients in the three groups before and after the intervention. However, the difference in serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in each studied group was significant over time (P < 0.001). The difference was not statistically significant between the groups before the intervention, 6 and 12 weeks after the intervention (group effect), and between the study groups over time (time-group interaction). No statistically significant difference was observed between the mean levels of TG (P=0.875), CHOL level (P=0.969), LDL level (P=0.998), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level (P=0.136), and BMI (P=0.608) in the groups over time. CONCLUSION: Consumption of sumac fruit significantly changed the LDL level over time. Although BMI and serum lipids changed in HD patients, these changes were not significant. Future studies are needed to determine the effective dose of sumac and any dose increase should take toxicity into account and consider a larger sample size and longer intervention and follow-up times."

      "abstract": "Herbal extracts containing natural bioactive substances with numerous beneficial effects have been recently noticed as appropriate alternatives for synthetic food preservatives. In this study, we aimed to optimize the effects of different sumac (Rhus coriaria) fruit extracts (SFE) on oxidative stability of soybean oil under accelerated conditions compared to a synthetic antioxidant. Hydro-ethanolic extracts (70%) of sumac fruits were prepared by three methods of immersion (I-SFE), ultrasound (U-SFE), and microwave (M-SFE). According to the response surface methodology (RSM), 13 runs were considered in the concentrations of 0, 500, and 1000 ppm of each extract that were added to the soybean oil and stored at 60°C for a 20-day period. All of the treatments were significantly (p < .05) efficient in preventing the chemical and sensory changes of soybean oil compared to the control in the dose-dependent manner during storage period. I-SFE treatment showed the lowest peroxide value (PV) (0.000063 meq (milliequivalents) O2/kg oil), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) (115.06 MDA (malondialdehyde)/kg oil), and acid value (0.0169 mg KOH (potassium hydroxide)/kg oil) among the other extracts at the end of the storage period. Furthermore, I-SFE treatment earned the highest sensory scores (flavor, color, odor, and overall acceptability) of soybean oil in the range of 4-5 in comparison to the other treatments and synthetic antioxidant during storage time. According to the analysis of RSM, I-SFE in the concentration of 999.998 ppm could optimally enhance the shelf life of soybean oil for 11.3614 days under accelerated conditions. It was concluded that I-SFE with the same efficiency as synthetic antioxidants can be considered as a suitable alternative in soybean oil with various health benefits."

Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is one of the major zoonotic diseases of human with a worldwide distribution. Long term albendazole therapy is usually associated with side effects including impaired liver function and leukopenia. The present study investigated the efficacy of the methanolic extract of Sumac, Rhus coriaria, on the secondary hydatid cyst development in mice and evaluated sumac effects on the expression of a profile of genes with a potential role in parasite development. Thirty-six mice were intraperitoneally inoculated with of with 3000 protoscoleces and six months after induction of infection were divided into three groups that received either oral sumac extract, albendazole or distilled water. The mice were necropsied 45 days later and the volume and weight of cysts were measured. The expression level of five target genes were analyzed using RT-qPCR. The volume and weight of the cysts were significantly lower in the sumac group compared to the controls. Decreased expressions were found in four out of the five genes following sumac administration. While significantly lower expressions in the sumac group were found for the cdk6, b-raf, fgfr and ras genes, no significant difference was found in cdk2 expression as compared with the control groups. Findings of the present study indicate high efficacy of sumac on the size and volume of secondary hydatid cysts in a murine CE model. Further studies are required to explore the most active and effective ingredients of this natural product.",

This effect was accompanied by stabilization of the protein structure, as was shown using ATR-FT-IR spectroscopy and fluorescence methods. C55H40O34 exhibited also a neuroprotective effect in high glucose-exposed Neuro2A cells suppressing ROS formation and expression of phospho NF-κβ and iNOS. At the same time C55H40O34 increased expression of heme oxygenase-1 and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase and mitochondrial complex I and V activities. Results from this study demonstrates a potent antiglycation activity of C55H40O34 in vitro and indicates its possible therapeutic application in glycation related diseases.",

Due to the rapid rise in deaths resulted from this infection all around the world, the identification of drugs against this new coronavirus is an important requirement. Among the drugs that can fight this type of infection; natural products are substances that serve as sources of beneficial chemical molecules for the development of effective therapies. In this study, Camphor, Artemisinin and 14 Sumac phytochemicals were docked in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB code: 6LU7). We have also performed molecular dynamic simulation at 100 ns with MM-GBSA/PBSA analysis for the structures with the best affinity in the binding site of the studied enzyme (Hinokiflavone and Myricetin) after docking calculations to consider parameters like RMSD, covariance, PCA, radius of gyration, potential energy, temperature and pressure. The result indicates that Hinokiflavone and Myricetin are the structures with best affinity and stability in the binding site of the studied enzyme and they respect the conditions mentioned in Lipinski's rule and have acceptable ADMET proprieties; so, these compounds have important pharmacokinetic properties and bioavailability, and they could have more potent antiviral treatment of COVID-19 than the other studied compounds.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is the one of the main causes of mortality worldwide. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have revealed the beneficial effects of sumac (Rhus coriaria) on cardiometabolic risk factors. However, the entirety of the evidence has yet to be summarized in a systematic review. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of sumac on several cardiometabolic risk factors in patients with MetS and related disorders. METHODS: We reviewed Medline, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL for RCTs published from inception to December 2020 evaluating the impact of sumac in adults with MetS or related disorders. Outcome measures included anthropometric measures, glycemic indices, blood lipids, blood pressure and liver enzymes. Pooled effect sizes were reported as standard mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Trials were pooled using a random effects model. RESULTS: Nine studies enrolling 526 participants met the inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis. Our results indicate that sumac intake significantly decrease fasting blood sugar (FBS) (SMD: -0.28; 95% CI: -0.54, -0.02; I2 = 00.0%), insulin (SMD: -0.67; 95% CI: -0.99, -0.36; I2 = 03.7%), and insulin resistance (measured through the Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)) (SMD: -0.79; 95% CI: -1.24, -0.34; I2 = 50.1%). Sumac intake did not have a significant impact on weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist to hip ratio (WHR), HbA1c, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high density lipoproteins (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT). CONCLUSION: Sumac, as an adjuvant therapy, may decrease serum levels of FBS, insulin and HOMA-IR. However, due to high heterogeneity in the included studies, these findings must be interpreted with great caution. Larger, well-designed placebo-controlled clinical trials are still needed to further evaluate the capacity of sumac as a complementary treatment to control MetS risk factors.",

The sumac seed power (SSP), produced by grinding dried fruits, is recognized to have defensive and beneficial effects on numerous health‑related problems. In this study, SSP was included in broilers basal‑diet to investigate the comparative effects of different levels of SSP on performance, carcass characteristics, blood parameters, immune system and ileal microorganisms. A total of 225, one day‑old male broilers (Ross 308) were randomly assigned to the five dietary treatments with three replicates per treatment. The experimental diets were: basal‑diet (BD); and BD including 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20% SSP, respectively. During the whole feeding period (42 days), birds fed corn‑based grower (1‑21 days) and finisher (22‑42 days) diets, respectively. Results indicated that supplementing SSP had no effect on broiler body weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion as well as carcass characteristics (P > 0.05). Similarly, blood total protein, albumin, glucose and triglyceride were not influenced by dietary SSP. Conversely, serum total cholesterol and LDL‑cholesterol levels were decreased, while HDL‑cholesterol increased in all SSP fed groups compared to control (P < 0.05). In this study the addition of SSP in broilers diets did not show any effect on blood heterophils and lymphocyte. Moreover, the lactobacillus count remained unaffected by dietary treatments, while E. coli count in broiler ileal content was lower when fed 0.10% SSP than the other groups (P < 0.05). Thus, the present findings indicated a positive effect of feeding SSP (especially at 0.10% diet) on blood cholesterol levels and E. coli count in broiler chickens",

Owing to its bountiful beneficial values, sumac has been used in traditional medicine for the management and treatment of many ailments including hemorrhoids, wound healing, diarrhea, ulcer, and eye inflammation. This plant is rich in various classes of phytochemicals including flavonoids, tannins, polyphenolic compounds, organic acids, and many others. By virtue of its bioactive, Rhus coriaria possesses powerful antioxidant capacities that have ameliorative and therapeutic benefits for many common diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. This review describes the phytochemical properties of R. coriaria and then focuses on the potent antioxidant capacities of sumac. We then dissect the cellular and molecular mechanisms of sumac's action in modulating many pathophysiological instigators. We show how accumulating evidence supports the antibacterial, antinociceptive, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and anticancer effects of this plant, especially that toxicity studies show that sumac is very safe to consume by humans and has little toxicity. Taken together, the findings we summarize here support the utilization of this plant as an attractive target for drug discovery."

      "abstract": "Comprehensive scientific data provide evidence that isolated phytochemicals or whole plant foods may beneficially modify carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the oncostatic activities of Rhus coriaria L. (sumac) using animal models (rat and mouse), and cell lines of breast carcinoma. R. coriaria (as a powder) was administered through the diet at two concentrations (low dose: 0.1% (w/w) and high dose: 1 % (w/w)) for the duration of the experiment in a syngeneic 4T1 mouse and chemically-induced rat mammary carcinoma models. After autopsy, histopathological and molecular analyses of tumor samples in rodents were performed. Moreover, in vitro analyses using MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were conducted. The dominant metabolites present in tested R. coriaria methanolic extract were glycosides of gallic acid (possible gallotannins). In the mouse model, R. coriaria at a higher dose (1%) significantly decreased tumor volume by 27% when compared to controls. In addition, treated tumors showed significant dose-dependent decrease in mitotic activity index by 36.5% and 51% in comparison with the control group. In the chemoprevention study using rats, R. coriaria at a higher dose significantly reduced the tumor incidence by 20% and in lower dose non-significantly reduced tumor frequency by 29% when compared to controls. Evaluations of the mechanism of oncostatic action using valid clinical markers demonstrated several positive alterations in rat tumor cells after the treatment with R. coriaria. In this regard, histopathological analysis of treated tumor specimens showed robust dose-dependent decrease in the ratio of high-/low-grade carcinomas by 66% and 73% compared to controls. In treated rat carcinomas, we found significant caspase-3, Bax, and Bax/Bcl-2 expression increases; on the other side, a significant down-regulation of Bcl-2, Ki67, CD24, ALDH1, and EpCam expressions and MDA levels. When compared to control specimens, evaluation of epigenetic alterations in rat tumor cells in vivo showed significant dose-dependent decrease in lysine methylation status of H3K4m3 and H3K9m3 and dose-dependent increase in lysine acetylation in H4K16ac levels (H4K20m3 was not changed) in treated groups. However, only in lower dose of sumac were significant decreases in the expression of oncogenic miR210 and increase of tumor-suppressive miR145 (miR21, miR22, and miR155 were not changed) observed. Finally, only in lower sumac dose, significant decreases in methylation status of three out of five gene promoters-ATM, PTEN, and TIMP3 (PITX2 and RASSF1 promoters were not changed). In vitro evaluations using methanolic extract of R. coriaria showed significant anticancer efficacy in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (using Resazurin, cell cycle, annexin V/PI, caspase-3/7, Bcl-2, PARP, and mitochondrial membrane potential analyses). In conclusion, sumac demonstrated significant oncostatic activities in rodent models of breast carcinoma that were validated by mechanistic studies in vivo and in vitro.",

Sumac (Rhus coriaria L.) is a popular herb which contains major bioactive compounds known for a variety of health benefits. This study aimed to assess the effects of sumac powder supplementation on hepatic fibrosis and some metabolic markers in patients with NAFLD. METHODS: Eighty-four patients diagnosed with NAFLD were included in this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. They were randomly assigned to receive 2000 mg per day sumac powder (n = 42) or placebo (n = 42) for 12 weeks. Also, both groups received a 500-calories deficit diet plan. Hepatic fibrosis and liver enzymes (ALT and AST) as well as fasting blood sugar (FBS), serum insulin, HbA1c, HOMA-IR (insulin resistance index), QUICKI (insulin sensitivity index), malondialdehyde (MDA), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured at baseline and the end of trial. RESULTS: Eighty patients completed the trial. After 12-weeks of intervention, subjects in the sumac group showed a greater decrease in hepatic fibrosis and liver enzymes as well as FBS, serum insulin, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, MDA, and hs-CRP, compared to the placebo (P-value < 0.05); while the QUICKI was significantly higher in the sumac group at the end of intervention. CONCLUSION: Daily intake of 2000 mg sumac powder along with a low-calorie diet for 12 weeks was beneficial for the management of NAFLD.",

We investigated the benefits of adding the medicinal plants sumac and thyme at 1, 2 or 3% of the diet for male Ross broiler chicks, with four replicates of ten birds in each treatment group and a Control. Feed intake was reduced for chickens fed the sumac supplements, and, at the two higher doses, defeathered body weight was also reduced. Abdominal fat was reduced by 41% in chickens fed thyme and 62% in those fed sumac. This reflected reduced low density lipoproteins in their blood, and in higher dose thyme treatments and all sumac treatments, reduced high density lipoproteins in blood. Apart from this, there was little effect of the supplements on carcass composition. Blood glucose was reduced in the supplemented chickens. There was evidence of higher antibody titers to Newcastle disease and influenza in supplemented chickens. It is concluded that both thyme and sumac offer potential to reduce fat content and improve disease responsiveness in broiler production systems."

Rhus coriaria (RC: sumac) extracts may enhance cell viability by reinforcing defenses against free radical species in several progressive diseases as well as inflammatory diseases. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of RC in a rat NEC model in terms of intestinal damage. Newborn pups were separated into three groups: control, NEC, and NEC treated with RC. Mortality and clinical sickness scores were evaluated. At the end of the study, ileum and proximal colon were obtained from all rats and histopathological and immunohistochemical studies were performed. In this study, the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and anti-apoptotic activities of RC were demonstrated in a rat NEC model, which suggests RC as a promising treatment option for preventing intestinal tissue damage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Free oxygen radicals, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and inflammatory mediators play major roles in the development of NEC. Intestinal tissue damage is caused by necrosis and apoptosis as a result of intestinal inflammation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and anti-apoptotic activities of RC are especially due to its phenolic compounds. In this study, the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and anti-apoptotic activities of RC were demonstrated in a rat NEC model. RC can suggest as a new treatment option for preventing intestinal injury.",

The disease is caused by changes in the metabolism, the structure and function of multiple joints, and joint tissues. Sumac is one of the indigenous plants of Iran and has traditionally been used as a spice in Iran. The aim of this study was to investigate the reduction of expression of IL-18, IL-1β genes in the articular joint by sumac fruit extract (Rhus coriaria L.). METHODS: The alcoholic extract of sumac fruit (E.E.R.C.L) was prepared from the Genetic Reserve Center. Bleeding was used to provide synoviocyte cells from the joint and fluid of the anatomical metacarpal limb of the 8-month-old Holstein healthy calf without any signs of inflammation. Using cell-hemocytometer count, their viability was evaluated by trypan blue and after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) proliferation and injection to enhance the level of cytokines. After isolating the RNA and preparing the cDNA, RT-PCR and PCR were performed and then, using the real-time PCR method, the expression of the desired genes was investigated. RESULTS: In this study, after the expression of IL-18 cytokines, IL-1β increased to 100%, and following the treatment with alcoholic extract, the reduction of expression of these cytokines was 33.61% and 29.01%, respectively. The results of anti-inflammatory effects showed that the alcoholic extract of sumac reduced the IL-1β, IL-18 expression in LPS-stimulated cells. CONCLUSION: Sumac fruit extract can be an effective medication for reducing pain.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the prominent cause of mortality worldwide. Hypercholesterolemia is a chief risk factor for the progress of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) such as herbal interventions has received much attention in literature. Rhus Coriaria (RC) with the general name Sumac is a medicinal spice, especially in Middle Eastern countries which is well known as an anti-lipid spice. This study aimed to summarize the existing findings regarding the effect of RC on the lipid profile. In this review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of RC on blood lipids were included. Electronic searches using the MeSH terms were conducted in the following databases: Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library. The effect of RC on serum lipid concentration were measured as standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) by the random-effects model. The initial search extracted 119 potentially relevant articles. After studying these publications, 4 were potentially eligible and retrieved in full text (four RCTs). Based on the results of the systematic review, RC has positive effects on different indices of the lipid profile including increasing Apo A-I and HDL; decreasing Apo B, Apo B/ Apo A1 ratio, total cholesterol, LDL and triglyceride. However the meta-analysis conducted on three studies on total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglyceride individually did not show any significant difference between intervention and control groups. No definite conclusion could be made on the effect of RC on serum blood lipids due to lack of sufficient clinical trials and variable inconsistency. Future trials with desirable designs that would eliminate the limitations in the current evidence are needed before conclusive claims can be made about the effect of RC on the lipid profile.",

Silver NPs (AgNPs) synthesised by environmentally friendly method exhibit a high medical potential. This study was conducted to determine the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of AgNPs synthesised from sumac (Anacardiaceae family) fruit aqueous extract (AgSu/NPs) on human breast cancer cells (MCF-7). The anti-proliferative effect of AgSu/NPs was determined by MTT assay. The apoptotic properties of AgSu/NPs were assessed by morphological analysis and acridine orange/propidium iodide (AO/PI) and DAPI staining. The mechanism of apoptosis induction in treated cells was investigated using molecular analysis. Overall results of morphological examination and cytotoxic assay revealed that AgSu/NPs exert a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the viability of MCF-7 cells (IC50 of ∼10 µmol/48 h). AO/PI staining confirmed the occurrence of apoptosis in cells treated with AgSu/NPs. In addition, molecular analysis demonstrated that the apoptosis in MCF-7 cells exposed to AgSu/NPs was induced via up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2. These findings suggested the potential use of AgSu/NP as cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic efficacy and its possible application in modern medicine for treating certain disorders, such as cancer.",

Melissa, sumac, licorice, rosemary, and geranium have antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and local analgesic effect. Shortening recovery period of recurrent herpes labialis and control of viral protein formation are the other effects of these herbs. The aim of this study is design, formulation, and evaluation of the gel containing extracts of these five herbs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study after photochemical and macroscopic evaluation of these medicinal herbs, the semisolid concentrated extracts were incorporated in gel bases. Mucoadhesive gels were prepared using carbopol 940, sodium carboxymethylcellulose (Na CMC) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose K4M as bioadhesive polymers. Physicochemical tests, viscosity, mucoadhesive strength measurement, and in vitro drug release study were carried out on formulations F10 (carbopol 940, 0.5% and Na CMC, 3%) and F11 (carbopol 940, 1% and Na CMC, 3%). RESULTS: Polyphenol content of extracts mixture was measured 210.8 ± 13.68 mg GAE/g. pH of formulations was 6.0 ± 0.2. 14 gel formulations were prepared. Physical appearance, homogeneity, and consistency of F10 and F11 were good. Mucoadhesion and viscosity of F11 was more than F10. Study of release profiles in F10 and F11 formulations showed drug release from F11 was slower. CONCLUSION: The best formulation for treatment and shortening recovery period of recurrent labial herpes infections should exhibit high value of mucoadhesion, show controlled release of drug. F11 with the highest viscosity and mucoadhesion and the lowest release rate was considered as the best formulation."

Sumac (Rhus coriaria L.) is rich in biologically active ingredients known to improve cardiovascular health. We investigated the effect of sumac on systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, flow-mediated dilation (FMD), body mass index (BMI), and serum concentrations of lipids and fasting blood sugar (FBS) in participants with hyperlipidemia in a triple-blind randomized placebo- controlled crossover trial. METHODS: Thirty adults with dyslipidemia (mild to moderate elevation of plasma total cholesterol and/or triglycerides [TG; total cholesterol ≥ 6.0 mmol/L or TG ≥ 1.7 mmol/L and TG ≤ 5.0 mmol/L]) were assigned randomly to a sumac or a placebo group. Participants in the sumac group received sumac capsules (500 mg/twice daily) for the first 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks' washout period; the patients were then switched to a 4-week interval and received placebo for 4 weeks in the second period. The placebo group received these treatments in reverse order. FMD, BMI, SBP, DBP, lipids, and FBS were measured at baseline and after each period. RESULTS: Differences between placebo group and sumac group (placebo-sumac) were significantly decreased for BMI (0.21 ± 0.075 kg/m2), SBP (1.87 ± 0.83 mm Hg), DBP (1.32 ± 0.46 mm Hg), and total cholesterol (14.42 ± 4.95 mmol/L) and significantly increased for FMD (-0.23% ± 0.065%). Plasma level of TG did not change significantly across the treatment. CONCLUSION: Sumac consumption may decrease cardiovascular risk factors in persons with mild to moderate hyperlipidemia.",

A total of 63 (ATAK-S: Domestic Turkish Laying Hens) laying hens (average weight: 1470 g each hen, 25-weeks of age) were assigned to seven treatment diets including sumac seed (S) and ginger root powder (G) at 0 g/kg (control), 10 g/kg (S1), 20 g/kg (S2), and 30 g/kg (S3); 10 g/kg (G1), 20 g/kg (G2), or 30 g/kg in rations respectively, for 8 weeks. After a two-week adaptation period to cages, the hens were allocated to 7 groups with 9 replicates of 1 hen in per cage each. The replications were allotted equally into the upper and lower cages to minimize the effects of cage level. In this study, egg yolk cholesterol had a decrease (p <0.05) in supplemented diet( sumac seed and ginger root powder). Fatty acid content in yolk; saturated fatty acid, monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids and rate of n6/n3 were not significant (p <0.05). However, dietary supplementation with sumac and ginger powder reduced and yolk/blood cholesterol concentrations in laying hens. Supplementation of sumac and ginger affected on HDL, there was found a significant effect (p < 0.05) in treatment groups. Moreover, LDL positively decreased in all treatment groups compared with the control group. The findings of this study suggested that feeding sumac and ginger tend to be decreasing cholesterol levels in both yolk and blood on laying hens. It can be concluded that ginger root and sumac seed powder can be used as an effective feed additive to improve fatty acid composition and yolk and blood cholesterol in ATAK-S laying hens.",

Objective This study investigates the in vivo healing and protective effects of lyophilized extract sumac against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic complications. Materials and methods Toxicity test was conducted in three different dosages (250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg of plant extracts, respectively). Six groups of seven rats each were used in experiments. Groups were designed as Normal control, Diabetic (DM), DM + AC-20 mg/kg, DM + Extract-100 mg/kg, DM + Extract 250 mg/kg and DM + Extract 500 mg/kg group. Experimental diabetes [50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.)] was induced by STZ. The effects of oral administration of the extract for 21 d on the level of serum glucose, insulin, C-peptide, lipid profile (LP), hepatic and renal damage biomarkers (HRDB), diabetic serum biomarkers (DSB), glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), antioxidant defence system constituents (ADSCs), malondialdehyde (MDA) and α-glucosidase activity in small intestine tissue were evaluated. Results The extract decreased the levels of blood glucose in diabetic groups (an average of 31%). Triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein levels were balanced by plant extract (500 mg/kg) supplementation in the diabetic group. Decreased levels of aspartate aminotransferase (89%), alanine aminotransferase (91%), lactate dehydrogenase (35%), alkaline phosphatase (47%), creatinine (25%) and urea (29%) were detected in plant extract (500 mg/kg) supplemented diabetic group. Additionally, a considerable increase in the HRDB, DSB, LP, MDA and fluctuated ADSC levels were restored in RC-extract supplemented groups. Conclusion RC lyophilized extract has a healing effect on diabetes and diabetes-related complications.",

Different extraction methods were applied and extracts were characterized through Ultra Fast High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to Photodiode array detector and Electrospray ionization Mass spectrometer (UPLC-PDA-ESI/MSn) for their phenol and anthocyanin contents. The concentrated pomegranate peel extract (PGE-C) was the richest in phenols (66.97 g gallic acid equivalents/kg) while the concentrated sumac extract from fruits (SUF-C) showed the highest anthocyanin amount (171.96 mg cyanidin 3-glucoside equivalents/kg). Both phenolic and anthocyanin profile of pomegranate and sumac extracts were quite different: pomegranate extract was rich in cyanidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-glucoside and ellagic acid derivatives, while sumac extract was characterized by 7-methyl-cyanidin 3-galactoside and gallic acid derivatives. The concentrated extracts from both pomegranate peel and sumac leaves significantly reduced the development of Botrytis rots. In particular, the extract from pomegranate peel completely inhibited the pathogen at different intervals of time (0, 12, and 24 h) between treatment and pathogen inoculation on fruits maintained at 22-24 °C and high relative humidity (RH). This extract may represent a valuable alternative to control postharvest fungal rots in view of its high efficacy because of the low cost of pomegranate peel, which is a waste product of processing factories.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, 56 male Naval Medical Research Institute mice were randomly divided into seven groups (n=8): control; diabetic mice; diabetic mice administered glibenclamide (0.25 mg/kg); diabetic mice who received the hydro-alcoholic extract of R. coriaria seeds (200 and 400 mg/kg groups); and normal mice who received this extract (200 and 400 mg/kg groups). Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg) 15 minutes after an injection of nicotinamide (120 mg/kg). Then, glibenclamide and the above mentioned extract were administered orally for 28 consecutive days. Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, serum samples, the testes, and the cauda epididymis were removed immediately for hormonal, testis morphology, and sperm parameter assessments. RESULTS: Body and testicular weight, sperm count and viability, and serum luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone levels were significantly lower in the diabetic mice (p<0.05). The diabetic mice treated with 400 mg/kg of the hydro-alcoholic extract of R. coriaria seeds recovered from these reductions (p<0.05). Further, glibenclamide alleviated hormonal and sperm count depletion in diabetes-induced mice (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The present results indicated that the hydro-alcoholic extract of R. coriaria seeds has anti-infertility effects in diabetic males."

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of sumac (R. coriaria L.) powder on insulin resistance (IR), malondialdehyde (MDA), high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity in type 2 diabetic patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A double-blind randomized placebo controlled trial on 41 type 2 diabetic volunteers was conducted. Participants randomly assigned into 3 g per day sumac powder (n = 22) or placebo (n = 19) groups for 3 months. IR was assessed using the homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), which including measurement of insulin by immunoassay method and measurement of glucose by enzymatic method. MDA and PON1 activity were measured colorimetrically, hs-CRP turbidimetrically. RESULTS: There were a significant increase in PON1 activity (from 84.72 ± 30.59 to 92.91 ± 32.63) and significant decrease in insulin (from 7.09 ± 4.28 to 5.32 ± 3.22), HOMA-IR (from 2.56 ± 1.58 to 1.67 ± 0.94), MDA (from 2.71 ± 0.73 to 1.97 ± 0.49), and also hs-CRP (from 18.49 ± 16.96 to 15.89 ± 16.70) in the sumac group at the end of study compared with initial values (P < 0.05). Furthermore, there were significant differences in MDA and PON1 between the two groups at the end of the study (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the mean of differences of insulin, HOMA-IR, MDA, hs-CRP and PON1 activity between groups were significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We concluded that daily intake of 3 g sumac for 3 months may be beneficial for diabetic patients to make them less susceptible to cardiovascular disease."

      "abstract": "Previous works on staghorn sumac (Rhus hirta) were mostly dedicated to its phytochemical profiles, antioxidant properties, and antidiabetic potentials. This study explored the potential of staghorn-sumac-derived functional ingredients for food and pharmacological applications. Sumac may have other biological functions, such as inhibitory effect on cancerous cells independent of its antioxidant properties. We characterized sumac and raspberry interactions, and their antioxidant capacities (ACs) and their inhibitory effect on both normal and cancerous cells. Mixing sumac and raspberry extracts yielded significantly higher ACs than the sum of sumac and raspberry as evaluated by three in vitro AC assays. However, the potential use of staghorn sumac as a natural source of dietary antioxidant supplement for oxidative-stress-related disorders might be challenged by its cytotoxicity in culturing normal cells. Remarkably, mixing sumac and raspberry showed maximal inhibition of the growth of both rat colon and human breast cancer cells with relatively low cytotoxicity toward normal rat colon and human breast epithelial cells, as compared with sumac or raspberry treatment alone. Sumac-derived products and their synergistic interactions with other food ingredients have great promise as functional food or nutraceutical products that would target cancer cells with minimal toxic effects to normal cells.",

It is a tannin-rich herb that is widely used in traditional Korean medicine. Its various pharmacological effects, including its radical-scavenging effects, have been reported. The purpose of the current study was to determine if these radical-scavenging effects can be confirmed using in vitro assays and to investigate its neuroprotective effects, optimal dosage, mechanisms, and therapeutic time window in an animal model of stroke. Galla Rhois 85% methanol extract (GRE) exhibited potent and dose-dependent radical-scavenging effects on various radicals. Oral administration of GRE (300 mg/kg) in a transient focal cerebral ischemia rat model (two hours of occlusion followed by 22 hours of reperfusion) reduced the brain infarct volume by 37.5%. It also improved sensory motor function and reduced lipid-peroxidation in middle cerebral artery occlusion. However, it did not have any inhibitory effects on brain edema. The time window study revealed that pre- and co-treatment with GRE had protective effects, but post-treatment with GRE (three or six hours after ischemia) did not have protective effects. In conclusion, GRE had potent radical-scavenging activities and neuroprotective effects in a rat model of stroke when it was pre- and co-administered. The optimal dosage may be around 300 mg/kg for oral administration.",

The inoculated tomatoes (2.71-4.35 log cfu/tomato) were subjected to treatment for 5, 10, 15 and 20 min by washing with sterile distilled water (control), sumac extracts or oregano oil suspensions with or without rinsing in sterile distilled water. Treatment of tomatoes with sumac and oregano caused significant reductions in S. Typhimurium population compared to the control (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference between washing times in the reduction of S. Typhimurium (P>0.05). The maximum logarithmic reductions of S. Typhimurium were obtained at levels of 2.38 and 2.78 logarithmic units on tomatoes treated with 4% sumac extract and 100 ppm oregano, respectively. No statistical difference was obtained in the number of S. Typhimurium recovered in different concentrations of treatment solutions in four different treatment times (P>0.05).

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration is integral in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Sumac (Rhus coriaria) berries are believed to have atheroprotective effects. Therefore, Sumac, which is a rich source of tannin antioxidants, was tested for its capacity to inhibit VSMC migratory activity. MATERIALS & METHODS: Tannin was extracted and purified from ground Sumac. Cultured rat carotid VSMCs were treated with different concentrations of tannin. After 10 days of tannin treatment, VSMC migratory activity in response to platelet-derived growth factor-BB was measured by transmembrane migration assay. An equal number of VSMCs was loaded on top of the inserts and at the bottom of the wells. After fixation and staining, cells migrating through the inserts and cells seeded at the bottom of the wells were counted. RESULTS: A significant reduction (62%) of VSMC migration was evident in tannin-treated cells. To rule out any possible toxicity and cell death, cells at the bottom of the wells were also counted. No difference between the tannin-treated group and the controls was observed in the number of cells seeded at the bottom of the wells. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that tannin extracted from Sumac possesses potent antimigratory activity. Sumac may have potential for the prevention or treatment of atherosclerosis and its clinical manifestations. Further experiments, especially in vivo, are required to examine the atheroprotective effect of Sumac."

In certain outdoor occupations, for example, agriculture and forestry, as well as among many outdoor enthusiasts, Toxicodendron dermatitis presents a significant hazard. This review considers the epidemiology, identification, immunochemistry, pathophysiology, clinical features, treatment, and prevention of this common dermatologic problem. Recent research in prevention is emphasized, and resources to help in the identification of plants are provided in the bibliography. The literature was searched using a MEDLINE query for \"Toxicodendron dermatitis\", and the identified article bibliographies were searched as well.",

      "abstract": "Allergic contact dermatitis from poison ivy, oak, or sumac is common among people who work or exercise outdoors. The plants, classified in the genus Rhus or Toxicodendron, contain allergens that can cause reactions ranging from mild pruritus to severe urticaria or generalized maculopapular eruptions. Initial management includes cleansing, cold compresses, and, possibly, oral antihistamines for symptomatic relief. Topical corticosteroids are given for localized nonfacial eruptions; systemic corticosteroids are used for severe eruptions. Prevention involves avoiding contact with the plants and washing exposed skin within 2 hours."
