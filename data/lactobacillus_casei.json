      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is increasing each year. For example, in 2019 it was directly responsible for an estimated >1 million deaths. Additionally, the development of new drugs is much slower, generating enormous concerns about responses to infection in the future health scenario. Therefore, probiotics have emerged as an alternative to antibiotics. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to isolate and identify a Lactobacillus casei from healthy canine skin and investigate its antimicrobial effect on isolates of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius originating from dogs with pyoderma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: L. casei was isolated from skin samples collected with a sterile cotton swab from the inner pinnae of healthy dogs. It was then cultured, identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and tested against 30 different clinical isolates and one American Type Culture Collection strain of S. pseudintermedius using the spot-on-the-lawn technique. Its safety was assessed through a modified Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion susceptibility test. RESULTS: L. casei inhibited the growth of all isolates of S. pseudintermedius. The mean value of the inhibition halo of all isolates was 11.3 mm. A significant positive correlation (Pearson's linear correlation = 0.444; p = 0.014) was noted between the inhibitory halos formed by L. casei on the S. pseudintermedius isolates and the halos produced by the tested antimicrobial discs on the same isolates. The L. casei strain demonstrated sensitivity to all tested antimicrobials. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The study indicates that using commensal bacteria from canine skin, specifically L. casei, to control bacterial infections caused by S. pseudintermedius can be a promising complementary or alternative therapy to antibiotics relevant to animal and human health."

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis, a significant bone disease predominantly affecting elderly and postmenopausal women, leads to increased bone fragility and fracture risk, presenting a major public health concern with substantial socioeconomic implications. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of Lactobacillus strains, known for their immunomodulatory properties, in an ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis mouse model. Among three tested strains Lactobacillus casei GKC1, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GKLC1, and Lactobacillus johnsonii GKJ2, GKC1 demonstrated superior efficacy in promoting osteogenesis-related gene expression, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2). In ovariectomized mice (n = 8/group), both live and heat-inactivated GKC1 (57 mg/kg) and fermented GKC1 (1000 mg/kg) were administered orally for 28 days, with alendronate (2.5 mg/kg) serving as a positive control. The treatment significantly improved bone mineral density and femoral microstructure parameters compared to the ovariectomized control group. For the first time, heat-inactivated GKC1 exhibited superior anti-inflammatory effects through reduction of IL-17A and enhanced bone microstructural integrity, suggesting its potential as a safe and effective therapeutic agent for postmenopausal osteoporosis management. These findings provide compelling evidence for the development of postbiotic-based interventions in osteoporosis treatment, offering a promising alternative to conventional therapeutics.",

      "abstract": "Bacterial implant-associated infections predominantly contribute to the failure of prosthesis implantation. The local biofilm microenvironment (BME), characterized by its hyperacidic condition and high hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) level, inhibits the host's immune response, thereby facilitating recurrent infections. Here, a Janus PEGylated CuS nanoparticle (CuPen) armed engineered Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) denoted as LC@CuPen, is proposed to interfere with bacterial metabolism and arouse macrophage antibiofilm function. Once LC@CuPen reached the BME, NIR irradiation-activated mild heat damages L. casei and biofilm structure. Meanwhile, the BME-responsive LC@CuPen can catalyze local H2O2 to produce toxic •OH, whereas in normal tissues, the effect of •OH production is greatly reduced due to the higher pH and lower H2O2 concentration. The released bacteriocin from damaged L. casei can destroy the bacterial membrane to enhance the penetration of •OH into damaged biofilm. Excessive •OH interferes with normal bacterial metabolism, resulting in reduced resistance of bacteria to heat stress. Finally, under the action of mild heat treatment, the bacterial biofilm lysed and died. Furthermore, the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in LC@CuPen can induce M1 polarization of macrophages through NF-κB pathway and promote the release of inflammatory factors. Inflammatory factors enhance the migration of macrophages to the site of infection and phagocytose bacteria, thereby inhibiting the recurrence of infection. Generally, this engineered L. casei program presents a novel perspective for the treatment of bacterial implant-associated infections and serves as a valuable reference for future clinical applications of engineered probiotics.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a widely distributed endocrine disorder in the world. Altered reproductive function is a notable long-term consequence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). In the current study, we assessed the effects of soya milk containing Lactobacillus casei and omega-3 on stereology of testes in type 1 diabetic rats. METHODS: 30 male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly allocated into five groups. Streptozocin (STZ (60 mg/kg)) was applied for diabetes induction. The non-diabetic and diabetic control groups were fed with 1 ml of distilled water. Three treatment diabetic groups were fed 1 ml of Soy milk group (SM), Probiotic soy milk group (PSM), and Omega-3 probiotic soy milk group (OPSM) via intragastric gavage for 60 days. At the endpoint, the animals were sacrificed and serum luteinizing hormone (LH), Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, MDA besides testicular, and seminal parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: The administration of soy milk supplemented with L. casei and omega-3 in diabetic rats elevated the concentrations of LH, FSH, testosterone, and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA). In addition, this combination improved sperm quality, enhanced the number of sperm with rapid progress, increased testis weight and volume, seminiferous tubule and germinal epithelium volume; and also augmented the number of spermatogonia, spermatocyte, round and long spermatids, Sertoli cells and Leydig cells. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with soy milk containing L. casei and omega-3 can inhibit T1DM-induced infertility rats through improving testicular parameters, enhancing sperm quality, and increasing Sertoli and Leydig cell number.",

      "abstract": "Raw cassava pulp is a low-nutritional agro-industry residue with a high moist content that is susceptible to rot. Biodegradation of cassava pulp by adding Lactobacillus spp. plus stimulants could boost bio-acidity to preserve cassava pulp as ruminant feed. This investigation assessed the effect of ensiled cassava pulp without or with Lactobacillus casei TH14 (LTH14), urea, and molasses on the intake, digestibility, rumen fermentation, and growth performance of native Thai beef cattle. Eight Thai-native beef bulls (170.3 ± 20.2 kg of initial body weight) were randomly assigned to two treatment groups in a completely randomized design: cassava pulp ensiled without additives (CPFNO; n = 4) and cassava pulp ensiled with the combination of LTH14 (2.5 g per ton of fresh material), urea (4% DM), and molasses (4% DM) (CPFWA; n = 4). The intake of the concentrate diet and ensiled cassava pulp did not differ (p > 0.05) between the CPFNO and CPFWA groups, including final body weight, average daily gain (ADG), and feed conversion ratio (p > 0.05). However, CPFWA affected higher rice straw intake compared to the CPFNO group (p < 0.05). The intake and digestibility of crude protein (CP) were greater for the CPFWA group at 43.86% and 30.87%, respectively, compared to the CPFNO group (p < 0.05). Ruminal ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) and blood urea-nitrogen (BUN) were increased when animals were fed with CPFWA (p < 0.05). The average total volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentration of CPFWA was greater than that of CPFNO by 27.49% (p < 0.05). In conclusion, CPFWA supplementation can enhance rice straw intake, CP intake and digestion, total ruminal VFA concentration, and BUN levels, without adversely affecting growth performance.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ulcerative colitis (UC), a common gastrointestinal disorder in affluent nations, involves chronic intestinal mucosal inflammation. This research investigated the effects of combined probiotic treatment of Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) and mesalazine on disease activity index and inflammatory factors in the UC model. METHODS: 20 male BALB/c mice were utilized and divided into four groups. To induce UC, all groups received 100 μL of 4% acetic acid (AA) intra-rectally. The first group received phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (as a control group), the second group was treated with L. casei, the third group was treated with mesalazine and, the fourth group was treated with L. casei and mesalazine. Treatment with L. Casei and mesalazine commenced after the manifestation of symptoms resulting from UC induction. Finally, the mice were euthanized and the disease activity index, myeloperoxidase activity, nitric oxide rate, cytokines level (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and, gene expression (iNOS, COX-2, and cytokines) were evaluated. RESULTS: The combined treatment of L. casei and mesalazine led to a significant decrease in the levels of NO, MPO and inflammatory cytokines. In addition, the expression of cytokines, iNOS and COX-2 genes decreased in mice treated with the combination. DISCUSSION: This study shows that combined treatment of L. casei and mesalazine improves of experimental UC, which can be attributed to the anti-inflammatory properties of L. casei and mesalazine. In conclusion, this combination therapy can be considered a suitable option for the management of UC."

      "abstract": "Selenium (Se) plays a crucial role in modulating inflammation and oxidative stress within the human system. Biogenic selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) synthesized by Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, positioning them as a promising alternative to traditional supplements characterized by limited bioavailability. With this context in mind, this study investigates the impact of selenium and L. casei in ameliorating inflammation and oxidative stress using a cell line model. The study is centered on the biosynthesis of selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) by L. casei 393 under anaerobic conditions using a solution of sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) in the bacterial culture medium. The generation of SeNPs ensued from the interaction of L. casei bacteria with selenium ions, a process characterized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to confirm the synthesis of SeNPs. To induce inflammation, the human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line, Caco-2 was subjected to interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) at concentrations of 0.5 and 25 ng/ml. Subsequent analyses encompass the evaluation of SeNPs derived from L. casei, its supernatant, commercial selenium, and L. casei probiotic on Caco2 cell line. Finally, we assessed the inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. The assessment of inflammation involved the quantification of NF-κB and TGF-β gene expression levels, while oxidative stress was evaluated through the measurement of Nrf2, Keap1, NOX1, and SOD2 gene levels. L. casei successfully produced SeNPs, as confirmed by the color change in the culture medium and TEM analysis showing their uniform distribution within the bacteria. In the inflamed Caco-2 cell line, the NF-κB gene was upregulated, but treatment with L. casei-SeNPs and selenium increased TGF-β expression. Moreover, L. casei-SeNPs upregulated SOD2 and Nrf2 genes, while downregulating NOX1, Keap1, and NF-κB genes. These results demonstrated the potential of L. casei-SeNPs for reducing inflammation and managing oxidative stress in the Caco-2 cell line. The study underscores the ability of L. casei-SeNPs to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in inflamed Caco-2 cell lines, emphasizing the effectiveness of L. casei as a source of selenium. These insights hold significant promise for the development of SeNPs derived from L. casei as potent anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer agents, paving the way for novel therapeutic applications in the field.",

Our previous studies found that pretreatment with live Lac.z (L-Lac.z) could significantly attenuate acute kidney injury and delay the progression of chronic renal fibrosis. However, it is unknown whether these effects could be maintained by pasteurized Lac.z (P-Lac.z). Mouse models of acute kidney injury and chronic renal fibrosis induced by renal bilateral ischemia-reperfusion (BIR) surgery were treated with L-Lac.z or P-Lac.z by gavage. Serum and kidney samples were collected to analyze the extent of renal injury and fibrosis, and proteomics was used to explore the potential mechanisms underlying the differences in the effects of the two forms of Lac.z. The results revealed that treatment with L-Lac.z led to a reduction in serum urea nitrogen levels and in less renal tubular injury and subsequent renal fibrosis after BIR-induced renal injury, whereas these effects were not observed in the P-Lac.z group. Proteomic analysis revealed 19 up-regulated proteins and 39 down-regulated proteins in the P-Lac.z group, and these gene products were associated with growth and stress resistance. The specific nephroprotective effects of L-Lac.z may be independent of the interaction of live probiotics with the host.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prolonged alcohol consumption may lead to gastrointestinal tract dysfunction and cause abnormalities in the associated nervous system activity, thereby increasing the body's craving for alcohol. Lactobacillus casei is a probiotic that has been shown to reduce the incidence of alcohol-related diseases. However, it is unclear whether Lactobacillus casei can delay the development of alcohol dependence. METHODS: The chronic intermittent active drinking method was used to establish a mouse alcohol dependence model. The mice were randomly divided into 4 treatment groups, as follows: (1) Control group: two bottles of distilled water alternately, 0.2 mL/d saline gavage. (2) Alcohol group: alternating water and alcohol, 0.2 mL/d saline gavage. (3) Low group: alternating water and alcohol, 0.2 mL/d 1 × 108CFU of Lactobacillus casei by gavage. (4) High group: alternating water and alcohol, 0.2 mL/d 1 × 109CFU of Lactobacillus casei by gavage. The daily water consumption (mL), alcohol consumption (mL) and body weight of each mouse were recorded. After that, pathological changes in the intestines, brain tissues and serum of the experimental animals were detected, while changes in the intestinal flora of the mice were analysed by 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: The Lactobacillus casei intervention did not produce a significant effect on body weight in alcohol-exposed mice (P>0.05), but significantly reduced alcohol preference in alcohol-exposed mice (P<0.05). Subsequent analyses showed that Lactobacillus casei significantly ameliorated intestinal, brain tissue, and systemic inflammatory responses in alcohol-exposed mice (P<0.05). 16S rRNA sequencing showed that alcohol-exposed mice treated with Lactobacillus casei exhibited a richer composition of intestinal microorganisms, such as f__Rikenellaceae, g__Alistipes_A_871400, and g__Bacteroides_H genera showed relative enrichment in the High group. CONCLUSION: By showing that Lactobacillus casei slows down alcohol preference and alleviates gut and brain tissue inflammation in alcohol-exposed mice, our findings provide a possible strategy: Lactobacillus casei may be able to serve as a potential target for the prevention and treatment of alcohol dependence.",

Reusing whey can help minimize environmental impact and produce bio-preservatives for foods with high bacterial loads, such as Mexican-style fresh cheeses. This research aims to evaluate the antimicrobial and physicochemical effect of CFS from Lactobacillus casei 21/1 produced in a conventional culture medium (MRS broth) and another medium using whey (WB medium) when applied in Mexican-style fresh cheese inoculated with several indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes). The CFSs (MRS or WB) were characterized for organic acids concentration, pH, and titratable acidity. By surface spreading, CFSs were tested on indicator bacteria inoculated in fresh cheese. Microbial counts were performed on inoculated cheeses during and after seven days of storage at 4 ± 1.0 °C. Moreover, pH and color were determined in cheeses with CFS treatment. Lactic and acetic acid were identified as the primary antimicrobial metabolites produced by the Lb. casei 21/1 fermentation in the food application. A longer storage time (7 days) led to significant reductions (p < 0.05) in the microbial population of the indicator bacteria inoculated in the cheese when it was treated with the CFSs (MRS or WB). S. enterica serovar Typhimurium was the most sensitive bacteria, decreasing 1.60 ± 0.04 log10 CFU/g with MRS-CFS, whereas WB-CFS reduced the microbial population of L. monocytogenes to 1.67 log10 CFU/g. E. coli and S. aureus were the most resistant at the end of storage. The cheese's pH with CFSs (MRS or WB) showed a significant reduction (p < 0.05) after CFS treatment, while the application of WB-CFS did not show greater differences in color (ΔE) compared with MRS-CFS. This study highlights the potential of CFS from Lb. casei 21/1 in the WB medium as an ecological bio-preservative for Mexican-style fresh cheese, aligning with the objectives of sustainable food production and guaranteeing food safety.",

Umbilical cord stem cells are among the most well-known cell types for this purpose. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the pretreatment of the foreskin acellular matrix (FAM) by monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) and Lactobacillus casei supernatant (LCS) on the attraction of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSC). METHODS AND RESULTS: The expression of certain cell migration genes was studied using qRT-PCR. In addition to cell migration, transdifferentiation of these cells to the epidermal-like cells was evaluated via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunocytochemistry (ICC) of cytokeratin 19 (CK19). The hucMSC showed more tissue tropism in the presence of MPLA and LCS pretreated FAM compared to the untreated control group. We confirmed this result by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, glycosaminoglycan (GAG), collagen, and DNA content. Furthermore, IHC and ICC data demonstrated that both treatments increase the protein expression level of CK19. CONCLUSION: Pretreatment of acellular bioscaffolds by MPLA or LCS can increase the migration rate of cells and also transdifferentiation of hucMSC to epidermal-like cells without growth factors. This strategy suggests a new approach in regenerative medicine.",

Postbiotics have recently emerged as a promising novel adjunct in breast cancer therapy, due to their immunomodulatory effects and the potential to mitigate the adverse effects of conventional treatments. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects of postbiotics derived from Lactobacillus brevis (CSF2) and Lactobacillus casei (CFS5), specifically examining their ability to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In the current study, the anticancer activity of the cell-free supernatant of L. brevis and L. casei was investigated against MCF-7 cells using MTT assay, flow cytometry, and qRT-PCR technique. Both bacteria showed a high potential for the induction of cell death in MCF-7 cells. However, CFS2 cytotoxicity was significantly higher than CFS5. Flow cytometry results showed significant induction of early apoptosis in cells treated with both CFS2 and CFS5 within 48 h. The induction was notably higher in cells treated with CFS2 compared to CFS5. Overall, CFS2 therapy resulted in a greater increase in BAX and CASP9 gene expression, as well as an elevated BAX/BCL2 ratio within 48 h. These findings indicate that the CFS2 treatment showed a higher level of apoptotic activity than the CFS5 treatment. High biocompatibility was demonstrated following treatment with CFS2 and CFS5. These CFSs may serve as adjunctive medications for suppressing the proliferation of cancer cells. The results of the current study highlight the potential of postbiotics in cancer treatment and suggest that supernatants may serve as effective agents for suppressing cancer cell growth and viability."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is prevalent in as many as 25% of adults who are afflicted with metabolic syndrome. Oxidative stress plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of hepatic and renal injury associated with NAFLD. Therefore, probiotics such as Lactobacillus casei (LBC) and the microalga Chlorella vulgaris (CV) may be beneficial in alleviating kidney injury related to NAFLD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This animal study utilized 30 C57BL/6 mice, which were evenly distributed into five groups: the control group, the NAFLD group, the NAFLD + CV group, the NAFLD + LBC group, and the NAFLD + CV + LBC group. A high-fat diet (HFD) was administered to induce NAFLD for six weeks. The treatments with CV and LBC were continued for an additional 35 days. Biochemical parameters, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and the expression of kidney damage marker genes (KIM 1 and NGAL) in serum and kidney tissue were determined, respectively. A stereological analysis was conducted to observe the structural changes in kidney tissues. RESULTS: A liver histopathological examination confirmed the successful induction of NAFLD. Biochemical investigations revealed that the NAFLD group exhibited increased ALT and AST levels, significantly reduced in the therapy groups (p < 0.001). The gene expression levels of KIM-1 and NGAL were elevated in NAFLD but were significantly reduced by CV and LBC therapies (p < 0.001). Stereological examinations revealed reduced kidney size, volume, and tissue composition in the NAFLD group, with significant improvements observed in the treated groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential therapeutic efficacy of C. vulgaris and L. casei in mitigating kidney damage caused by NAFLD. These findings provide valuable insights for developing novel treatment approaches for managing NAFLD and its associated complications.",

The high demand for catfish must be supplemented by preventive measures against pathogenic bacterial infections using probiotics with high potential for Lactobacillus casei and Bacillus subtilis. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of probiotic supplementation consisting of a combination of L. casei and B. subtilis probiotics on the growth, immune system, water quality, proximate value of feed, and body composition of catfish infected with Aeromonas hydrophila. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used a completely randomized study with eight treatments and three replications. The manipulated factor was the probiotic concentration [0% (A), 0.5% (B), 10% (C), and 15% (D)] in groups of catfish infected and uninfected with A. hydrophila. Combination of B. subtilis, and L. casei that were used in a 1:1 ratio of 108 colony forming unit/mL. The study lasted for 42 days. On the 35th day, A. hydrophila was infected by intramuscular injection into fish. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 23.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics) was used to analyze data on growth, immune system, and water quality. RESULTS: Providing probiotics in feed can increase the nutritional value of feed based on proximate test results. There were significant differences in average daily gain (ADG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and survival rate (SR) parameters in the group of catfish infected with A. hydrophila (p > 0.05); however, there were no significant differences in final body weight, specific growth rate (SGR), and percentage weight gain. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels were significantly different between treatments C and D. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α parameters were significantly different between treatments A and C, whereas the phagocytic activity of treatment A was significantly different from that of treatment D. There was a significant difference (p > 0.05) in the growth parameters of SGR, ADG, and FCR in the group of fish that were not infected with A. hydrophila, with the best treatment being a probiotic concentration of 15%, but there was no significant difference in the SR parameters. IL-1β and TNF-α levels significantly differed between E and E0 (15% probiotics) but were not significantly different in terms of phagocytosis parameters. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that using a combination of probiotics L. casei and B. subtilis can improve the growth, immune system, water quality, proximate value of feed, and body composition of catfish infected with A. hydrophila."

Many studies have proven that probiotics and vitamin D3 have antitumor and intestinal tissue-protecting properties. To achieve effectiveness and minimize side effects, the current study aims to administer Dox together with probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei) and vitamin D3. Forty-two female BALB/c inbred mice were divided into six groups: Group 1 (Control), Group 2 (Dox), Group 3 (Dox and probiotics), Group 4 (Dox and vitamin D3), Group 5 (Dox, probiotics, and vitamin D3), and Group 6 (probiotics and vitamin D3). The 4T1 mouse carcinoma cell line was injected into the mammary fat pad of each mouse. Gene expression was examined using quantitative real-time PCR. The treated groups (except group 6) showed significantly reduced tumor volume and weight compared to the control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Probiotics/vitamin D3 with Dox reduced chemotherapy toxicity and a combination of supplements had a significant protective effect against Dox (P < 0.05, 0.01, 0.001). The treated groups (except 6) had significantly higher expression of Bax/Caspase 3 genes and lower expression of Bcl-2 genes than the control group (P < 0.05, 0.01).

We previously showed, by intraperitoneal injection of Lactobacillus casei cell wall extract (LCWE), C57BL/6 mice develop mild kidney damage in association with glomerular IgA deposition. To further address complement activity in causing glomerular histological alterations as suggested in the pathogenesis of IgAN, here we used mice with factor H mutation (FHW/R) to render AP overactivation in conjunction with LCWE injection to stimulate intestinal production of IgA. METHODS: Dose response to LCWE were examined between two groups of FHW/R mice. Wild type (FHW/W) mice stimulated with LCWE were used as model control. RESULTS: The FHW/R mice primed with high dose LCWE showed elevated IgA and IgA-IgG complex levels in serum. In addition to 100% positive rate of IgA and C3, they display elevated biomarkers of kidney dysfunction, coincided with severe pathological lesions, resembling those of IgAN. As compared to wild type controls stimulated by the same high dose LCWE, these FHW/R mice exhibited stronger complement activation in the kidney and in circulation. DISCUSSION: The new mouse model shares many disease features with IgAN. The severity of glomerular lesions and the decline of kidney functions are further aggravated through complement overactivation. The model may be a useful tool for preclinical evaluation of treatment response to complement-inhibitors.",

LcS or placebo was given once daily for the duration of an antibiotic course and continued for 7 days thereafter. The trial was registered with ISRCTN:13119162. SETTING: Three SCI centres (National Spinal Injuries Centre, Midland Centre for Spinal Injuries and Princess Royal Spinal Cord Injuries Centre) in the United Kingdom METHODS: Between November 2014, and November 2019, 95 eligible consenting SCI patients (median age: 57; IQ range: 43-69) were randomly allocated to receive LcS (n = 50) or placebo (n = 45). The primary outcome is the occurrence of AAD up to 30 days after finishing LcS/placebo. RESULTS: The LcS group had a significantly lower incidence of AAD at 30 days after finishing the antibiotic course (28.0 v 53.3%, RR: 95% CI: 0.53, 0.31-0.89; z = 2.5, p = 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that LcS can reduce the risk of AAD at 30 days (OR: 0.36, 95% CI 0.13, 0.99, p < 0.05). No intervention-related adverse events were reported during the study. CONCLUSIONS: LcS has the potential to prevent AAD in what could be considered a defined vulnerable group of SCI patients on regular PPI. A confirmatory, randomised, placebo-controlled study is needed to confirm this apparent therapeutic success to translate it into appropriate clinical outcomes. SPONSORSHIP: Yakult Honsha Co., Ltd.",

Methods: Five percents DMAEM was added to the resin adhesive to synthesize DMAEM@RA for modifying. Streptococcus mutans (Sm) and Lactobacillus casei (Lc) biofilms were cultured on resin adhesive and DMAEM@RA, respectively. The culture systems were set up at pH=7.4, 6.0, 5.5, and 5.0. The antimicrobial activity of DMAEM@RA was evaluated by quantitative PCR. The effects of DMAEM@RA on biofilm thickness, bacterial amount, and extracellular polysaccharides were studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and extracellular polysaccharide staining. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to study the effect of DMAEM@RA on the expression levels of cariogenic genes in Sm. Results: DMAEM@RA could significantly reduce the amount of Sm and Lc under acidic conditions, especially Lc. At pH=5.0, the logarithm value of co-cultured Sm bacteria [lg (CFU/ml)] in DMAEM@RA group (7.58±0.01) was significantly lower than that in control group (7.87±0.03) (t=14.32, P<0.001), and the logarithm value of Lc bacteria [lg (CFU/ml)] (7.29±0.04) was also significantly lower than that in control group (7.93±0.15) (t=6.93, P=0.002). SEM observed that the bacteria decreased and the cell fragments appeared in DMAEM@RA group. In addition, DMAEM@RA significantly reduced the biomass of extracellular polysaccharides in the dual-species biofilm under acidic conditions. At pH=5.0, the biomass of extracellular polysaccharides in DMAEM@RA group [(25.13±3.14) mm3/mm2] was significantly lower than that in the control group [(42.66±7.46) mm3/mm2] (t=3.75, P=0.020). DMAEM@RA could significantly up-regulate the expressions of gtfB and gtfC genes in Sm under acidic conditions. At pH=5.0, gtfB and gtfC genes were significantly up-regulated by (14.64± 0.44) times and (2.99±0.20) times, respectively (t=-42.74, P<0.001; t=-13.55, P<0.001). Conclusions: The DMAEM@RA has a good antibacterial effect under acidic conditions, demonstrating that it has a good potential to prevent the occurrence and development of secondary caries.",

The oxidative stress identified by catalase (CAT), serum AST, ALT, ALP, creatinine, urea, and uric acid were measured. The chemical profiles of the plant extract and the fermented extract were studied using HPLC/MS. The potential of the compounds towards the binding pockets of aldose reductase and PPAR was discovered by molecular docking. A significant reduction in fasting blood glucose in alloxan-treated rats. The CAT showed a significant decrease in diabetic rats. Also, serum AST, ALT, ALP, creatinine, urea, and uric acid were significantly decreased in the mixture group. Mild histological changes of pancreatic and kidney tissues suggested that the mixture of probiotics and cleome possesses a marked anti-diabetic effect. Overall, the study suggests that the combination of Cleome droserifolia fermented by Lactobacillus casei exhibits significant antidiabetic activity (p-value=0.05), reduces oxidative stress, improves lipid profiles, and shows potential for the treatment of diabetes.",

Various concentrations of curcumin (1.5 g/L, 3 g/L), nano-curcumin (3 g/L), and erythrosine (100 µM/L, 250 µM/L) were tested either alone or combined with light irradiation (PDT effect) against L. casei in planktonic and biofilm cultures. The light was emitted from a light-emitting diode (LED) with a central wavelength of 450 nm. A 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) solution served as the positive control, and a solution containing neither photosensitizer nor light was the negative control group. The number of viable microorganisms was determined using serial dilution. There was a significant difference in the viability of L. casei in both planktonic and biofilm forms (P < 0.05). In the planktonic culture, the antibacterial effects of CHX and PDT groups with curcumin 3 g/L and erythrosine 250 µM/L were significantly greater than the other groups (P < 0.05). For L. casei biofilms, the greatest toxic effects were observed in CHX and PDT groups with curcumin 3 g/L, erythrosine 250 µmol/L, erythrosine 100 µmol/L, and nanomicelle curcumin 3 g/L, with a significant difference to other groups (P < 0.05). The antibacterial effects of all photosensitizers (except erythrosine 250 µmol/L at planktonic culture) enhanced significantly when combined with light irradiation (P < 0.05). PDT with curcumin 3 g/L or erythrosine 250 µmol/L produced comparable results to CHX against L. casei at both planktonic and biofilm cultures. Alternatively, PDT with erythrosine 100 µmol/L or nanomicelle curcumin 3 g/L could be suggested to kill L. casei biofilms.",

Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanisms underpinning these effects remain elusive. Recent investigations have proposed a potential involvement of micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) in mediating the favorable influence of probiotics on cancerous cells. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus casei condition medium on miR-21 relative expression in HT-29 colorectal cancer cells. Lactobacillus casei condition medium mixed with RPMI in different proportions (1:1, 1:3, and 1:7) and utilized to treat HT-29 cells for 24 and 48 h. Subsequently, percentage of early and late apoptotic cells were identified using a flow cytometry instrument. A real-time polymerase chain reaction was carried out to determine the relative expression of miR-21. Our findings revealed that L. casei condition medium induces apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner in HT-29 cells. Furthermore, we found a significantly downregulated miR-21 after treatment with high doses of L. casei condition medium after 48 h. Overall, our results provide valuable insights into a potential mechanism through which L. casei condition medium mediates its apoptotic effect in colorectal cancer cells through downregulation of miR-21. However, further investigations are required to unravel its therapeutic, diagnostic, and treatment monitoring potential."

Cross-talk between gut microbiota and brain has an important role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders and regenerative processes. However, choosing the appropriate probiotics and combination therapy of probiotics to provide a synergistic effect is very crucial. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) and Bifidobacterium breve (B. breve) on alternation performance, oxidant/antioxidant biomarkers, the extent of demyelination, and the expression level of HO-1, Nrf-2, Olig2, MBP, PDGFRα, and BDNF in cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination model of rat corpus callosum. In order to induce this model, rats received oral administration of CPZ 0.6% w/w in corn oil for 28 days. Then, L. casei, B. breve, or their combinations were orally administrated for 28 days. Y maze test was performed to investigate the alternation performance. Oxidant/antioxidant biomarkers were determined by colorimetric methods. Extent of demyelination was investigated using FluoroMyelin staining. The genes' expression levels of antioxidant and myelin lineage cells were assessed by quantitative real time PCR. The results showed the probiotics supplementation significantly improve the alternation performance and antioxidant capacity in demyelinated corpus callosum. Interestingly, B. breve supplementation alleviated demyelination and oxidative stress levels more than the administration of L. casei alone or the combination of two probiotics. These observations suggest that B. breve could provide a supplementary strategy for the treatment of multiple sclerosis by increasing antioxidant capacity and remyelination.",

Oncolytic viruses and bacteria in treating CRC are one of the innovative therapeutic options. This study aims to determine whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) infected with the Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) in combination with Lactobacillus casei extract (L. casei) have a synergistic effects on CRC cell line growth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MSCs taken from the bone marrow of BALB/c mice and were infected with the 20 MOI of NDV. Then, using the CT26 cell line in various groups as a single and combined treatment, the anticancer potential of MSCs containing the NDV and L. casei extract was examined. The evaluations considered the CT26 survival and the rate at which LDH, ROS, and levels of caspases eight and nine were produced following various treatments. RESULTS: NDV, MSCs-NDV, and L. casei in alone or combined treatment significantly increased apoptosis percent, LDH, and ROS production compared with the control group (P˂0.05). Also, NDV, in free or capsulated in MSCs, had anticancer effects, but in capsulated form, it had a delay compared with free NDV. The findings proved that L. casei primarily stimulates the extrinsic pathway, while NDV therapy promotes apoptosis through the activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that MSCs carrying oncolytic NDV in combination with L. casei extract as a potentially effective strategy for cancer immunotherapy by promoting the generation of LDH, ROS, and apoptosis in the microenvironment of the CT26 cell line."

We have used them in the food industry as probiotics and supplements. In some settings, rod-shaped lactic acid bacteria may become pathogenic. It may occur in immunocompromised or heart disease patients after cardiac surgery, patients with disturbed intestinal wall permeability, or those treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. CASE PRESENTATION: We present rare bacteraemia induced by the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus casei in a 63-year-old patient after the attempted removal of ICD electrodes, complicated by acute regurgitation of the tricuspid valve. The patient underwent urgent cardiac surgery, the electrode elements were removed, and the tricuspid valve was replaced with a biological prosthesis. After surgery, the patient required intensive, multidisciplinary treatment with mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy, broad-spectrum empirical antibiotic therapy, parenteral nutrition, and blood product transfusion because of multiple organ failure. On the 14th day of hospitalisation, the clinical symptoms of septic shock were observed. The microbiological investigation was performed, and Lactobacillus casei was cultured from a dialysis catheter sample. Dedicated antimicrobials were administered, and the patient was discharged home in good overall condition. CONCLUSIONS: The present case shows that the promoted use of probiotics must be cautiously administered to patients in severe conditions, especially when accompanied by reduced immune system efficiency symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Peritoneal fibrosis is a complication of long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) that restricts its clinical application for the treatment of end-stage renal disease. Lactobacillus casei Zhang (LCZ), a probiotic strain isolated from traditional fermented koumiss, exhibits health benefits such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects, improvement of insulin resistance and mitigation of renal injury. However, whether LCZ can prevent peritoneal fibrosis remains unknown. Here, we assessed the effects of LCZ in a mouse model of PD-induced peritoneal fibrosis. Our results showed that the administration of LCZ significantly ameliorated peritoneal fibrosis in experimental mice. Macrophage infiltration, inflammatory M1 polarization and inflammatory cytokines in peritoneal dialysis effluents were effectively reduced by LCZ. Meanwhile, LCZ corrected gut dysbiosis and enriched beneficial bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids, specifically Dubosiella, Lachnospiraceae, Parvibacter, and Butyricicoccus. Correspondingly, the local butyrate level in peritoneal dialysis effluents was significantly elevated by LCZ. Mechanistically, we found activation of PPARγ and inhibition of the NF-κB pathway in LCZ-treated mice, an observation that was replicated in a butyrate-treated macrophage cell line. In conclusion, our study suggests that LCZ is beneficial for preventing PD-induced peritoneal fibrosis through modulating the gut microbiota, enhancing butyrate production, activating PPARγ, and suppressing NF-κB-mediated inflammation.",

      "abstract": "As a leading global cause of mortality, cancer continues to pose a significant challenge. The shortcomings of prevalent cancer treatments, such as surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, necessitate the exploration of alternative therapeutic strategies. Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) have emerged as a promising solution, with their synthesis being widely researched due to their potential applications. Among the diverse synthesis methods for SeNPs, the green chemistry approach holds a distinctive position within nanotechnology. This research delves into the anti-proliferative and anticancer properties of green-synthesized SeNPs via the cell-free supernatant (CFS) of Lactobacillus casei (LC-SeNPs), with a specific focus on MCF-7 and HT-29 cancer cell lines. SeNPs were synthesized employing the supernatant of L. casei. The characterization of these green-synthesized SeNPs was performed using TEM, FE-SEM, XRD, FT-IR, UV-vis, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and DLS. The biological impact of LC-SNPs on MCF-7 and HT-29 cancer cells was examined via MTT, flow cytometry, scratch tests, and qRT-PCR. Both FE-SEM and TEM images substantiated the spherical shape of the synthesized nanoparticles. The biosynthesized LC-SNPs reduced the survival of MCF-7 (by 20%) and HT-29 (by 30%) cells at a concentration of 100 μg/mL. Flow cytometry revealed that LC-SNPs were capable of inducing 28% and 23% apoptosis in MCF-7 and HT-29 cells, respectively. In addition, it was found that LC-SNPs treated MCF-7 and HT-29 cells were arrested in the sub-G1 phase. Gene expression analysis indicated that the expression levels of the CASP3, CASP9, and BAX genes were elevated after treating MCF-7 and HT-29 cells with LC-SNPs. Further, SeNPs were observed to inhibit migration and invasion of MCF-7 and HT-29 cancer cells. The SeNPs, produced via L. casei, demonstrated strong anticancer effects on MCF-7 and HT-29 cells, suggesting their potential as biological agents in cancer treatment following additional in vivo experiments.",

The CON was not treated, while the MEM was treated with the mixture of L. casei (1 × 107 CFU/mL) and S. cerevisiae (1 × 107 CFU/mL) at 3 mL/pig/day for 4  weeks via the drinking water supply. Two feces and one blood sample from the randomly selected pigs in each pen were collected on D1 and D28 after weaning. Pigs were individually weighed, and pen feed intakes were recorded to evaluate pig growth performance. For the gut microbiome analysis, 16S rRNA gene hypervariable regions (V5 to V6) were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform, and Quantitative Insight into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) and Microbiome Helper pipeline were used for 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The daily weight gain and feed efficiency of MEM were significantly higher than those of CON (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in hematological parameters and immune responses between CON and MEM. However, MEM had significantly lower Treponema genus, whereas significantly higher Lactobacillus and Roseburia genera compared to CON. Overall, our data showed that L. casei and S. cerevisiae mixture could promote growth performance through the modulation of gut microbiota in pigs. This study will help to understand the correlation between the growth performance and the gut microbiome."

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) which is related to an immunological imbalance of the intestinal mucosa. Many clinical evidences indicate probiotics supplementation appears to be effective and safe in patients with UC. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is an endogenous neuropeptide with multiple physiological and pathological effects. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of the combination of Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 (L. casei ATCC 393) with VIP on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC in mice and the potential mechanism. The results showed that, compared with the control group, DSS treatment significantly shortened the colon length, caused inflammation and oxidative stress, and further resulted in the intestinal barrier dysfunction and gut microbiota dysbiosis. In addition, intervention with L. casei ATCC 393, VIP or L. casei ATCC 393 combined with VIP significantly reduced UC disease activity index. However, compared with L. casei ATCC 393 or VIP, L. casei ATCC 393 combined with VIP effectively relieved symptoms of UC by regulating immune response, enhancing antioxidant capacity, and regulating nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and nuclear factor erythroid-derived-2-like 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathways. In conclusion, this study suggests that L. casei ATCC 393 combined with VIP can effectively relieve DSS-induced UC, which is a promising treatment strategy for UC.",

An alternative to the treatment of infections caused by these microorganisms is the use of the bacteria of the Lactobacillus genus; however, the beneficial effects on the intestinal mucosa are specific to the strain and species. The interest of this study consisted of analyzing the coaggregation properties of Lactobacillus casei IMAU60214, as well as the effect of cell-free supernatant (CSF) on growth and anti-cytotoxic activity in a cell model of the human intestinal epithelium for an agar diffusion assay (HT-29) and the inhibition of biofilm formation on plates of DEC strains of the EAEC and EHEC pathotypes. The results showed that L. casei IMAU60214 exhibits time-dependent coaggregation (35-40%) against EAEC and EHEC that is similar to the control E. coli ATCC 25922. The CSF showed antimicrobial activity (20-80%) against EAEC and EHEC depending on the concentration. In addition, the formation and dispersion of biofilms of the same strains decrease, and the proteolytic pre-treatment with catalase and/or proteinase K (1 mg/mL) of CSF reduces the antimicrobial effect. When evaluating the effect in HT-29 cells pre-treated with CFS on the toxic activity induced by the EAEC and EHEC strains, a reduction of between 30 and 40% was observed. The results show that L. casei IMAU60214 and its CSF have properties that interfere with some properties associated with the virulence of the EAEC and EHEC strains that cause intestinal infection, which supports their use for the control and prevention of infections caused by these bacteria."

      "abstract": "The gut-liver axis may provide a new perspective for treating anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury (ATDILI). Herein, the protective effect of Lactobacillus casei (Lc) was investigated by modulating gut microflora (GM) and the toll like receptor 4 (TLR4)-nuclear factor (NF)-κB-myeloiddifferentiationfactor 88 (MyD88) pathway. C57BL/6J mice were given three levels of Lc intragastrically for 2 h before administering isoniazid and rifampicin for 8 weeks. Blood, liver, and colon tissues, as well as cecal contents, were collected for biochemical and histological examination, as well as Western blot, quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and 16S rRNA analyses. Lc intervention decreased alkaline phosphatase (ALP), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels (p < 0.05), recovered hepatic lobules, and reduced hepatocyte necrosis to alleviate liver injury induced by anti-tuberculosis drugs. Moreover, Lc also increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Desulfovibrio and decreased Bilophila abundance, while enhancing zona occludens (ZO)-1 and claudin-1 protein expression compared with the model group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, Lc pretreatment reduced the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) level and downregulated NF-κB and MyD88 protein expression (p < 0.05), thus restraining pathway activation. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that Lactobacillus and Desulfovibrio were positively correlated with ZO-1 or occludin protein expression and negatively correlated with pathway protein expression. Desulfovibrio had significant negative relationships with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and LPS levels. In contrast, Bilophila had negative associations with ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1 protein expressions and positive correlations with LPS and pathway proteins. The results prove that Lactobacillus casei can enhance the intestinal barrier and change the composition of the gut microflora. Moreover, Lactobacillus casei may also inhibit TLR4-NF-κB-MyD88 pathway activation and alleviate ATDILI.",

      "abstract": "Microorganisms capable of converting toxic selenite into elemental selenium (Se0) are considered an important and effective approach for bioremediation of Se contamination. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of reducing selenite to Se0 and forming Se nanoparticles (SeNPs) by food-grade probiotic Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 (L. casei ATCC 393) through proteomics analysis. The results showed that selenite added during the exponential growth period of bacteria has the highest reduction efficiency, and 4.0 mM selenite decreased by nearly 95% within 72 h and formed protein-capped-SeNPs. Proteomics analysis revealed that selenite induced a significant increase in the expression of glutaredoxin, oxidoreductase, and ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, which can transport glutathione (GSH) and selenite. Selenite treatment significantly increased the CydC and CydD (putative cysteine and glutathione importer, ABC transporter) mRNA expression level, GSH content, and GSH reductase activity. Furthermore, supplementation with an additional GSH significantly increased the reduction rate of selenite, while GSH depletion significantly inhibited the reduction of selenite, indicating that GSH-mediated Painter-type reaction may be the main pathway of selenite reduction in L. casei ATCC 393. Moreover, nitrate reductase also participates in the reduction process of selenite, but it is not the primary factor. Overall, L. casei ATCC 393 effectively reduced selenite to SeNPs by GSH and nitrate reductase-mediated reduction pathway, and the GSH pathway played the decisive role, which provides an environmentally friendly biocatalyst for the bioremediation of Se contamination. IMPORTANCE Due to the high solubility and bioavailability of selenite, and its widespread use in industrial and agricultural production, it is easy to cause selenite to accumulate in the environment and reach toxic levels. Although the bacteria screened from special environments have high selenite tolerance, their safety has not been fully verified. It is necessary to screen out strains with selenite-reducing ability from nonpathogenic, functionally known, and widely used strains. Herein, we found food-grade probiotic L. casei ATCC 393 effectively reduced selenite to SeNPs by GSH and nitrate reductase-mediated reduction pathway, which provides an environmentally friendly biocatalyst for the bioremediation of Se contamination.",

Pregnant women with intermediate microbiota of the vagina and a Nugent score of 4 were enrolled in two groups: intermediate vaginal microbiota and a Nugent score of 4 with lactobacilli (IMLN4) and intermediate vaginal microbiota and a Nugent score of 4 without lactobacilli (IM0N4), with and without vaginal lactobacilli at baseline, respectively.

      "abstract": "Campylobacter is one of the most common foodborne bacterial pathogens causing illness, known as campylobacteriosis, in the United States. More than 70% of the campylobacteriosis cases have direct or indirect relation with poultry/poultry products. Currently, both conventional and organic/pasture poultry farmers are searching for sustainable alternative to antibiotics which can reduce colonization and cross-contamination of poultry products with Campylobacter and promote poultry health and growth. Probiotic and their nutritional supplement, known as prebiotic, have become consumers' preferences as alternatives to antibiotics/chemicals. In this study, we evaluated the combined effect of plant-derived prebiotic and probiotic-derived metabolites in reducing growth of Campylobacter in cecum contents, a simulated chicken gut condition. Cecum contents were collected from chickens pre-inoculated with kanamycin-resistant Campylobacter (CJRMKm), were incubated over 48 h time period, while being supplemented with either berry phenolic extract (BPE), cell free cultural supernatant from an engineered probiotic, Lactobacillus casei, or their combination. It was found that combine treatments were able to reduce both inoculated and naturally colonized Campylobacter more effectively. Microbiome analysis using 16S rRNA sequencing also revealed that combine treatments were capable to alter natural microflora positively within chicken cecum contents. Differences were observed in bacterial abundance at both phylum and genus level but did not show significant alteration in alpha diversity due to this treatment. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The results of this study provide critical information for understanding the potential of synbiotic as an alternative in sustainable poultry farming. The outcomes of this study will lead future direction of using combination of probiotic-derived metabolites and BPE in poultry farming.",

Results indicated that L. casei NCU011054 could increase the levels of mucin (Muc2) and tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1). Moreover, L. casei NCU011054 was found to upregulate TLRs/NF-κB pathway (TLR-2, TLR-4, TLR-6, p65 and NF-κB) and two transcription factors (T-bet and GATA-3) mRNA levels, and enhance the number of CD4+T cells. Th1-related cytokines (IL-12p70, IFN-γ and TNF-α) and Th2-related cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10) significantly increased after L. casei NCU011054 treatment.

Studies on germ-free mice have shown that gut microbiota is critical for bone growth and development in mice, emphasizing that microbiota dysbiosis may interfere with normal bone development processes. This study aimed to clarify the effect of antibiotic treatment on disturbed gut microbiota on bone development in mice and to investigate the effect of probiotic treatment on fracture healing in mice with dysbiosis. Our results showed that 4 weeks old female Kunming mice showed significantly lower abundance and diversity of the gut microbiota and significantly lower bone mineral density after 12 weeks of antibiotic treatment and significantly increased levels of RANKL and Ang II in serum (p<0.05). Mice with dysbiosis received 5 mL of Lactobacillus casei fermented milk by daily gavage after internal fixation of femoral fractures, and postoperative fracture healing was evaluated by X-ray, micro-CT scan, and HE staining, which showed faster growth of the broken ends of the femur and the presence of more callus. Serological tests showed decreased levels of RANKL and Ang II (p<0.05). Similarly, immunohistochemical results also showed increased expression of α smooth muscle actin in callus tissue. These results suggest that oral antibiotics can lead to dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in mice, which in turn leads to the development of osteoporosis. In contrast, probiotic treatment promoted fracture healing in osteoporotic mice after dysbiosis, and the probiotic effect on fracture healing may be produced by inhibiting the RAS/RANKL/RANK pathway.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The bidirectional communication between the gut and the central nervous system mediated by gut microbiota is closely related to the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Selenium (Se) has been identified as playing a role against AD. Probiotics have beneficial effects on host brain function and behavior by modulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Herein, we evaluated the protective effects of Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 (L. casei ATCC 393) and selenium nanoparticles-enriched L. casei ATCC 393 (L. casei ATCC 393-SeNPs) against D-galactose/aluminum chloride-induced AD model mice. METHODS: The Morris Water Maze (MWM) test was used to assess cognitive function of mice. The morphology and histopathological changes, antioxidant capacity and immune responses in the brain and ileum were evaluated. The alterations in intestinal permeability of the mice were determined using FITC-dextran. Gut microbiota composition was assessed using 16s rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: Thirteen weeks intervention with L. casei ATCC 393 or L. casei ATCC 393-SeNPs significantly improved cognitive dysfunction, and minimized amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregation, hyperphosphorylation of TAU protein, and prevented neuronal death by modulating Akt/cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway. Moreover, compared with L. casei ATCC 393, L. casei ATCC 393-SeNPs further effectively mitigated intestinal barrier dysfunction by improving antioxidant capacity, regulating immune response, restoring gut microbiota balance, and increasing the level of short-chain fatty acids and neurotransmitters, thereby inhibiting the activation of microglia and protecting brain neurons from neurotoxicity such as oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that targeting the microbiota-gut-brain axis with L. casei ATCC 393-SeNPs may have therapeutic potential for the deficits of cognitive function in the AD model mice. Thus, we anticipate that L. casei ATCC 393-SeNPs may be a promising and safe Se nutritional supplement for use as a food additive to prevent the neurodegenerative disease.",

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence indicates that the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAAR) and Lactobacillus casei Zhang regulate colitis in a variety of ways, such as by participating in host immune and inflammatory responses, altering the gut microbiota, and influencing intestinal barrier function. However, not much is known about the mechanisms by which GABAAR and L. casei affect colon epithelial cell renewal and the interaction between GABAAR and L. casei during this process. To elucidate this, we established a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced model and measured the mouse body weights, colon length, the disease activity index (DAI), and histological scores. Our results indicated that inhibition of GABAAR alleviated the DSS-induced colitis symptoms, resulting in less weight loss and more intact colon tissue. Moreover, treatment with bicuculline (Bic, a GABAAR inhibitor) increased the levels of PCNA, β-catenin, and TCF4 in mice with colitis. Interestingly, open field test performances showed that inhibition of GABAAR also attenuated colitis-related anxiety-like behavior. By 16S RNA gene sequencing analysis, we showed that inhibition of GABAAR partially reversed the gut dysbacteriosis of DSS-induced mice and increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria. Additionally, L. casei Zhang supplementation inhibited the expression of GABAAR in mice with colitis, promoted the proliferation and renewal of colon epithelial cells, and alleviated anxiety-like behavior and intestinal microflora disorder in mice. Thus, GABAAR plays a key role in the beneficial effects of L. casei on DSS-induced colitis in mice.",

Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women and is currently treated with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, among other treatments. Current oncology approaches focused on the simultaneous development of safe and effective cancer multi-agent therapies. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of a combined extracts of heated TC1, a heat-killed preparation of Lactobacillus casei, and alpha-galactosyl ceramide (α-GalCer) in a mouse model of cervical cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cervical cancer in the mouse model was prepared by TC1 cells subcutaneous injection into the left flank of female C57BL/6 mouse aged 6-8 weeks (n = 80). After the appearance of the palpable tumor, the mice with cervical cancer were randomly devoted to 8 (ten-member) groups. The mice in some groups were treated with PBS, TC1 cell extract, L. casei extract, α-GalCer, and a combination of the mentioned treatments. Then, they were evaluated the splenocytes proliferation, lactate dehydrogenase production and nitric oxide. Moreover, IL-4, IFN-γ, and TGF-β cytokine levels of splenocytes supernatant the mice were measured. In all evaluations, a statistical difference of less than 0.05 (P ˂ 0.05) was considered as a significant level. RESULT: The findings revealed that the combination therapy group (heated TC1 cell and L. casei extracts with α-GalCer) significantly increases the splenocytes proliferation (MTT) (0.358 ± 0.04 OD), LDH production (45.9 ± 2.3 U/L), NO rate (38.4 ± 2.8 µM), and IFN-γ cytokine level (46.6 ± 3.7 pg/ml) (P < 0.05). Also, observes a significantly reduces the production of IL-4 (11.6 ± 2.5 pg/ml) and TGF-β cytokines levels (7.8 ± 2.5 pg/ml) (P < 0.05) in comparison to the control group. CONCLUSION: The study showed that combination therapy of L. casei and α-GalCer is an efficient treatment for cervical cancer in the mouse model."

      "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of Bacillus coagulans and Lactobacillus casei probiotics on liver damage induced by silver nanoparticles and expression of Bax, Bcl2 and Caspase 3 genes in rats. 32 adult male Wistar rats were divided into four healthy groups (control), the group receiving silver nanoparticles treated with L. casei, the group receiving silver nanoparticles treated with B. coagulans and the group receiving only silver nanoparticles. The effect of nanoparticles was induced by intraperitoneal injection of silver nanoparticles prepared from nettle at a dose of 50 mg/kg and entered the liver tissue through the bloodstream. Two days after injection, probiotic treatment with 109 CFU was performed by gavage for 30 days. One day after the last gavage, rat liver tissue weight was assessed. Also, the total amount of RNA was extracted from treated, and healthy tissues, as well as induced silver nanoparticles tissues, then evaluated by Real Time PCR. Data were evaluated using one-way Anova, Tukey test. Based on the biochemical results of this study, exposure of rats to different concentrations of silver nanoparticles compared with the control group caused a significant increase in the serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), especially at high concentrations. Evaluation of damage and histopathological lesions showed that silver nanoparticles in different concentrations caused different damage to liver tissue, so that, necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and vascular degeneration were observed at different concentrations by silver nanoparticles. In the present study, the effects of L. casei cell extract on increasing the expression of Bax proapoptotic gene and decreasing Bcl2 gene expression in cancer cells and inducing programmed cell death were shown. In this study, the expression of Bax, Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 genes in the group receiving silver nanoparticles and in the groups treated with probiotics showed significant changes compared to the control group. It can be concluded that the function of silver nanoparticles and the effects of relative improvement of probiotics are from the internal route of apoptosis and factors such as dose, nanoparticle size and nanoparticle coating have an important role in the toxicity of silver nanoparticles, thus the destructive effects on liver tissue could be increased by increasing the concentration of silver nanoparticles."

This study aimed to determine whether an oral administration of Lactobacillus casei expressing modified human myostatin (BLS-M22) could elicit sufficient levels of myostatin-specific antibody and improve the dystrophic features of an animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD; mdx mouse). BLS-M22 is a recombinant L. casei engineered to harbor the pKV vector and poly-gamma-glutamic acid gene linked to a modified human myostatin gene. Serological analysis showed that anti-myostatin IgG titers were significantly increased, and serum creatine kinase was significantly reduced in the BLS-M22-treated mdx mice compared to the control mice. In addition, treatment of BLS-M22 resulted in a significant increase in body weight and motor function (Rotarod behavior test). Histological analysis showed an improvement in the dystrophic features (fibrosis and muscle hypertrophy) of the mdx mice with the administration of BLS-M22. The circulating antibodies generated after BLS-M22 oral administration successfully lowered serum myostatin concentration. Myostatin blockade resulted in serological, histological, and functional improvements in mdx mice. Overall, the findings suggest the potential of BLS-M22 to treat DMD; however, further clinical trials are essential to ascertain its efficacy and safety in humans.",

AIM: This study aimed to determine the protective and therapeutic effects of heat-killed preparations of Lactobacillus casei and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a breast cancer mouse model. METHODS: Forty-two female BALB/c mice (7-8 weeks old) were divided into six groups (seven mice per group). Four groups were injected with 107 Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) cells suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) subcutaneously into the left side of the mammary fat pad. Tumor growth was monitored weekly until all animals developed a palpable tumor. The tumor-bearing mice in the experimental groups received heat-killed L. casei or S. cerevisiae three times per week for 35 days. The mice in the control group received PBS. The remaining two groups received heated L. casei or S. cerevisiae and then were injected with EAT cells. After 35 days, all mice were sacrificed to determine the immune response. RESULTS: Animals that received heated S. cerevisiae exhibited the lowest rate of tumor growth compared with the other groups. TGF-β and IL-4 secretion was increased in all mice, whereas the secretion of INF-γ and IL-10 was decreased in breast tissues. Moreover, at the histopathological level, the volume of viable tumor in the control group was higher than in the treated groups. CONCLUSION: Supplementary treatment with S. cerevisiae resulted in the best outcome in the breast cancer model compared with other treated and vaccinated groups."

Chronic inflammatory airway disease is associated with Th2-related cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and Th17-related cytokine IL-17A, which are the major contributors to allergy and asthma. Results indicated that PM2.5 elevates allergen-related airway inflammation and respiratory hyperresponsiveness in C57BL/6 mice. The HY2782 complex significantly reduced Th2/Th17-derived cytokines IL-4, IL5, IL-13, and IL-17A; immunoglobulin E; and leukotriene C4 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum. Furthermore, the HY2782 complex was associated with the modulation of oxidative stress-related genes. Administration of the HY2782 complex resulted in a markedly reduced number of neutrophils and eosinophil infiltration in BALF. Histopathological observation of lung tissue also showed reduced inflammatory cell infiltration into airways and surrounding tissue. The HY2782 complex may be a promising candidate for the preventive therapy of allergic diseases and airway inflammation caused by PM2.5 inhalation."

However, dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) as the current therapy for Pb poisoning exerts relatively significant toxic side effects in infants. Therefore, identifying a non-toxic treatment in this regard is particularly important. In this study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of an infant feces-derived probiotic strain, Lactobacillus casei SYF-08 (SYF-08), on Pb poisoning in young mice. The Pb levels in the organisms were detected via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, while the therapeutic effect of SYF-08 on Pb-induced neural system damage was explored via the Morris water maze test, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and immunohistochemistry. Additionally, the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of SYF-08 against Pb-induced intestinal damage were also explored via histological staining, 16S rRNA sequencing, untargeted metabolomics, qRT-PCR, and western blotting. In vivo experiments revealed that SYF-08 reduced blood and bone Pb levels and increased urinary Pb excretion. Additionally, SYF-08 alleviated Pb-induced pathological damage to the brain and ultimately improved the learning and cognitive abilities of the young mice. This treatment also restored intestinal microflora dysbiosis, regulated bile acid metabolism, and inhibited the FXR-NLRP3 signaling pathway. It also resulted in fewer adverse events than the DMSA treatment. In conclusion, our results provided valuable insights into the therapeutic role of SYF-08 in Pb poisoning and also suggested that its administration can significantly alleviate the Pb-induced damage."

The aim of the present survey was to investigate the protective effects of native Iranian probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L. helveticus, and L. casei) against cadmium (Cd)-induced toxicity against the small intestine and lung at histopathological and biochemical levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one adult male Wistar rats were randomized into three groups of seven rats (control, Cd-treated (3 mg/kg), and concomitant Cd and mix probiotic treatment for 30 days). Histological alterations were appraised via hematoxylin & eosin, Trichrome Masson, and PAS staining. The qRT-PCR technique was applied to assess the expression of pro-apoptotic, anti-apoptotic, and pro-inflammatory genes. Antioxidant enzymes activity was measured via ZellBio kits. RESULTS: Probiotic-treated rats displayed low production of lipid peroxides, reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) level, and elevated contents of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzymes compared with Cd-treated rats. The results of qRT-PCR demonstrated the up-regulation of Bax, p53, and caspase 3 and down-regulation of Bcl2, TNF-α, and IL-6 genes in both the intestine and lungs of mix probiotic-treated rats compared with Cd-treated animals. Histopathological findings revealed that the probiotic formulation improved Cd-triggered tissue damage in the intestine and lungs. CONCLUSION: The strong cytoprotective benefits of Iranian probiotics against Cd-induced tissue injury observed in this study may be due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Therefore, additional clinical and experimental research is required to explain the precise mechanisms of probiotics' beneficial impacts and underline their potential therapeutic use.",

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (L. casei) on iron metabolism and intestinal microflora in rats after alcohol and iron co-exposure. METHODS: Sixty male rats were randomly divided into 3 groups for 12 weeks: the control group: treated with normal saline by gavage and normal diet; the model group: treated with alcohol (8-12 mL/kg/day) by gavage and iron (1500 mg/kg) in diet; the model group supple- mented with L. casei (8 × 108 CFU/kg/day) as the L. casei group. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the levels of serum ferritin, hepcidin, the protein expressions of ferroportin 1 and divalent metal transporter 1 in the model group were significantly increased, while it was significantly decreased after L. casei supplement (P < .05). Compared with the control group, the amount of Lactobacillus of the model group was significantly decreased, while the amount of Bacteroides and Escherichia coli was significantly increased (P < .05). After the supplementation of L. casei, the amount of Lactobacillus increased significantly, while the amount of Bacteroides and E. coli decreased significantly (P < .05). CONCLUSION: L. casei could effectively improve iron metabolism and intestinal flora disorder induced by excessive alcohol and iron. The effective treatment of iron metabolism may be related to the changes of intestinal flora.",

      "abstract": "IHNV is a virus that infects salmonids and causes serious economic damage to the salmonid farming industry. There is no specific treatment for the disease caused by this pathogen and the main preventive measure is vaccination, but this is only possible for small groups of individuals. Therefore, it is important to investigate new oral vaccines to prevent IHNV. In this study, the CK6 chemokine protein of rainbow trout and the truncated G protein of IHNV were used to construct a secretory expression recombinant L.casei vaccine for rainbow trout. The results showed that the levels of IgM and IgT antibodies in rainbow trout reached the highest level on the 15th day after the secondary immunization, and the antibodies exhibited high inhibitory activity against viral infection. Furthermore, the expression of relevant cytokines in different tissues was detected and found to be significantly higher in the oral vaccine group than in the control group. It was also found that pPG-612-CK6-G/L.casei 393 could stimulate splenic lymphocyte proliferation and improve mucosal immunity with significant differences between the immunized and control groups. When infected with IHNV, the protection rate of pPG-612-CK6-G/L.casei 393 was 66.67% higher than that of the control group. We found that pPG-612-CK6-G/L.casei 393 expressed and secreted the rainbow trout chemokine CK6 protein and IHNV truncated G protein, retaining the original immunogenicity of rainbow trout while enhancing their survival rate. This indicates that recombinant L.casei provides a theoretical basis and rationale for the development of an oral vaccine against IHNV and has important practical implications for the protection of rainbow trout from IHNV infection.",

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic progressive intestinal inflammatory disease, characterized by an altered gut microbiota composition and accompanying alterations in circulatory bile acids. Increasing evidence supports the beneficial effect of probiotics intake on health. Introduction of probiotics to the intestines can modulate gut microbiota composition and in turn regulate the host immune system and modify the inflammatory response. Probiotics can also improve intestinal barrier function and exhibit a positive impact on host physiological and pathological conditions via gut microbiota-derived metabolites. Previous studies have demonstrated that Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) treatment could inhibit clinical manifestation of colitis in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mice, however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we employed the DSS-induced acute colitis mouse model to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of LcS and related mechanisms. Administration of LcS ameliorated the severity of DSS-induced colitis and enhanced intestinal integrity via induction of mucin-2 and occludin expression in colons. Fecal microbiota analysis showed that LcS increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacterial species in colitic mice, whereas the relative abundance of pathobionts was reduced. Additionally, LcS treatment modulated circulating bile acid profiles in colitic mice. In mice treated with LcS, we identified increased levels of primary taurine-conjugated bile acids, including taurocholic acid (TCA) and taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA). LcS treatment also increased the levels of secondary taurine-conjugated bile acids, including taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). Moreover, LcS treatment exhibited a suppressive effect on the hydroxylated primary bile acids α-muricholic acid (α-MCA) and β-muricholic acid (β-MCA). We further demonstrated that LcS treatment suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and nitric oxide (NO), and increased the expression of the anti-inflammatory mediator interleukin-10 (IL-10) in colon tissues, potentially as a result of altered bile acid profiles. Mechanistically, we showed that LcS treatment suppressed the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling via stabilization of inhibitor of NF-κB alpha (IκBα). Altogether, we have demonstrated the therapeutic effects of LcS in DSS-induced colitis, providing new insights into its effect on bile acid metabolism and the related anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Our findings provide support for the application of LcS in the treatment of IBD."

      "abstract": "The adverse effects of anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs in the intestines were related to alteration of the intestinal microbiota. However, there was less information about microbial metabolism on the adverse reactions. This study aimed to explore whether Lactobacillus casei could regulate gut microbiota or short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) disorders to protect intestinal adverse reactions induced by isoniazid (H) and rifampicin (R). Male Wistar rats were given low and high doses of Lactobacillus casei two hours before daily administration of anti-TB drugs. After 42 days, colon tissue and blood were collected for analysis. The feces at two-week and six-week were collected to analyze the microbial composition and the content of SCFAs in colon contents was determined. Supplementation of Lactobacillus casei increased the proportion of intestinal goblet cells induced by H and R (p < 0.05). In addition, HR also reduced the level of mucin-2 (p < 0.05), and supplementation of Lactobacillus casei restored. After two weeks of HR intervention, a decrease in OTUs, diversity index, the abundance of Bacteroides, Akkermansia, and Blautia, and an increase of the abundance of Lacetospiraceae NK4A136 group and Rumencoccus UCG-005, were observed compared with the control group (p all < 0.05). These indices in Lactobacillus casei intervention groups were similar to the HR group. Six-week intervention resulted in a dramatic reduction of Lacetospiraceae NK4A136 group, butyric acid, valeric acid and hexanoic acid, while an increase of Bacteroides and Blautia (p all < 0.05). Pretreatment with Lactobacillus casei significantly increased the content of hexanoic acid compared with HR group (p < 0.05). Lactobacillus casei might prevent intestinal injury induced by anti-tuberculosis drugs by regulating gut microbiota and SCFAs metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Microbial dysbiosis in dental plaque contributes to the occurrence of dental caries, to which Streptococcus mutans is a major contributor. Lactobacillus casei can be used as probiotic therapy to treat caries by replacing S. mutans within the dental plaque. However, the effects of probiotic treatment are not always stable. Oxyresveratrol (ORV), a plant-derived polyphenol, displays opposite effects in that it inhibits cariogenic and promotes commensal bacteria. Thus, the objectives of this study are to investigate the effects of ORV on bacterial proportions in S. mutans-L. casei biofilm and to elucidate how ORV weakens the competitiveness of S. mutans. Quantitative real-time PCR confirms a decreased S. mutans-L. casei ratio in dual-species biofilm by action of ORV. The culture supernatant of L. casei after being incubated with ORV (ORVLC) is prepared to explore the joint action of ORV and L. casei. ORVLC displays the strongest anti-biofilm effect against S. mutans when compared with the effects of L. casei supernatant or ORV alone. As a result of this treatment, both exopolysaccharides and bacteria contents in the biofilm are greatly reduced. The biofilm is transformed from water-insoluble glucan-dominant to water-soluble glucan-dominant by ORVLC through the modulation of the glycometabolism-related genes of S. mutans. As for the interactions between ORV and L. casei, ORV promotes L. casei to produce acetic acid, which provides L. casei with a competitive advantage against S. mutans. Taken together, ORV may be very suitable as an adjuvant medicine for probiotic therapy in the control of dental caries. IMPORTANCE The homeostatic imbalance in dental plaque associated with a sharp increase in the number of cariogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans is critical for the occurrence and development of caries. Probiotic therapy can restore ecological balance by replacing cariogenic pathogens with probiotics. The current study innovatively finds that oxyresveratrol, a natural polyphenol, can provide probiotic Lactobacillus casei with competitive dominance in its dual-species biofilm with S. mutans. The joint action of oxyresveratrol and L. casei strongly inhibits the biofilm formation of S. mutans. Additionally, oxyresveratrol promotes L. casei to produce acetic acid, which facilitates L. casei to compete with S. mutans. Through the effects of these two mechanisms, oxyresveratrol leads to a significantly decreased S. mutans-L. casei ratio in their dual-species biofilm. Thus, oxyresveratrol is speculated to be an ideal medicine for the prevention and treatment of caries by regulating oral flora balance.",

Observational studies have indicated that probiotics modulate inflammatory cytokines and metabolites; however, clinical evidence of the effect of probiotics on patients with tuberculosis is lacking. This study investigated the effects of Lactobacillus casei on inflammatory cytokines and metabolites during tuberculosis treatment. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial was conducted. A total of 47 inpatients were included and randomly assigned to receive standard antituberculosis therapy only (control group) or that treatment together with 1 × 1010 colony-forming units per day of Lactobacillus casei (low-dose group) or 2 × 1010 colony-forming units per day of Lactobacillus casei (high-dose group) for 4 weeks of intensive treatment during hospitalization. Plasma samples were analyzed for inflammatory cytokines and metabolomics with ELISA kits and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Daily Lactobacillus casei supplementation of up to 2 × 1010 colony-forming units significantly lowered the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and interleukin-12 (p=0.007, p=0.042, p=0.002, p<0.001, respectively) in patients with tuberculosis. Compared with the control and low-dose groups, the plasma metabolites of phosphatidylserine, maresin 1, phosphatidylcholine, L-saccharopine, and pyridoxamine were significantly upregulated, and N-acetylmethionine, L-tryptophan, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phenylalanine were downregulated in the high-dose group. Strong correlations were observed between metabolites and inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus casei supplementation during the intensive phase of tuberculosis treatment can significantly modulate inflammatory cytokines and metabolites. Decreased inflammatory cytokines may be related to metabolite changes.",

      "abstract": "Bifidobacteria are health-promoting human gut inhabitants, but accurate species-level composition of the gut bifidobacteria and their responses to probiotic intervention have not been fully explored. This was a follow-up work of our previous study, in which 104 volunteers from six different Asiatic regions (Singapore, Indonesia, Xinjiang, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Mongolia) were recruited. The gut microbiota and their responses towards Lactobacillus casei Zhang (LCZ) intervention were characterized (at days 0, 7, and 14; 14 days after stopping probiotic intake), and region-based differential responses were observed after LCZ intervention. This study further investigated changes in the species-level gut bifidobacteria by PacBio small-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT) using bifidobacteria-specific primers. Firstly, this study found that Bifidobacterium adolescentis (42.58%) and Bifidobacterium breve (26.34%) were the core species across the six Asiatic regions. Secondly, principal coordinate analysis of probiotic-induced changes in the gut bifidobacterial microbiota (represented by weighted UniFrac distances) grouped the six regions into two clusters, namely northern (Xinjiang, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, and Mongolia) and southern (Singapore, Indonesia) regions. Thirdly, LCZ intervention induced region-based differential responses of gut bifidobacterial microbiota. The relative abundance of Bifidobacterium animalis in subjects from northern but not southern region substantially increased after LCZ intervention. Moreover, LCZ intervention significantly increased the weighted UniFrac distances in the southern but not northern subjects 7 days after LCZ intervention. The gut B. adolescentis correlated significantly and negatively with the weighted UniFrac distances of the baseline gut bifidobacterial microbiota in subjects of northern but not southern region, suggesting a possible homeostatic effect of LCZ on the gut bifidobacterial population of northern but not southern subjects. Collectively, our study found that probiotic-induced responses of the gut bifidobacterial microbiota varied with subjects' geographic origins, and B. adolescentis might play a role in maintaining the overall stability of the gut bifidobacterial population. KEY POINTS: • The core species in the six Asiatic regions are Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium breve. • The gut bifidobacterial microbiota in people from various geographic origins showed different responses on probiotic administration.",

Direct experimental evidence clarifying the role of intestinal mucosa attributes in IgAN is lacking. In this study, a mouse model was established via multiple low-dose intraperitoneal injections of Lactobacillus casei cell wall extract (LCWE) emulsified with Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA). We found continuous and stable deposition of IgA in glomerular mesangial areas, accompanying high circulating levels of IgA and IgA-IgG complexes. Expression of the key extracellular matrix components collagen IV and fibronectin also increased in the mesangial areas of LCWE-induced mice. IgA+ B220+ B-cell proportion increased in the small intestine (SI), Peyer's patches, inguinal lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. The intestinal barrier was dysfunctional in the LCWE-induced mice, and consistent with this, higher levels of serum zonulin (namely prehaptoglobin-2), a regulator of epithelial and endothelial barrier function, were observed in patients with IgAN. Hematoxylin and eosin staining results indicated that immune tissues such as liver, spleen, and lymph nodes showed an inflammatory response and focal lesions. Glucocorticoid methylprednisolone treatment could alleviate serum IgA and IgA-IgG complex levels and mesangial IgA deposition. Taken together, our results indicate that we have successfully constructed a mouse model with IgA deposition in the mesangial areas of the glomeruli and provide evidence for the connection between the intestinal barrier and elevated circulating IgA and IgA-IgG in IgAN. © 2022 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.",

The aim of our study is to examine the efficacy of ampicillin and Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus treatment in cases of PPROM remote from term. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was carried out by examining the results of cases who were given Ampicillin and Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus treatment. The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 who didn't develop clinical chorioamnionitis and Group 2 who developed clinical chorioamnionitis. Obstetric characteristics, neonatal outcomes, adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 46 pregnant women, 40 in Group 1 and six in Group 2, were included in the study. The frequency of clinical chorioamnionitis developing during the treatment was found to be 13.0%. Mean gestational age at diagnosis was 28.43 ± 2.38 and 28.17 ± 1.33 for Groups 1 and Group 2, respectively. Mean gestational age at the time of delivery was 32.38 ± 2.07 31.33 ± 1.63 for Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. The mean latency period for Group 1 and Group 2 was 27.45 ± 1.71 days, 23.66 ± 4.53, respectively. Sepsis developed in six newborns (15%) in Group 1, while it developed in three newborns (50%) in Group 2. While 90% of the babies in Group 1 were discharged from the hospital, this rate was 66.7% in Group 2.

The present study investigated the potential QS-inhibitory activity of lyophilized postbiotics from Lactobacillus casei sub sp. casei PTCC 1608 on virulence phenotypes and biofilm of two strains and three clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The effect of L. casei postbiotics (LCP) at sub-minimum inhibitory concentration on the expression of QS genes including lasR/I, rhlR/I, pqsA, pqsR and virulence genes including pelF (pellicle/biofilm glycosyltransferase PelF), lasB (elastase LasB) and toxA (exotoxin A) was evaluated. The viability of mouse fibroblastic NIH/3T3 cell line treated with sub-MICS of LCP was also investigated. Postbiotics were characterized using mass spectrometry-based analyses. The QS-attenuation effect of pure lactic acid as the major constituent of LCP was determined on P. aeruginosa strains. Neutralized postbiotics and crude bacteriocin did not exhibit any antibacterial activity. It was found that sub-MICS of LCP could more drastically attenuate the tested virulence phenotypes and biofilm formation than lactic acid. Biofilm inhibition was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy. The rhlI, rhlR, and pelF genes were down-regulated after treatment with LCP. No cytotoxicity effect was observed on NIH/3T3 cell line. The findings demonstrated that postbiotics of L. casei could reduce the virulence and biofilm development of P. aeruginosa and suggested a novel safe natural source for the expansion of anti-virulence treatments.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of Lactobacillus casei in improving PPD and potential mechanisms. Four hours of daily maternal separation from postnatal day 2 to day 21 was performed to establish the PPD model in rats. From postnatal day 2 to day 28, rats were gavage-fed with an equal volume of normal saline, Lactobacillus casei (8 × 108 CFU/kg/day), or paroxetine (1.8 mg/kg/day), respectively. Rat behaviors were measured using the sucrose preference test, the elevated plus maze, the forced swim test, and the tail suspension test. Changes in gut microbiota were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. Administration of Lactobacillus casei improved depressive-like behaviors, intestinal microflora, and oxidative stress in PPD model rats. Western Blot or HPLC assays showed that Lactobacillus casei intervention reversed the changes of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor 1 (NR1), ERK1/2, and monoamines in the brain of PPD rats. These results suggest that Lactobacillus casei could improve PPD through altering gut microbiota composition, brain monoamines and oxidative stress, which may be associated with the regulation of the BDNF-ERK1/2 pathway.",

      "abstract": "Dietary intervention could modulate age-related neurological disorders via the gut-brain axis. The potential roles of a probiotic and the dietary fiber complex (DFC) on brain and gut function in aged mice were investigated in this study. Lactobacillus casei LTL1361 and DFC were orally administrated for 12 weeks, and the learning and memory ability, as well as the oxidative parameters, inflammatory markers, gut barrier function and microbial metabolite short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were investigated. LTL1361 and DFC supplementation ameliorated cognitive ability, attenuated oxidative stress in brain and inflammation in serum and colon, ameliorated gut barrier function, and increased the SCFA concentrations and gene expression of SCFA receptors. The protective effect was more significantly enhanced in aged mice treated with the combination of LTL1361 and DFC than treated with LTL1361 or DFC alone. These results could be associated with the protected morphology of pyramidal nerve cells in hippocampus of mice brain and the downregulation of apoptosis marker caspase-3 in brain and upregulation of tight junction proteins in small intestine and colon. The results indicated that Lactobacillus casei LTL1361 and DFC alleviated age-related cognitive impairment, as well as protected brain and gut function. Lactobacillus casei LTL1361 and DFC might be used as novel and promising antiaging agents in human.",

This study investigated the alterations of gut microbiota and proteome in AFB1-exposed rats treated with probiotic Lactobacillus casei Shirota (Lcs). Forty male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 8) comprised control, AFB1, AFB1+activated charcoal, AFB1+Lcs, and Lcs groups. The rats were subjected to different treatments via oral gavage for four weeks. Urine and serum were collected for the measurement of AFB1 biomarkers and organs were harvested for histological analysis. Metagenomic sequencing was performed on fecal samples to profile gut microbiota. Besides, AFB1 most affected organ i.e. jejunum was subjected to proteomic analysis. The results indicated that Lcs intervention significantly reduced AFB1 biomarkers. H&E-stained intestine showed Lcs alleviated AFB1-induced inflammation and abnormal cell growth, particularly at the jejunum. Although AFB1 increased potentially pathogenic bacteria and reduced beneficial bacteria abundance in feces, the microbiota composition was normalized with Lcs treatment. The gut proteome analysis of the jejunum sample showed several pathways of AFB1 toxicity, wherein Lcs treatment demonstrated its protective effect. It is concluded that metagenomic and proteomic approaches are useful tools to understand AFB1-Lcs interaction and detoxification mechanism in the gut.",

Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) impairment has been proposed as a mechanism of fat accumulation and glucose tolerance. Our aims were to determine the role of intestinal epithelial glut1 activity in obesity and the mechanism of anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus casei Zhang (LCZ) intervention in the absence of gut villi-specific glut1 expression. METHODS: This study compared the body weight, intestinal microbiota perturbations, fat mass accumulation, and glucose tolerance (by oral glucose tolerance test) between high-fat diet fed villi-specific glut1 knockout (KO) mice and control mice (glut1 flox/flox) with/without LCZ intervention. The intestinal microbiota was evaluated by metagenomic sequencing. RESULTS: Our results showed that villi-specific glut1 KO mice had more fat deposition at the premetaphase stage, impaired glucose tolerance, and obvious alterations in gut microbiota compared to control mice. Probiotic administration significantly lowered the body weight, the weights of mesenteric and perirenal white adipose tissues (WAT), and mediated gut microbiota modulation in both types of KO and control mice. The species Barnesiella intestinihominis and Faecalibaculum rodentium might contribute to fasting fat mass accumulation associated with gut-specific glut1 inactivation, while the probiotic-mediated anti-obesity effect was linked to members of the Bacteroides genera, Odoribacter genera and Alistipes finegoldii. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that abrogating gut epithelial GLUT1 activity affected the gut microbiota, fat mass accumulation, and glucose tolerance; and LCZ administration reduced fat mass accumulation and central obesity.",

Volunteers were randomly divided into equal probiotic and placebo groups and changes in blood biochemical indicators, oxidative and inflammatory markers, and gut microbiota were examined after three weeks of probiotic intervention. The probiotic group's antioxidant levels were significantly enhanced post-intervention. Total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) levels were significantly increased (p < 0.0001), while malondialdehyde (MDA) levels decreased (p < 0.05), and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) levels increased, but with no significant difference. In addition, Interleukin-10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated (p < 0.05, respectively). Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, and Bacteroides expression was significantly reduced (p < 0.05), while Clostridium leptum, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus expression increased (p < 0.05). Volunteer health status was quantified using principal components and cluster analysis, indicating that the probiotic group's overall score was higher than that of the placebo group.

Yet, the mechanism behind such beneficial effects remains unclear. This study constructed a rat model of antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis to monitor the effects and mechanism of probiotic (Lactobacillus casei Zhang) treatment in maintaining gut homeostasis and restoring the gut microbiota/metabolome. Forty rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 10 per group): control receiving only saline (Ctrl), antibiotic (AB-Ctrl), antibiotic followed by probiotic (AB-Prob), and antibiotic plus probiotic followed by probiotic (AB + Prob). Rat fecal microbiota and sera were collected at four time points from pre-treatment to post-treatment. The probiotic-treated group (AB + Prob) had significantly more Parabacteroides (P.) goldsteinii after one week of antibiotic and probiotic intervention but fewer antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs)-possessing bacteria (Clostridioides difficile and Burkholderiales bacterium). Consistently, metabolomics data revealed that both probiotic groups had more acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and valeric acid post treatment. Moreover, a potential probiotic species, P. goldsteinii, strongly correlated with L. casei, as well as propionic acid, butyric acid, and valeric acid. Furthermore, administering probiotic lowered the serum IL-1α level. In contrast, the antibiotic-recipients had a higher irreversible level of IL-1α, suggesting inflammation of the rats. Thus, antibiotic treatment not only led to host gut dysbiosis, but inflammatory responses and an increase in gut ARGs. Daily L. casei Zhang supplementation could alleviate the side effect of cefdinir intervention and facilitate the restoration of gut microbial homeostasis, and these probiotic effects might involve P. goldsteinii-mediated beneficial activities."

The results showed that MRPs exhibited enhanced antioxidative activities compared with their physically mixed counterparts. The digested MRPs displayed excellent resistance to pathogenic bacteria and promoted the growth of L. casei. Moreover, MRP-encapsulated L. casei showed a higher survival rate than free L. casei under tested adverse conditions including heat treatment, storage, and mechanical forces. Under simulated digestion conditions, the viability of L. casei decreased from 8.8 log cfu/mL to 1.6 log cfu/mL, while that of MRP-encapsulated L. casei was maintained at 7.4 log cfu/mL. Thus, MRP-based SPI-oligosaccharide conjugates exhibited great potential for microencapsulation of probiotics.",

Probiotics are increasingly being recognized as a means of treatment for people suffering from IBD. Our previous studies demonstrated that Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 (L. casei ATCC 393) effectively alleviated enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli K88-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction. This study was conducted to investigate the protective effects of L. casei ATCC 393 and its metabolites on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC in C57BL/6 mice and the potential mechanism of these effects. The results showed that oral administration of L. casei ATCC 393 and its metabolites both effectively reversed the DSS-induced weight loss, and the reduction in the disease activity index (DAI), colon length, and villus height of colon tissue in mice. Compared to the DSS-induced model group, L. casei ATCC 393 and its metabolites significantly inhibited the infiltration of immune cells into the intestinal mucosa, decreased the production of pro-inflammatory factors, and increased the expression of anti-inflammatory factors in the serum and colon tissue, increased the expression levels of occludin, ZO-1, and claudin-1, and reduced the expression of nucleotide binding oligomeric domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), cysteine proteinase-1 (Caspase-1), IL-1β, and IL-18. In addition, L. casei ATCC 393 and its metabolites effectively improved DSS-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis. These results suggested that L. casei ATCC 393 and its metabolites alleviated the DSS-induced ulcerative inflammatory response in C57BL/6 mice through the NLRP3-(Caspase-1)/IL-1β signaling pathway.",

In the present study, we investigated the effect of Lactobacillus casei on liver injury in rats co-exposed to alcohol and iron and evaluated its possible mechanism. Sixty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups for 12 weeks: the Control group (administered normal saline by gavage and provided a normal diet); alcohol +iron group (Model group, treated with alcohol [3.5-5.3 g/kg/day] by gavage and dietary iron [1,500 mg/kg]); Model group supplemented with L. casei (8 × 108 CFU kg-1 day-1) (L. casei group). Using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and transmission electron microscopy, we observed that L. casei supplementation could alleviate disorders associated with lipid metabolism, inflammation, and intestinal mucosal barrier injury. Moreover, levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, triglyceride (TG), and hepatic TG were significantly increased in the model group; however, these levels were significantly decreased following the 12-week L. casei supplementation. In addition, we observed notable improvements in intestinal mucosal barrier function and alterations in T lymphocyte subsets and natural killer cells in L. casei-treated rats when compared with the model group. Furthermore, L. casei intervention alleviated serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, accompanied by decreased serum endotoxin levels and downregulated expression of toll-like receptor 4 and its related molecules MyD88, nuclear factor kappa-B p65, and TNF-α. Accordingly, supplementation with L. casei could effectively improve liver injury induced by the synergistic interaction between alcohol and iron. The underlying mechanism for this improvement may be related to immune regulation and inhibition of enterogenic endotoxin-mediated inflammation."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), the second leading cause of genital infection in women of reproductive age, is caused by yeasts of the genus Candida. Treatment is usually empirical and performed with azoles, which have shown increasing ineffectiveness due to resistance from these species. This therapeutic challenge has led to the search for new treatment strategies. Lactobacillus spp. produce several components with microbicidal effects, such as lactic acid. These species are the main components of a healthy vaginal microbiota and have been used as probiotics. The aim of this work was to investigate the in vitro inhibitory effects of Lactobacillus casei Shirota on both the Candida spp. that cause VVC and on C. auris. METHODS: The microbicidal effects of L. casei Shirota on the main VVC-causing species, C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. norvegensis and C. parapsilosis, in addition to C. auris were investigated by counting the Colony-forming Units (CFUs) after cocultivation. The antifungal activity of lactic acid against these Candida strains was assessed using the microtiter broth dilution method to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The effects of L. casei Shirota on hyphal and early biofilm formation was measured by optical microscopy. RESULTS: L. casei Shirota showed inhibitory action against all tested Candida spp., ranging from 66.9 to 95.6% inhibition depending on the species. This inhibition is possibly related to the production of lactic acid, since lactic acid has shown microbicidal action against these same Candida spp. at a concentration of 5 mg/mL, which corresponds to half of the normal physiological concentration. In addition, L. casei Shirota was able to reduce the formation of C. albicans hyphae and early biofilms, showing strong anti-Candida effects. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that L. casei Shirota has antifungal activity against the Candida species that cause VVC. L. casei also has microbicidal action against C. auris.",

METHODS: A multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (the ECLISP) trial, was conducted in three tertiary spinal cord injury centre in the UK to assess the efficacy of consuming a probiotic beverage containing at least 6.5 × 109 live Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS) in preventing AAD and CDI and in patients with SCI and to determine whether proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and under nutrition-risk are risk factors for AAD/CDI. LcS or placebo was given once daily for the duration of an antibiotic course and continued for 7 days thereafter. Follow up was set at 7 and 30 days after the antibiotic course finished. The primary outcome was occurrence of AAD up to 30 days after finishing LcS/placebo. This trial is completed and registered (ISRCTN:13119162). FINDINGS: Between November 2014, and November 2019, 359 consenting adult SCI patients (median age: 53.3; range: 18-88 years), from 3 SCI centres responsible for providing approximate 45-50% of UK SCI service, with a requirement for antibiotics due to infection were randomly allocated to receive LcS (n = 181) or placebo (n = 178). Overall, no statistical difference was seen in occurrence of the primary outcomes of AAD at 30 days follow up (45% v 42.1%, RR: 1.071, 0.8-1.4, p = 0.639). In the secondary analyses LcS was associated with a lower risk of AAD at 7 (19% v 35.7%, RR: 0.53, 0.29-0.99, p = 0.040) and 30 days follow up (28% v 52.2%, RR: 0.54, 0.32-0.91, p = 0.015) in the participants who took PPI regularly. Under nutrition-risk was associated with an increased risk of AAD at 7 (RR: 1.76, 1.28-2.44) and 30 days follow up (RR: 1.69, 1.30-2.0). No intervention-related adverse events were reported during the study. INTERPRETATION: The present study indicates that LcS could not prevent AAD/CDI in unselected SCI patients. LcS might have the potential to prevent AAD in the higher risk group of patients on regular PPI. Confirmatory studies are needed to allow translation of this apparent therapeutic success into improved clinical outcomes. FUNDING: Yakult Honsha Co., Ltd."

      "abstract": "A total of 130 isolates were screened, twelve isolates were characterized for probiotic attributes and two isolates with best probiotic features were evaluated in the study. Isolates MYSRD108 and MYSRD71 survived gastric conditions and were susceptible to tested antibiotics. Isolates showed more vital cell surface traits such as autoaggregation of 89.2 and 88.5% and cell surface hydrophobicity of 61 and 64%. PCR amplification followed by 16sRNA sequencing results confirmed that the isolates as Lactobacillus casei (MYSRD 108) and Lactobacillus plantarum (MYSRD 71). During this study, the Cells and their Cell Free Supernatant (CFS) were examined for antimicrobial activity. Both the isolates inhibited different bacterial pathogens in which the growth of S. paratyphi was significantly reduced. Further, their CFS also showed inhibitory effects against S. paratyphi with agar well diffusion and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration using Broth micro dilution method. The antimicrobial compounds in the CFS was characterized to different constraints such as pH neutralization, heat treatment, Hydrogen peroxide test and storage stability at -20> °C and represented that the antagonistic acitivity against Salmonella is due to the presence of organic acids in the supernatants that lowered the pH. These strains were further examined for the inhibition of S. paratyphi biofilm. The results indicated that CFS reduced S. paratyphi biofilm by more than 75% and the number of Salmonella biofilm was effectively reduced using 15% concentration of CFS. These strains may be used to produce antimicrobial compounds which can be a substitute for chemical preservatives in food industry."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of probiotic Lactobacillus casei DN 114001 (LC) on DSS-induced experimental IBD. RESULTS: Eighteen female pigs (Sus scrofa f. domestica, weight 33-36 kg, age 4-5 months) were divided into 3 groups (6 animals per group): controls with no treatment, DSS, and DSS + LC. LC was administered to overnight fasting animals in a dietary bolus in the morning on days 1-7 (4.5 × 1010 live bacteria/day). DSS was applied simultaneously on days 3-7 (0.25 g/kg/day). On day 8, the pigs were sacrificed. Histopathological score and length of crypts/glands (stomach, jejunum, ileum, transverse colon), length and width of villi (jejunum, ileum), and mitotic and apoptotic indices (jejunum, ileum, transverse colon) were assessed. DSS increased the length of glands in the stomach, length of crypts and villi in the jejunum and ileum, and the histopathological score of gastrointestinal damage, length of crypts and mitotic activity in the transverse colon. Other changes did not achieve any statistical significance. Administration of LC reduced the length of villi in the jejunum and ileum to control levels and decreased the length of crypts in the jejunum. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with a probiotic strain of LC significantly accelerated regeneration of the small intestine in a DSS-induced experimental porcine model of IBD.",

We aimed to evaluate the effect of cell-free Lactobacillus casei 21L10 supernatant (LC) on the cell line HT-29 challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in order to modulate production of NO, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Cell line HT-29 was stimulated with LPS in the presence or absence of LC. Our results showed that LC from L. casei 21L10 did not affect the viability of unstimulated HT-29 cells line. HT-29 cell line treatment with LC caused significant decrease of LPS induced NO production after 3 h, and 24 h, but not after 48 h. Proliferation activity of LPS stimulated HT-29 cell line analysed with MTT assay significantly decreased after 24 h and 48 h, but not after 3 h. The majority of LPS stimulated HT-29 cell line treated with LC showed annexin V/PI positivity at 48 h survival, which corresponded to late apoptotic/necrotic cell features. The observed differences suggest that cell-free L. casei 21L10 supernatant could participate in attenuation of LPS-induced inflammation, and may exhibit anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic/necrotic effects. This study provides pilot data for the further development of L. casei exoproducts as an anti-inflammatory or anti-proliferative agent for the treatment of inflammatory and cancer diseases in gut. However, more data is needed before final conclusions of L. casei cell-free supernatant's efficacy can be drawn.",

The aim of our study was to assess efficacy and safety of LGG treatment in children with BA after HPE with special focus on bacterial cholangitis (BCH) and quantitative assessment of the gut microbiota composition and metabolism. METHODS: We performed double-blind placebo controlled trial with patients randomized into treatment group who received LGG (n = 14) and placebo (n = 16). The gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were assessed at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. Clinical and laboratory parameters including episodes of bacterial cholangitis (BCH) were collected during the study period and after 2-year follow-up. Additionally, stool composition of BA patients was compared with healthy age-matched control group. RESULTS: There were lower concentration of SCFA in children with BA compared to control group and significant increase in the number of Enterococcus bacteria. After 6 months of treatment, neither laboratory parameters nor gut microbiota composition differed between LGG group and placebo. PP analysis results were similar to ITT analysis, no significant differences between study and control group. Overall, there were 11 (36%) patients who developed at least one episode of bacterial cholangitis; 3 (21%) in the LGG group compared to 8 (50%) placebo group (p = 0.14). Bacterial cultures were positive in 22% of cases and recurrence after the first episode was observed in 27% of patients. The level of total bilirubin decreased below 2 mg/dl after 6 months of the study in 6 (42.8%) patients in the LGG group and in 8 (50%) patients in the placebo group (p = 0.73). During 2-year follow-up 6 out of 14 patients (42.8%) in the LGG group and 11 out of 16 placebo patients (68.7%) underwent liver transplantation (p = 0.27). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BA present with specific microbiota profiles and decreased SCFA what gives opportunities to implement novel therapeutic options based on modulation of  microbiota. Whether LGG is an effective therapy needs to be studied in a larger group with similar outcome parameters.",

Here, the anti-diabetic effects and underlying mechanisms of Lactobacillus casei LC89 are investigated in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice, which was induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) with streptozotocin (100 mg per kg BW). The results show that LC89 at a dose of 109 CFU day-1 decreases fasting blood glucose (FBG) and insulin levels by 35.12% and 28.37%, respectively, compared to the diabetes control (DC) group. Moreover, LC89 treatment improved the insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), serum lipid profiles and inflammation cytokines. The real-time polymerase chain reaction indicated that LC89 markedly downregulates the mRNA expression of hepatic glucagon (GCG), glucagon receptor (GCGR), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). Meanwhile, LC89 significantly decreases the abundance of Odoribacter, but increases the Alloprevotella, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides and Ruminococcus content. Therefore, LC89 plays a positive role in alleviating T2DM by regulating gut microbiota and glucagon signal pathway-related genes, and it may be a beneficial dietary supplement to regulate glucose metabolism in T2DM.",

The present study generated recombinant surface-displayed Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) expressing the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) of NDV (Lc-pPG-HN) and a live pPG vector (Lc-pPG) and evaluated their immunogenicity. A 1670 bp HN gene fragment was successfully amplified and cloned into a prokaryotic protein expression system. Protein expression in the resulting recombinant Lc-pPG-HN (surface displayed) strain was verified using Western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence. A single band was observed on the Western blots, and the molecular weight of the corresponding protein was 63 kDa. A fluorescent signal for Lc-pPG-HN was observed using fluorescence microscopy. A total of 270 healthy chicks were divided into three treatment groups. Five replicates were used for each treatment, while six chicks were used per replicate. The following three treatment groups were used: physiological saline group (Control), Lc-pPG group and recombinant vaccine group (Lc-pPG-HN). The primary immunization and booster immunization of the chicks were performed via oral administration on 1 and 10 days old. Tissue and blood samples were collected from chickens that received oral recombinant L. casei strains on 1, 7, 14 and 21 days post-immunization for immune-related index analyses. Chickens orally immunized with Lc-pPG-HN showed significantly increased body weights and immune organ indices. Oral immunization with Lc-pPG-HN also enhanced the concentrations of serum interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), intestinal lavage fluid secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) and histomorphological development of the small intestine. Our results also indicated that recombinant L. casei significantly increased Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium colonization and decreased the relative abundance of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the chicken caecum. Similar enhancement effects from hemagglutination inhibition were also observed in the antibody titers. Oral administration of Lc-pPG-HN effectively protected against NDV and alleviated the symptoms of the NDV challenge. In summary, recombinant L. casei had positive impacts on the performance, immunological function, gut development, and microbiota of growing chicks and may be a potential therapeutic candidate against NDV.",

The amounts of phenolic and flavonoid compounds in TPE were 890.04 mg/g gallic acid and 512.76 mg/g extract (respectively), and it had high antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Then, the extract was encapsulated by maltodextrin-whey protein concentrate. The results related to the particle size, zeta-potential, and microencapsulation efficiency of the TPE microencapsulation were 93.87 nm, 18.99 MV, and 64.35% respectively. In order to investigate the effect of nano- and free TPE on the properties of yogurt during a 15-day storage period of 5 treatments including control, nano- and free TPE at 750 and 1,000 ppm were provided and the physicochemical properties, probiotic bacteria viability, and sensory properties were investigated. The results showed that adding TPE to yogurt affects the physicochemical properties, probiotic bacterial viability, and sensory properties were investigated. The results showed that adding TPE to yogurt affects the physicochemical properties. TPE samples had lower pH, less syneresis, and more acidity, viscosity, and antioxidant properties compared to the control sample (p < .05). Furthermore, in these samples, the viability of probiotic bacteria during storage was higher than the control treatment and the sensory properties were acceptable. In most cases, better results were observed in nano-TPE treatment. Therefore, by industrial production of probiotic yogurt containing nano-TPE as a functional food, a new choice will be provided for consumers of dairy products that would have more desirable nutritional value and sensory properties."

Some studies have shown that some bacterium of Lactobacillus stimulate the production of antimicrobial peptides in intestinal cells to clear enteric pathogens, however, which antimicrobial peptides are produced by L. casei stimulation and its function are still not completely understood. In this study, we investigated the changes of antimicrobial peptides' expression after intragastric administration of L. casei to mice. The bioinformatics analysis revealed there were nine genes strongly associated with up-regulated DEGs. But, of these, only the antimicrobial peptide mReg3a gene was continuously up-regulated, which was also confirmed by qRT-PCR. We found out the mReg3a expressed in engineering E.coli promoted cell proliferation and wound healing proved by CCK-8 assay and wound healing assay. Moreover, the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and E-cadherin in mReg3a treatment group were significantly higher than that in the control group under the final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml both in Porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) and Mouse intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) (p < 0.05). Surprisingly, the recombinant mReg3a not only inhibited Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), but also reduced the copy number of the piglet diarrheal viruses, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine rotavirus (PoRV), indicating the antimicrobial peptides mReg3a may be feed additives to resist the potential of the intestinal bacterial and viral diarrhea disease."

Probiotics become a promising manipulator to prevent or attenuate the progression of arthritis, some evidences suggesting that lactobacilli treatment influence the responses to RA therapy but the underlying mechanisms are limited. By using a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats, the study assessed the effects of two L. casei strains (CCFM1074, CCFM1075) on the immune responses, gut microbiota and plasma metabolites via an integrated cross-omics approach including fecal 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing and plasma metabolomics. The genome of the two strains was analyzed and compared using whole-genome sequencing approach to further confirm biology functions. CCFM1074 reduced arthritic symptoms while CCFM1075 did not, though both strains down-regulated the plasma IL-6 and Th17 cells proportion. CCFM1074 enhanced the proportion of Treg cells in mesenteric lymph nodes which was significantly associated with SCFAs upregulation, as well as with genomic evidence that CCFM1074 possesses more functional genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Moreover, CCFM1074 regulated the gut microbiota, including modulating community structure, decreasing the abundance of Alistipes and Parabacteroides and increasing the abundance of Oscillibacter. The differential metabolites modulated by CCFM1074 including eicosapentaenoic acid and docosapentaenoic acid which involved in unsaturated fatty acids metabolism. Furthermore, alterations of gut microbial community were correlated with the plasma metabolome. In summary, L. casei CCFM1074 alleviated arthritis via rebalancing gut microbiota, immune responses and plasma metabolites.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the anti-inflammatory effect of Lactobacillus casei 3260 (LC) alone and LC-fermented Gleditsia sinensis thorn (GST) extract in mouse model of type II collagen induced rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In our previous work, we confirmed the anti-inflammatory effects of LC and GST against LPS-induced inflammation in vitro. In this study, LC and GST were fermented and their effects were assessed in an animal model of RA. Both LC and fermented GST (fGST) treatment reduced mice serum nitrite and total cholesterol and triggered myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. In addition, both LC and fGST reduced inflammation-related serum biomarkers such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, and IL-1β. As per the morphological analysis, both LC and fGST protected hind paw joints against RA, and its related mRNA markers improved. Finally, arthritis scores were measured as an indicator of RA of the whole experimental period; the scores suggested that both LC and fGST protect against collagen-induced RA-related inflammation in a mouse model."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Burns are the most common type of trauma with a high mortality rate worldwide. The use of modern and natural medicines, especially probiotic products, has been recently considered for cutaneous wound healing. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of Lactobacillus casei on wound healing caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the anti-adhesion activity of L. casei was examined by the glass slide method, and inhibitory substances in the cell-free supernatant (CFS) were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Following the induction of second-degree wounds, multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa was injected subcutaneously and directly on the burn. The animals were divided into four groups. The supernatant of L. casei was sprayed for treatment every day and wound healing was examined. RESULTS: Based on our findings, the supernatant of L. casei showed considerable anti-adhesion effects on P. aeruginosa. HPLC analysis indicated that the inhibitory effect of this supernatant can be due to four main organic acids including lactic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, and succinic acid. The effect of treatment on fibroblastic cells showed that the treated group by supernatant of L. casei had more fibroblastic cells compared with the non-treated group. Moreover, this supernatant increased the rate of fibroblastic cells, re-epithelialization in the wound area, and the largest thickness of the epidermis and dermis layers. CONCLUSION: The present findings showed that L. casei supernatant significantly reduced inflammation and could be used to treat P. aeruginosa infection in second-degree burns."

The purpose of this multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of a probiotic preparation comprising Lactobacillus rhamnosus ŁOCK 0900, Lactobacillus rhamnosus ŁOCK 0908, and Lactobacillus casei ŁOCK 0918 in children under 2 years of age with AD and a cow's milk protein (CMP) allergy. The study enrolled 151 children, who-apart from being treated with a CMP elimination diet-were randomized to receive the probiotic preparation at a daily dose of 109 bacteria or a placebo for three months, with a subsequent nine-month follow-up. The primary outcomes included changes in AD symptom severity assessed with the scoring AD (SCORAD) index and in the proportion of children with symptom improvement (a SCORAD score decreased by at least 30% in comparison with that at baseline). After the three-month intervention, both the probiotic and placebo groups showed a significant (p < 0.0001) decrease in SCORAD scores, which was maintained nine months later. The percentage of children who showed improvement was significantly higher in the probiotic than in the placebo group (odds ratio (OR) 2.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-5.8; p = 0.012) after three months. Probiotics induced SCORAD improvement mainly in allergen sensitized patients (OR 6.03; 95% CI 1.85-19.67, p = 0.001), but this positive effect was not observed after nine months. The results showed that the mixture of probiotic ŁOCK strains offers benefits for children with AD and CMP allergy. Further research is necessary to assess the effect of probiotic supplementation on the development of immune tolerance (NCT04738565).",

The objective is to investigate the effect of adjunctive Lactobacillus casei on tuberculosis-drug-induced liver injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: A post hoc analysis is conducted for a previous randomized controlled trial. The trial is registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (No. ChiCTR-IOR-17013210). Four hundred twenty nine patients are allocated to receive standard tuberculosis therapy alone (control group), or together with 1 × 1010 colony-forming units (CFU) per day (low-dose group), or 2 × 1010 CFU per day of L. casei (high-dose group) during tuberculosis treatment. The L. casei supplementation significantly reduced the incidence of the abnormal increase of cholestasis-related liver indices including alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.024) and bilirubin (p = 0.013). Plasma lipopolysaccharide (p = 0.02), intestinal permeability biomarkers including zonula occludens-1 (p = 0.001) and intestinal fatty acid binding protein (p = 0.002) are significantly reduced. The gut microbiota composition is dramatically altered with a reduction of Bacteroidetes (p < 0.001) and a corresponding increase of Actinobacteria (p < 0.001) and Firmicutes (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: L. casei supplementation is beneficial for suppressing abnormally elevated cholestasis-related liver indices during tuberculosis treatment, which may be related to its modification on blood lipopolysaccharide, intestinal barrier function, and gut microbiota.",

At first, the antioxidant properties and degree of hydrolysis (DH) of GPH were determined using the microbial protease enzymes (alcalase and flavourzyme), the results showed that alcalase enzyme can produce GPH with higher DH and antioxidant properties (p < .05). Also, increasing the hydrolysis time had a positive effect on these properties (p < .05). The DH, free radical scavenging DPPH, and ferric reducing power for GPH by alcalase at 30 min was 21.51%, 88.68%, and 0.33 μmol ferrous/ g, respectively. Therefore, this treatment was used for further experiments. In the next part, the mentioned GPH was added to the stirred yogurt with three concentrations (0.5, 1.5, and 1.5%) and physicochemical properties and viability of Lactobacillus casei and sensory properties were measured during 15 days of storage. The results showed that the GPH treatment had higher pH, viscosity, and texture firmness and less acidity and syneresis compared with the control sample (p < .05). Also, in these samples, the decreasing trend of L. casei viability was slower than the control treatment during the storage period (p < .05). In most parameters, better results were observed with increasing the concentration GPH and all the treatments were acceptable in terms of sensory properties. Therefore, by producing yogurt containing GPH, a new functional food can be provided for consumers of dairy products, which in addition to the desired taste, good nutritional properties can be also achieved from its consumption."

      "abstract": "Bacterial vaginosis (BV) and its recurrence are most commonly associated with the formation of Gardnerella species biofilm. Probiotics are typically used to treat BV; however, the optimal period of Lactobacillus probiotic application in BV treatment remains uncertain. The present study aimed to explore the effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus casei on various stages of biofilm formation in Gardnerella species. The biofilm-forming ability of seven strains, including one Gardnerella vaginalis ATCC 14018 and six clinically isolated Gardnerella species, was determined via gentian violet staining assay. Moreover, the sensitivity of the planktonic and biofilm forms toward metronidazole and clindamycin was assessed via microdilution broth method. L. rhamnosus Xbb-LR-1 and L. casei Xbb-LC-1 were added during various stages of biofilm formation in Gardnerella species and were cocultured for 24 h. The biofilm thickness of each sample was determined via confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The absolute quantities of Gardnerella species in each sample was obtained via real time polymerase chain reaction method, and the pH value was obtained using a pH indicator paper. Biofilm formation by Gardnerella species in a medium with distinct pH values was observed via gentian violet staining, CLSM, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The biofilm increased the resistance of Gardnerella species toward metronidazole and clindamycin. L. rhamnosus added at the initial biofilm formation stage in Gardnerella species exhibited highest inhibitory effect, with a percentage inhibition of 38.17% ± 1.35%. When the pH value of the culture medium was <4.5 or >6.5, ATCC 14018 could hardly form a biofilm; however, at pH ≥4.5 and ≤6.5, it was able to form a stronger biofilm. The amount of biofilm attained maximum value at optical density of 3.29 ± 0.28 (595 nm), pH 5.5, and at 36 h. Biofilm formation increases the resistance of Gardnerella species toward antibiotics. Maintaining an acidic vaginal environment with pH <4.5 and a vaginal microbiota dominated by Lactobacillus remarkably prevents the formation of Gardnerella species biofilm at the initial stage, which further has a significant impact on the treatment and prevention of biofilm-related infections.",

So we aimed to determine the proteome of Lactobacillus casei ATCC39392 strain in response to different pHs of 5 and 7 using proteomic analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Supernatant and bacterial extraction of Lactobacillus casei ATCC39392 adapts at pHs 5 and 7 were isolated using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The comparison of results showed that 7 protein spots were seen in pH 5 but not in pH 7. Afterward, they were excised and sent for Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to be identified. RESULTS: Seven different proteins (four secretory and three structural) with different roles in human body health were identified. Prescribed proteins include putative cell wall associated Hydrolase, Glycoside Hydrolase, beta-N-Acetyl hexosaminidase, Histidine Kinase, Chaperonin, metal dependent Hydrolase and Lysozyme. CONCLUSION: Seven isolated proteins with anti-cancer and digestive impresses are proper subjects in therapy or drug delivery approaches especially oral drug usage for protection against stomach acidic area."

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of heat-killed Lactobacillus casei DKGF7 on the symptomatic improvement of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in a rat disease model and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the beneficial effects of heat-killed probiotics. Seven male Wistar rats were induced with IBS by restraint stress and administered heat-killed L. casei DKGF7 for four weeks and then compared with seven rats in the control group. Stool consistency measured four weeks after initial treatment was the primary outcome measure. To investigate the mechanism of action of the heat-killed bacteria on IBS, we measured serum corticosterone levels, inflammatory cytokines in colon tissue, and expression of tight junction proteins (TJPs) in the epithelium. The treatment group showed significantly better stool consistency scores than the control group at week 4, as well as at every measured time point (all p values < 0.05). The treatment group showed lower serum corticosterone levels, lower colonic inflammatory cytokine levels, and higher expression of TJPs compared with the control group. Paraprobiotics such as heat-killed L. casei DKGF7 can improve stool consistency in a rat IBS model, which may indicate a potential therapeutic strategy for IBS treatment.",

Adhesion to intestinal tissue is the first step of pathogen infection. This work was to investigate the protective function of surface layer protein (SLP) from Lactobacillus casei fb05 against the harmful effects of E. coli and Salmonella on intestinal tissue (collagen and HT-29 cells). The SLP of L. casei fb05 was identified by transmission electron microscopy and SDS-PAGE. The purified SLP could reduce the adhesion of E. coli and Salmonella to collagen and HT-29 cells as observed by light microscope. The flow cytometry results showed that the L. casei fb05 SLP decreased the two pathogens-induced apoptosis of HT-29 cells by about 45%-49%. In addition, the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 caused by the two pathogens was significantly declined by the interference of the L. casei fb05 SLP. All the findings demonstrated that the L. casei fb05 SLP could decrease the deleterious effects of E. coli and Salmonella on intestinal tract in two ways: reducing pathogen adhesion and inhibiting pathogen-induced apoptosis. The potential of L. casei fb05 SLP in the treatment of intestinal diseases might be explored in this work.",

The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in liver diseases. This study aimed to explore the effects of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS), a probiotics used widely around the world, on acute liver injury (ALI), as well as the underlying mechanism. Sprague Dawley rats were intragastrically administered LcS suspensions or placebo once daily for 7 days before induction of ALI by intraperitoneal injection of D-galactosamine (D-GalN). Histopathological examination and assessments of liver biochemical markers, inflammatory cytokines, and the gut microbiota, metabolome and transcriptome were conducted. Our results showed that pretreatment with LcS reduced hepatic and intestinal damage and reduced the elevation of serum gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), total bile acids, IL-5, IL-10, G-CSF and RANTES. The analysis of the gut microbiota, metabolome and transcriptome showed that LcS lowered the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes; reduced the enrichment of metabolites such as chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, d-talose and N-acetyl-glucosamine, reduce the depletion of d-glucose and l-methionine; and alleviated the downregulation of retinol metabolism and PPAR signalling and the upregulation of the pyruvate metabolism pathway in the liver.

METHODS: Patients with CBP attending a single Urological Institution were enrolled in this phase IV study. At enrollment, all patients were treated with antibiotics in agreement with EAU guidelines and then were treated with L. casei DG® (2 capsules/day for 3 months). Clinical and microbiological analyses were carried out before (enrollment, T0) and 6 months (T2) after the treatment. Both safety and adherence to the treatment were evaluated 3 months (T1) after the enrollment. NIH Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (CPSI), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Quality of Well-Being (QoL) questionnaires were used. The outcome measures were the rate of symptomatic recurrence, changes in questionnaire symptom scores and the reduction of antibiotic use. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients were included. At T2, 61 patients (72.6%) reported a clinical improvement of symptoms with a return to their clinical status before symptoms. A time dependent improvement in clinical symptoms with significant changes in NIH-CPSI, IPSS and QoL (mean difference T2 vs T0: 16.5 ± 3.58; - 11.0 ± 4.32; + 0.3 ± 0.09; p < 0.001), was reported. We recorded that L. casei DG® treatment induced a statistically significant decrease in both (p < 0.001) symptomatic recurrence [1.9/3 months vs 0.5/3 months] and antibiotic use [- 7938 UDD]. No clinically relevant adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: L. casei DG® prevents symptomatic recurrences and improves the quality of life in patients with CBP, reducing the antibiotic use.",

Our previous work demonstrated the antibiofilm activity of EPS from Lactobacillus casei NA-2 (L.casei NA-2) isolated from northeast Chinese sauerkraut (Suan Cai). The present study has focussed on the antioxidant and immunomodulatory activities of the EPS in vitro. METHODS: Antioxidant properties of the EPS were evaluated by the radical-scavenging activities in vitro. The immunomodulatory effects of EPS were assayed by measuring nitric oxide (NO), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in RAW 264.7 macrophages, and the mechanism was investigated through NF-κB and JNK. RESULT: EPS contains 88% total sugar, with the molecular weights (Mw) of 1.3 × 106 Da, 6.4 × 105 Da, 2.0 × 105 Da, and 1.4 × 104 Da. EPS showed antioxidant activity by scavenging hydroxyl radicals (42% at 1.2 mg/mL), superoxide radicals (76% at 100 µg/mL), and DPPH (80% at 10 mg/mL); and did not affect the proliferation of unstimulated or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells at the concentrations ranging from 31.25 to 500 µg/mL. Results showed EPS promoted the production of ROS and TNF-α involved in NF-κB p65 and JNK signaling pathways in unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells. On the other hand, the levels of NO and iNOS were reduced after EPS treatment in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. CONCLUSION: Our results showed the protective effect against oxidative damage and potential immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties of EPS from Lactobacillus casei NA-2.",

The results showed that tumor inhibition in transplanted mice in the GM-CSF combined with probiotic L. casei group was significantly higher than that observed in the other groups excluding GM-CSF group whose tumor inhibition effect was considerable. The findings also indicated that the combined group could generate tumor-specific cytolytic and splenocyte proliferative responses. The levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-12 after treating with GM-CSF combined with probiotic L. casei were significantly higher than those of other groups. The intratumoral Tumor Necrosis Factor Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) was also significantly increased in the combined group. Tumor analysis further showed that the combined group decreased the accumulation of IL-10 in the tumor microenvironment of treated mice. Furthermore, tumor volume analysis demonstrated that combination group and even GM-CSF suppress tumor growth. Our findings showed that the combination of GM-CSF and probiotic results in improved tumor suppression against HPV-associated tumors and stimulates enhancement of specific antitumor immune responses.",

      "abstract": "Both inoculants treatment and enzyme treatment promote the reproduction of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to produce enough lactic acid to lower pH in silage. The present study investigated the microbial community and metabolome in cellulase, Lactobacillus casei, and air treated alfalfa silage. Chopped and wilted alfalfa (first cutting, 29% dry matter) was ensiled without (CON) or with L. casei (1 × 106 cfu g-1 fresh matter) (LC) or cellulase (20,000IU, 0.5% of fresh matter) (CE) for 56 days, then exposed to air for 3 days (PO). Greater ensiling quality was observed in LC and CE, which had lower pH and higher lactic acid content than CON at 56 days of ensiling and 3 days post-oxygen exposure. Air exposure was associated with decreased lactic acid concentrations and increased yeast and mold counts in all silages. SEM showed that the structure of leaf epicuticular wax crystals were intact in fresh alfalfa, totally decomposed in CON silage, and partly preserved in CE and LC silage. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry revealed that 196 metabolites and 95 differential concentration were present in the 3 days air exposure samples. Most of these metabolites, mainly organic acids, polyols, ketones, aldehydes, are capable of antimicrobial activity. The bacterial communities were obviously different among groups and Lactobacillus developed to a dominant status in all silages. Lactobacillus became dominant in bacterial communities of LC and CE silages from days 7 to 56, and their relative abundances reached 94.17-83.93% at day 56, respectively. For CON silage, until day 56, Lactobacillus dominated the bacterial community with abundance of 75.10%. After 3 days of oxygen exposure, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus were predominant in CON, and Lactobacillus remained dominant in LC and CE silages. The results indicated that, compared to untreated silages, L. casei could be a priority inoculant for alfalfa silage to boost Lactobacillus abundance and improve fermentation quality. Our high-throughput sequencing and gas chromatography mass spectrometry results provide a deep insight into the bacterial community and metabolites in alfalfa silage."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Lactobacillus coagulans and Lactobacillus casei probiotics on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 )-induced reproductive injury and sperm toxicity in rats. Thirty-two Wistar rats were divided into four groups as follows: sham, CCl4 (2 ml/kg), L. casei probiotic + 2 ml/kg CCl4 and L. coagulans probiotic + 2 ml/kg CCl4 . On the 36th day after the intervention, serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH) and total testosterone (T), as well as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, were measured. Testicular malondialdehyde (MDA) level, the expressions of apoptosis-related genes (Bcl-2 and Bax), Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, histomorphometric indices such as tubular differentiation index (TDI), repopulation index (RI), spermiogenesis index (SPI) and sperm parameters were evaluated. L. casei and L. coagulans probiotics improved the levels of reproductive hormones and antioxidant capacity in rats. Both the probiotics, especially L. casei, increased the rate spermatogenesis which accompanied with significant increments in testicular TDI, RI and SPI. Furthermore, both probiotics down-regulated Bax and up-regulated Bcl-2, following by decreased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Our key findings indicated that L. casei and L. coagulans have protective effects against CCl4 -induced testicular toxicity.",

However, the mechanism of fermented milk containing probiotics on constipation remains poorly understood. Volunteers with chronic constipation symptoms were recruited and given 200 g/d of fermented milk containing Lactobacillus casei Zhang and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis V9 (PFM) for 4 wk. Clinical symptoms, cytokines, metagenomics, and metabolomics were evaluated in constipated participants before and after PFM intervention. After PFM intervention, we observed significant improvement of constipation symptoms. In the serum samples, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased and the proinflammatory cytokine C-reactive protein and lipopolysaccharides decreased. Metagenomics results showed that the increase of B. animalis was correlated with an increase in defecation frequency. Fatty acid biosynthesis and bile acid biosynthesis in stool samples as well as carnitine shuttle, vitamin E metabolism, and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism were identified as significantly altered metabolic pathways. Acylcarnitine, located on the carnitine shuttle pathway, had a significantly positive correlation with defecation frequency. It was speculated that PFM may contribute to alleviating constipation symptoms through 3 potential mechanisms: fine-tuning gastrointestinal microbiota, fighting inflammation, and regulating metabolic pathways.",

      "abstract": "Chemotherapy is the most common treatment for breast cancer and its metastasis; however, it affects the patients' quality of life. Previously, it was demonstrated that milk fermented by Lactobacillus casei CRL431 (probiotic fermented milk (PFM)) exerted benefits against breast cancer metastasis by modulating the immune response in a mouse model. The aim of this work was to evaluate PFM administration on the side effects of capecitabine and on its anti-tumour/anti-metastatic effects. In vitro, 4T1 breast cancer cells were treated with capecitabine in the presence of immune cells' conditioned media from mice administered with PFM. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay. In vivo, BALB/c mice (healthy, bearing breast cancer or with potential metastasis) were treated or not with capecitabine and administered with PFM. Blood cell counts, intestinal damages, lung histology and serum cytokines were evaluated. Results showed that capecitabine's toxicity on 4T1 cells was improved by the immune cells from mice that received PFM when the lower dose of capecitabine was evaluated. PFM reduced capecitabine side effects in all the mouse models and decreased intestinal mucositis and mortality. PFM administration to mice under chemotherapy maintained the anti-cancer/anti-metastasis effect of capecitabine with similar or decreased values for serum IL-10 and TNF-α and decreased IL-6, a cytokine related to poor prognosis in advanced cancer patients. In addition, PFM by itself reduced metastasis without side effects and improved the host's immune response. PFM has a potential to be administered as an immune adjuvant in patients under chemotherapy without affecting the treatment. KEY POINTS: • Milk fermented by L. casei CRL431 (PFM) diminished capecitabine side effects. • Capecitabine's toxicity on 4T1 cells was improved by the PFM-stimulated immune cells. • PFM maintained anti-cancer/anti-metastasis effect of capecitabine in mouse models.

We used microbial dilution plate methods, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and high-throughput sequencing approaches to analyze viable main microorganism counts, short chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations, and intestinal microbiota composition in feces, respectively. Our data showed that L. casei ZX633 supplementation increased the numbers of Escherichia coli, yeasts, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and aerobic-bacteria, raised propionic acid levels but reduced four other SCFAs, which are close to the healthy group. Alpha diversity results indicated that microbial diversity and richness decreased in treatment group. Bacterial community analyses revealed that microbial structures of the treatment group tended toward the healthy group; i.e., Escherichia-Shigella and Clostridioides abundance increased, and there was a reduction in the abundance of Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Enterococcus and Veillonella. In conclusion, L. casei ZX633 isolated from healthy infant feces, may be effective in improving infant diarrhea microbiota, potentially providing a new probiotic strain to reduce the incidence of diarrhea associated with bacterial disease in infants.",

BALB/c mice were orally administered with L. casei strains for one week before HDM treatment. Ketotifen and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG were used as positive controls. All L. casei strains decreased the number of granulocytes and the levels of Th2 and Th17 inflammatory cytokines in the lungs, L. casei3 significantly decreased the airway inflammation score. Further studies showed that L. casei3, L. casei4, and L. casei5 decreased the chemokine levels, L. casei2, L. casei4, and L. casei5 promoted the secretion of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), L. casei2 upregulated the interleukin (IL)-10 levels, and L. casei1 had no effect on these immune indices. L. casei1 and L. casei4 decreased the serum levels of total IgE and HDM-specific IgG1, respectively. L. casei3 and L. casei5 decreased both HDM-specific IgG1 and total IgE levels. L. casei2 did not affect the levels of these immunoglobulins. The gut microbiota analysis revealed that all five L. casei strains enhanced the richness of the gut microbiota mainly by increasing the abundance of Firmicutes, while there were differences at the genus level.Thus, the prophylactic effects of L. casei on HDM-induced mixed chronic airway inflammatory asthma exerted as they differentially affected the immune responses and gut microbiota composition. L. casei3, which exhibited the highest prophylactic effect, increased the acetate and propionate contents in a strain-dependent manner.",

Recent reports have shown that the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in the functioning of the immune system in inflammatory diseases such as MS. In this study, the cuprizone-induced demyelination mouse model was used to investigate the effect of Lactobacillus casei strain T2 (IBRC-M10783) on the alleviation of these mice. Female C57BL/6 mice (8-10 weeks old) were divided into 6 groups: group 1, normal control; group 2, cuprizone control (oral administration of cuprizone 0.2% w/w for 4 weeks); group 3, probiotic control (oral administration of 1 × 109 CFU/ml probiotic for 4 weeks); group 4, treatment 1 (probiotic for 4 weeks then cuprizone for 4 weeks); group 5, treatment 2 (cuprizone for 4 weeks then probiotic for 4 weeks); and group 6, treatment 3 (cuprizone for 4 weeks then probiotic for 4 weeks with vitamin D3 at a dose of 20 IU/day). Then, TGF-β and IL-17 were measured by ELISA, and the expression of miR-155, miR-25, and IDO-1 was evaluated by real-time PCR. Among the measured microRNAs, the results showed that there was a significant decrease in miR-155 expression between the treatment 1 group and the cuprizone group. In the case of IL-17, the results also showed a significant reduction between the three treatment groups and the cuprizone group. These observations suggest that L. casei can reduce proinflammatory cytokines and reduce demyelinating symptoms in the mouse model.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a direct-fed microbial (DFM) product in reducing fecal shedding of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in finishing commercial feedlot cattle in Kansas (KS) and Nebraska (NE). Utilizing a randomized complete block design within the feedlot (KS, n = 1; NE, n = 1), cattle were randomly allocated to 20 pens, grouped in blocks of two based on allocation date, and then, within the block, randomly assigned to a treatment group (DFM or negative control). The DFM product was included in the diet at a targeted daily dose of 1 × 109 colony-forming units (CFU) of the Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei combination per animal for at least 60 d before sampling. Feedlots were sampled for four consecutive weeks; weekly sampling consisted of collecting 20 pen floor fecal samples per pen. Fecal samples were subjected to culture-based methods for detection and isolation of E. coli O157, and positive samples were quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Primary outcomes of interest were fecal prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli O157 supershedding (≥104 CFU/g of feces) prevalence. Data for each feedlot were analyzed at the pen level using mixed models accounting for the study design features. Model-adjusted mean E. coli O157:H7 fecal prevalence estimates (standard error of the mean [SEM]) for DFM and control groups were 8.2% (SEM = 2.2%) and 9.9% (SEM = 2.5%) in KS and 14.6% (SEM = 2.8%) versus 14.3% (SEM = 2.6%) in NE; prevalence did not differ significantly between treatment groups at either site (KS, p = 0.51; NE, p = 0.92). Mean E. coli O157 supershedding prevalence estimates for DFM and control groups were 2.2% (SEM = 0.7%) versus 1.8% (SEM = 0.7%) in KS (p = 0.66) and 6.7% (SEM = 1.5%) versus 3.2% (SEM = 1.0%) in NE (p = 0.04). In conclusion, administering the DFM product in the finishing diet of feedlot cattle did not significantly reduce E. coli O157:H7 fecal prevalence or supershedding prevalence in study pens at either commercial feedlot.",
