      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a severe illness characterized by systemic and multiorgan reactive responses and damage. However, the impact of sepsis on the bone marrow, particularly on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), is less reported. BMSCs are critical stromal cells in the bone marrow microenvironment that maintain bone stability and hematopoietic homeostasis; however, the impairment caused by sepsis remains unknown. AIM: To investigate the effects of sepsis on BMSCs and the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: BMSCs were obtained from healthy donors and patients with sepsis. We compared the self-renewal capacity, differentiation potential, and hematopoietic supportive ability in vitro. Senescence of septic BMSCs was assessed using β-galactosidase staining, senescence-associated secretory phenotype, intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, and the expression of P16 and P21. Finally, the changes in septic BMSCs after nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) treatment were evaluated. RESULTS: Septic BMSCs showed decreased proliferation and self-renewal, bias towards adipogenic differentiation, and weakened osteogenic differentiation. Additionally, hematopoietic supportive capacity declines in sepsis. The levels of aging markers were significantly higher in the septic BMSCs. After NAD treatment, the proliferation capacity of septic BMSCs showed a recovery trend, with increased osteogenic and hematopoietic supportive capacities. Sepsis resulted in decreased expression of sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) in BMSCs, whereas NAD treatment restored SIRT3 expression, enhanced superoxide dismutase enzyme activity, reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, maintained mitochondrial stability and function, and ultimately rejuvenated septic BMSCs. CONCLUSION: Sepsis accelerates the aging of BMSCs, as evidenced by a decline in self-renewal and osteogenic capabilities, as well as weakened hematopoietic support functions. These deficiencies can be effectively reversed via the NAD/SIRT3/superoxide dismutase pathway."

Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress responses, and mitochondrial dysfunction are potential factors of cognitive deficits in aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), diabetes, traumatic brain injury (TBI), vascular dementia (VAD), and schizophrenia. NAD+ precursors have received increased interest due to their unique molecular structure targets antioxidant and inflammatory pathways and mitochondrial function. The PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched through May 30, 2024. Studies investigating the effect of NAD+ precursors on cognitive impairments in rodent models were included. Two reviewers independently extracted and evaluated the data. The PRISMA guidelines for reporting systematic reviews were followed. Thirty preclinical studies were included in the review. Studies have revealed that treatment with NAD+ rescues cognitive deficits by inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis and improving mitochondrial function. Preclinical evidence has demonstrated that treatment with NAD+ precursors may be more effective in learning and memory recovery in AD, TBI, diabetes, aging, VAD, and schizophrenia. The outcomes of this investigation may lead to additional studies on the use of NAD+ precursors for treating human cognitive decline.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 54 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats aged 6-8 weeks were randomly assigned equally to three groups, sham-operated surgery (SO) with saline treatment (SO + Saline), TBI with saline treatment (TBI + Saline), and TBI with 10 μM NAD treatment (TBI + NAD). The whole brain tissues were collected at 1, 3, and 6 h following the procedure. Levels of biomarkers for TBI including S100β, TNF-α, occludin, PPARβ/δ were measured. RESULTS: Significant neuroinflammation was observed in the rat brains after TBI, which peaked at 3 h following injury. Significant changes in S100β, TNF-α, PPARβ/δ, and occluding were also observed. Treatment with NAD significantly alleviated neuroinflammation at 1 h following TBI. CONCLUSIONS: TBI caused severe neuroinflammation in rat brains, which peaked at 3 h following injury.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Metabolic reprogramming plays a critical role in modulating the innate and adaptive immune response, but its role in cutaneous autoimmune diseases, such as cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), is less well studied. An improved understanding of the metabolic pathways dysregulated in CLE may lead to novel treatment options, biomarkers and insights into disease pathogenesis. The objective was to compare metabolomic profiles in the skin and sera of CLE and control patients using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional pilot study comparing metabolomic sera and skin profiles of patients with CLE and normal controls. Patients were recruited from outpatient dermatology clinics at the University of Texas Southwestern and Parkland Health in Dallas, Texas, from January 2019 to October 2020. Skin and serum samples underwent LC-MS analysis. Disease sample metabolite levels were compared with controls, with significance levels adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing. RESULTS: 17 serum samples (9 CLE, 8 control) and 11 skin samples (5 CLE, 6 control) were analysed using LC-MS, yielding 313 known unique metabolic structures from CLE samples. Patients with CLE were found to have 11 metabolites of differential abundance in the skin, but only 2 in the sera. CLE skin showed increased levels of citrulline (log2 fold change (FC)=1.15, p=0.02) and uracil (log2FC=1.79, p=0.04), and downregulation of cyclic ADP ribose (cADPr) (log2FC=0.83, p=0.04), nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) (log2FC=0.75, p=0.016) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) (log2FC=0.86, p=0.016) versus control skin. CLE sera had increased arabinose (log2FC=1.17, p=0.02) and cystine (log2FC=1.04, p=0.03) compared with control sera. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolites associated with the NAD+ pathway may be dysregulated in the skin of patients with CLE. Available treatments including nicotinamide supplementation and anti-CD38 biologics that can correct these abnormalities can be further investigated in patients with CLE.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The pathophysiology of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is not fully elucidated. The lack of accurate diagnostic tools increases the probability of delayed diagnosis and timely treatment. The authors assessed the relationship of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (F2-IsoP) and oxidative stress biomarkers, nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), with DCI after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). METHODS: The authors assessed 65 aSAH patients for F2-IsoP, NOS3, and NADPH concentrations using commercial ELISA on days 2, 4, and 6 after aSAH. The authors examined the correlations of plasma F2-IsoP, NOS3, and NADPH concentrations and clinical variables with DCI onset. RESULTS: F2-IsoP, NOS3, and NADPH are important laboratory predictors of DCI. Of the clinical predictors, modified Fisher grade, Hunt and Hess grade, and tobacco smoking were the most significant predictors. In patients with DCI, plasma F2-IsoP and NOS3 concentrations were higher, and NADPH concentrations were lower, than in those without DCI (p < 0.01). Plasma F2-IsoP concentration on day 2, and NADPH and NOS3 concentrations on day 6, correlated with DCI occurrence (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The authors observed decreased antioxidant capacity in patients with DCI, which may be explained by increased F2-IsoP and decreased NADPH. Assessment of F2-IsoP, NOS3, and NADPH may improve the diagnostic accuracy of DCI. Further work is required to determine the role of F2-IsoP, NOS3, and NADPH in clinical practice and DCI pathophysiology."

      "abstract": "Congenital NAD deficiency disorder (CNDD) is a multisystem condition in which cardiac, renal, vertebral, and limb anomalies are most common, but anomalies in all organ systems have been identified. Patients with this condition have biallelic pathogenic variants involving genes in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) synthesis pathway leading to decreased systemic NAD+ levels. CNDD anomalies mimic the clinical features described in vertebral-anal-cardiac-tracheoesophageal fistula-renal-limb (VACTERL) association raising the possibility that CNDD and VACTERL association possess similar underlying causes. However, the mechanism by which NAD+ deficiency causes CNDD developmental anomalies has not been determined, nor has NAD+ deficiency been definitively linked to VACTERL association. Therefore, additional animal models amenable to detailed observation of embryonic development are needed to address the causes and progression of congenital anomalies in both CNDD and VACTERL association. Here, we describe a zebrafish model of NAD+ disruption to begin to model CNDD and VACTERL association phenotypes, assessing developmental anomalies in real-time. Treatment of zebrafish embryos with 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole (ATDA), a teratogen known to disrupt NAD+ metabolism, resulted in neural tube, craniofacial, cardiac, and tail defects. These defects were rescued by the administration of nicotinamide (NAM) in a dose-dependent manner. Our work establishes zebrafish as a useful model for investigating the mechanistic causes and developmental dynamics of CNDD and VACTERL association. Further, as VACTERL association has been linked to teratogens, our zebrafish model provides a platform to assess these agents."

      "abstract": "Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+) is implicated in bioenergetics, DNA repair, and senescence. Depletion of NAD+ is associated with aging and neurodegenerative disease, prompting a growing interest in NAD+ supplementation. With rising over-the-counter use of NAD, understanding their impact on anesthetic recovery becomes essential. This study investigates the effect of NADH, a common NAD+ precursor, on anesthesia in rodents. Baseline and post-anesthesia (1.5% isoflurane) open field and Y-maze activity were recorded in adult male and female C57BL/6 mice (n = 8-10/group). NADH (150 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) or vehicle (0.9% normal saline) were given at baseline or during anesthesia. The NADH-treated group exhibited a significant decrease in open-field activity relative to vehicle-treated. This diminished activity was reflected in reduced distance travelled and average velocity after emergence from anesthesia in the NADH-treated group. NADH treatment did not improve Y-maze performance after anesthesia, partly related to reduced locomotor activity in the NADH-treated group. This study demonstrates that NADH does not appear to hasten recovery from anesthesia. Instead, there was a depression in open-field activity and no change in Y-maze performance with NADH supplementation, indicators of locomotive and cognitive recovery in rodents. The broad implications of NAD+ in aging are likely to shape supplementation trends, highlighting the importance of understanding the potential influence of administering NAD+ on anesthetic sensitivity and recovery.",

      "abstract": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) significantly impairs exercise capacity and the quality of life in patients, which is influenced by dysfunctions in multiple organ systems, including the right ventricle, lungs, and skeletal muscles. Recent research has identified metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial dysfunction as contributing factors to reduced exercise tolerance in PH patients. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of enhancing mitochondrial function through the activation of the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3, using SIRT3 activator Honokiol combined with the SIRT3 co-factor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), in a Sugen/Hypoxia-induced PH rat model. Our results show that Sugen/Hypoxia-induced PH significantly impairs RV, lung, and skeletal muscle function, leading to reduced exercise capacity. Treatment with Honokiol and NAD notably improved exercise endurance, primarily by restoring SIRT3 levels in skeletal muscles, reducing proteolysis and atrophy in the gastrocnemius, and enhancing mitochondrial complex I levels in the soleus. These effects were independent of changes in cardiopulmonary hemodynamics. We concluded that targeting skeletal muscle dysfunction may be a promising approach to improving exercise capacity and overall quality of life in PH patients.",

      "abstract": "Bacteria and their predatory viruses (bacteriophages or phages) are in a perpetual molecular arms race. This has led to the evolution of numerous phage defensive systems in bacteria that are still being discovered, as well as numerous ways of interference or circumvention on the part of phages. Here, we identify a unique molecular battle between the classical biotype of Vibrio cholerae and virulent phages ICP1, ICP2, and ICP3. We show that classical biotype strains resist almost all isolates of these phages due to a 25-kb genomic island harboring several putative anti-phage systems. We observed that one of these systems, Nezha, encoding SIR2-like and helicase proteins, inhibited the replication of all three phages. Bacterial SIR2-like enzymes degrade the essential metabolic coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), thereby preventing replication of the invading phage. In support of this mechanism, we identified one phage isolate, ICP1_2001, which circumvents Nezha by encoding two putative NAD+ regeneration enzymes. By restoring the NAD+ pool, we hypothesize that this system antagonizes Nezha without directly interacting with its proteins and should be able to antagonize other anti-phage systems that deplete NAD+.IMPORTANCEBacteria and phages are in a perpetual molecular arms race, with bacteria evolving an extensive arsenal of anti-phage systems and phages evolving mechanisms to overcome these systems. This study identifies a previously uncharacterized facet of the arms race between Vibrio cholerae and its phages. We identify an NAD+-depleting anti-phage defensive system called Nezha, potent against three virulent phages. Remarkably, one phage encodes proteins that regenerate NAD+ to counter the effects of Nezha. Without Nezha, the NAD+ regeneration genes are detrimental to the phage. Our study provides new insight into the co-evolutionary dynamics between bacteria and phages and informs the microbial ecology and phage therapy fields.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is the main cause of death in middle-aged and older people and is characterized by high morbidity, high mortality, a high rehospitalization rate, and many high-risk groups. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is widely present in the mitochondria of cardiomyocytes and maintains the redox balance in the body, which can effectively treat HF. We sought to evaluate whether NAD+ therapy has some clinical efficacy in patients with HF. METHODS: Based on using conventional drugs to treat HF, patients (n = 60) were randomized 1:1 to saline and 50 mg NAD+ with 50 mL of normal saline for 7 days. The baseline characteristics of patients before and after treatment and cardiac function (N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) value) were analyzed. Serological analysis (sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), sirtuin-6 (SIRT6), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and endothelin) was also performed. RESULTS: Among the 60 patients with HF who were treated with NAD+ for 7 days, the improvement rate in NT-proBNP levels and LVEF values was better than in the saline group, although not statistically significant. These patients were more likely to benefit from NAD+ because of higher levels of anti-oxidative stress (SIRT1, SIRT3, SIRT6, and ROS) and anti-endothelial injury (endothelin) than those in the saline control group. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of this study, it is believed that 7 days of NAD+ injections has a positive effect on improving cardiac function, oxidative stress, and endothelial injury in patients with HF compared with the saline control.

This review summarizes the distribution of NAD+ at the tissue, cellular and subcellular levels, discusses its biosynthetic pathways and the latest findings in ovary, include: (1) NAD+ plays distinct roles both intracellularly and extracellularly, adapting its distribution in response to requirements. (2) Different precursors differs in target tissues, synthetic efficiency, biological utilization, and adverse effects. Importantly: tryptophan is primarily utilized in the liver and kidneys, posing metabolic risks in excess; nicotinamide (NAM) is indispensable for maintaining NAD+ levels; nicotinic acid (NA) constructs a crucial bridge between intestinal microbiota and the host with diverse functions; nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) increase NAD+ systemically and can be influenced by delivery route, tissue specificity, and transport efficiency. (3) The biosynthetic pathways of NAD+ are intricately intertwined. They provide multiple sources and techniques for NAD+ synthesis, thereby reducing the dependence on a single molecule to maintain cellular NAD+ levels. However, an excess of a specific precursor potentially influencing other pathways. In addition, Protein expression analysis suggest that ovarian tissues may preferentially utilize NAM and NMN. These findings summarize the specific roles and potential of NAD+ precursors in enhancing ovarian health. Future research should delve into the molecular mechanisms and intervention strategies of different precursors, aiming to achieve personalized prevention or treatment of ovarian diseases, and reveal their clinical application value.",

As interest in understanding NAD + dynamics in cancer patients with therapeutic applications in mind grows, there remains a shortage of comprehensive data. This study delves into NAD + dynamics in patients undergoing surgery for different digestive system cancers. This prospective study enrolled 99 patients with eight different cancers. Fasting blood samples were obtained during the perioperative period. The concentrations of NAD + , nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), and nicotinamide riboside were analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry. After erythrocyte volume adjustment, NAD + remained relatively stable after surgery. Meanwhile, NMN decreased the day after surgery and displayed a recovery trend. Interestingly, liver and pancreatic cancer patients exhibited poor postoperative NMN recovery, suggesting a potential cancer type-specific influence on NAD + metabolism. This study illuminated the behavior of NAD + in surgically treated cancer patients. We identified which cancer types have particularly low levels and at what point depletion occurs during the perioperative period. These insights suggest the need for personalized NAD + supplementation strategies, calibrated to individual patient needs and treatment timelines. Clinical trial registration jRCT1020210066.",

The present article aimed to explore the impact of tamarixetin on ischemic stroke and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Effects of tamarixetin on ischemic stroke were evaluated in rats using the middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) model, by assessing the neurological deficit scores, brain water content, brain infraction, and neuronal damage. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase expression were measured in MCAO/R rats and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells. Tamarixetin administration improved the neurological dysfunction and neuronal loss in MCAO/R rats. In addition, tamarixetin reduced microglial hyperactivation and proinflammatory cytokines expression in vivo and in vitro. Tamarixetin attenuated NF-κB p65 phosphorylation and promoter activity, reduced NLRP3 expression and caspase-1 cleavage, and downregulated IL-1β and IL-18 secretions to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The levels of superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and ROS were also suppressed by tamarixetin. The downregulation of NADP+ and NADPH levels, and gp91phox expression indicated the ameliorative effects of tamarixetin on NADPH oxidase activation. In the gp91phox knockdown cells treated with lipopolysaccharide, the effects of tamarixetin on NADPH oxidase activation, ROS generation, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation were diminished. Moreover, tamarixetin protects neurons against microglial hyperactivation in vitro. Our findings support the potential of tamarixetin as a therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke, and its mechanism of action involves the inhibition of NADPH oxidase-NLRP3 inflammasome signaling.",

Depletion of NAD+ is associated with aging and neurodegenerative disease, prompting a growing interest in NAD+ supplementation. With rising over-the-counter use of NAD, understanding their impact on perioperative recovery becomes essential. This study investigates the effect of NADH, a common NAD+ precursor, on anesthesia in rodents. Baseline and post-anesthesia (1.5% isoflurane) open field and Y-maze activity were recorded in adult male and female C57/BL6 mice (n = 8-10/group). NADH (150 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) or vehicle (0.9% normal saline) were given at baseline or during anesthesia. The NADH-treated group exhibited a significant decrease in open-field activity relative to vehicle-treated. This diminished activity was reflected in reduced distance travelled and average velocity after emergence from anesthesia in the NADH-treated group. NADH treatment did not improve Y-maze performance after anesthesia as the number of visits to the novel arm was significantly decreased. This study demonstrates a potentially adverse impact of NADH on recovery from anesthesia. We revealed a depression in open-field activity and Y-maze performance with NADH supplementation, an indicator of cognitive recovery in rodents. The broad implications of NAD+ in aging are likely to shape supplementation trends, highlighting the importance of understanding the potential influence of administering NAD+ on anesthetic sensitivity and recovery."

While their primary function is ROS production, recent research has highlighted the significance of their site-specific activity in governing distinct cellular signaling events. NADPH oxidases (Nox) are found in various cell types, and both their expression and activities are tightly regulated. The generated ROS, such as superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide, function as secondary messengers that modulate various signaling molecules, including protein kinases, transcription factors, and phosphatases. The site-specific action of NADPH oxidases in different cellular compartments, such as the plasma membrane, endosomes, and endoplasmic reticulum, allows for precise control over specific signaling pathways. Understanding the complex interplay of NADPH oxidases in cellular signaling is essential for deciphering their roles in health and disease. Dysregulation of these enzymes can lead to oxidative stress and inflammation, making them potential therapeutic targets in various pathological conditions. Ongoing research into NADPH oxidase activation and site-specific signaling promises to unveil new insights into cellular physiology and potential treatment strategies.",

Currently, there are few effective clinical treatments for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective and molecular mechanisms of exogenous nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, which can protect against hypoxic injury in adulthood, in a mouse model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. In this study, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (5 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered 30 minutes before surgery and every 24 hours thereafter. The results showed that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide treatment improved body weight, brain structure, adenosine triphosphate levels, oxidative damage, neurobehavioral test outcomes, and seizure threshold in experimental mice. Tandem mass tag proteomics revealed that numerous proteins were altered after nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide treatment in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury mice. Parallel reaction monitoring and western blotting confirmed changes in the expression levels of proteins including serine (or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 3N, fibronectin 1, 5'-nucleotidase, cytosolic IA, microtubule associated protein 2, and complexin 2. Proteomics analyses showed that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ameliorated hypoxic-ischemic injury through inflammation-related signaling pathways (e.g., nuclear factor-kappa B, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B). These findings suggest that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide treatment can improve neurobehavioral phenotypes in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury mice through inflammation-related pathways."

      "abstract": "Aims: Increasing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) availability has been proposed as a therapeutic approach to prevent neurodegeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Accordingly, NAD+ precursor supplementation appears to exert neuroprotective effects in ALS patients and mouse models. The mechanisms mediating neuroprotection remain uncertain but could involve changes in multiple cell types. We investigated a potential direct effect of the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) on the health of cultured induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human motor neurons and in motor neurons isolated from two ALS mouse models, that is, mice overexpressing wild-type transactive response DNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43) or the ALS-linked human superoxide dismutase 1 with the G93A mutation (hSOD1G93A). Results: NMN treatment increased the complexity of neuronal processes in motor neurons isolated from both mouse models and in iPSC-derived human motor neurons. In addition, NMN prevented neuronal death induced by trophic factor deprivation. In mouse and human motor neurons expressing ALS-linked mutant superoxide dismutase 1, NMN induced an increase in glutathione levels, but this effect was not observed in nontransgenic or TDP-43 overexpressing motor neurons. In contrast, NMN treatment normalized the TDP-43 cytoplasmic mislocalization induced by its overexpression. Innovation: NMN can directly act on motor neurons to increase the growth and complexity of neuronal processes and prevent the death induced by trophic factor deprivation. Conclusion: Our results support a direct beneficial effect of NAD+ precursor supplementation on the maintenance of the neuritic arbor in motor neurons. Importantly, this was observed in motor neurons isolated from two different ALS models, with and without involvement of TDP-43 pathology, supporting its therapeutic potential in sporadic and familial ALS.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes-induced cognitive impairment is a major challenge in patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. It has a complicated pathophysiology, but the role of oxidative stress is central. Therefore, the use of antidiabetic drugs with extra-glycemic effects that reduce oxidative damage may be a promising treatment option. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups as normal, normal treated, diabetic and diabetic treated (n = 8 per group). Type 1 diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal dose of streptozotocin (STZ) (40 mg/kg). Two treatment groups received empagliflozin for 5 weeks (20 mg/kg/po). Cognitive ability was evaluated using open field, Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) and the Morris Water Maze (MWM) tests at study completion. Blood and brain tissue samples were collected - and analysis for malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GLT) content and catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activity were performed. Additionally, expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase-4 (Nox-4) enzyme in brain tissue was analyzed using RT-PCR. RESULTS: STZ increased blood glucose and induced diabetes with oxidative stress by lowering the antioxidant system potency and increasing Nox-4 expression after 5-weeks in brain tissue accompanied by reduction in cognitive performance. Also, diabetes induced anxiety-like behavior and impaired spatial memory in MWM, EPM and open field tests. However, empagliflozin reversed these changes, improving SOD and CAT activity, GLT content and reducing Nox-4 expression and MDA concentration in brain tissue while improving cognitive ability. It reduced anxiety and depression-related activities. It also improved spatial memory in MWM test. CONCLUSION: Uncontrolled diabetes negatively impacts mental function and impairs learning and cognitive performance via oxidative stress induction, the Nox-4 enzyme playing a central role. Empagliflozin reverses these effects, improving cognitive ability via promoting the anti-oxidative system and damping Nox-4 free radical generator enzyme expression. Therefore, empagliflozin is a promising treatment, providing both antidiabetic and extra-glycemic benefits for improving brain function in the diabetic milieu.",

      "abstract": "Early-stage detection of chronic kidney diseases (CKD) is important to treatment that may slow and occasionally halt CKD progression. CKD of diverse etiologies share similar histologic patterns of glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis. Macro-vascular disease and micro-vascular disease promote tissue ischemia, contributing to injury. Tissue ischemia promotes hypoxia, and this in turn activates the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs). HIF-1α and HIF-2α, share a dimer partner, HIF-1β, with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and are each activated in CKD and associated with kidney cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) depletion. The Preiss-Handler, salvage, and de novo pathways regulate NAD biosynthesis and gap-junctions regulate NAD cellular retention. In the Preiss-Handler pathway, niacin forms NAD. Niacin also exhibits crosstalk with HIF and AHR cell signals in the regulation of insulin sensitivity, which is a complication in CKD. Dysregulated enzyme activity in the NAD de novo pathway increases the levels of circulating tryptophan metabolites that activate AHR, resulting in poly-ADP ribose polymerase activation, thrombosis, endothelial dysfunction, and immunosuppression. Therapeutically, metabolites from the NAD salvage pathway increase NAD production and subsequent sirtuin deacetylase activity, resulting in reduced activation of retinoic acid-inducible gene I, p53, NF-κB and SMAD2 but increased activation of FOXO1, PGC-1α, and DNA methyltransferase-1. These post-translational responses may also be initiated through non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are additionally altered in CKD. Nanoparticles traverse biological systems and can penetrate almost all tissues as disease biomarkers and drug delivery carriers. Targeted delivery of non-coding RNAs or NAD metabolites with nanoparticles may enable the development of more effective diagnostics and therapies to treat CKD.",

Results: Exogenous ROS promoted brain tumor growth in gliomasphere cultures that expressed functional phosphate and tensin homolog (PTEN), but not in tumors that were PTEN deficient. Hypoxia induced the production of endogenous cytoplasmic ROS and tumor cell growth via activation of NOX. NOX activation resulted in oxidation of PTEN and downstream protein kinase B (Akt) activation. Radiation also promoted ROS production via NOX, which, in turn, resulted in cellular protection that could be abrogated by knockdown of the key NOX component, p22. Knockdown of p22 also inhibited tumor growth and enhanced the efficacy of radiation in PTEN-expressing GBM cells. Innovation: While other studies have implicated NOX function in GBM models, this study demonstrates NOX activation and function under physiological hypoxia and following radiation in GBM, two conditions that are seen in patients. NOX plays an important role in a PTEN-expressing GBM model system, but not in PTEN-nonfunctional systems, and provides a potential, patient-specific therapeutic opportunity. Conclusion: This study provides a strong basis for pursuing NOX inhibition in PTEN-expressing GBM cells as a possible adjunct to radiation therapy. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 39, 890-903.",

We explored the physiological role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (Nox) in regulating bladder function in humans and dogs. Mucosa-denuded bladder smooth muscle strips obtained from 7 human organ donors and 4 normal dogs were mounted in muscle baths, and trains of electrical field stimulation (EFS) applied for 20 minutes at 90-second intervals. Subsets of strips were incubated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), angiotensin II (Ang II; Nox activator), apocynin (inhibitor of Noxs and ROS scavenger), or ZD7155 (specific inhibitor of angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor) for 20 minutes in continued EFS trains. Subsets treated with inhibitors were then treated with H2O2 or Ang II. In human and dog bladders, the ROS, H2O2 (100μM), caused contractions and enhanced EFS-induced contractions. Apocynin (100μM) attenuated EFS-induced strip contractions in both species; subsequent treatment with H2O2 restored strip activity. In human bladders, Ang II (1μM) did not enhance EFS-induced contractions yet caused direct strip contractions. In dog bladders, Ang II enhanced both EFS-induced and direct contractions. Ang II also partially restored EFS-induced contractions attenuated by prior apocynin treatment. In both species, treatment with ZD7155 (10μM) inhibited EFS-induced activity; subsequent treatment with Ang II did not restore strip activity. Collectively, these data provide evidence that ROS can modulate bladder function without exogenous stimuli. Since inflammation is associated with oxidative damage, the effects of Ang II on bladder smooth muscle function may have pathologic implications.",

This study investigated the efficacy of ISOA on memory impairments in the mice intrahippocampal injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the underlying mechanism. Y-maze and Morris Water Maze data suggested that ISOA (5 and 10 mg/kg) ameliorated short- and long-term memory impairments, and attenuated neuronal loss and lactate dehydrogenase activity. ISOA exerted anti-inflammatory effect demonstrating by the reduction of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 positive cells and suppression of marker protein and pro-inflammation cytokines expressions induced by LPS. ISOA suppressed the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway by inhibiting IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. ISOA inhibited superoxide and intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation by reducing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activation, demonstrating by suppressing NADP+ and NADPH contents, gp91phox expression, and p47phox expression and membrane translocation. These effects were enhanced in combination with NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin. The neuroprotective effect of ISOA was further proved in the in vitro models. Overall, our data revealed a novel pharmacological activity of ISOA: ameliorating memory impairment in AD via inhibiting neuroinflammation.",

We established three in vivo tumor models, including subcutaneous transplantation tumor model in both Balb/c nude mice (xenograft), C57BL/6J mice (allograft), and hematogenous metastatic neoplasm in nude mice. NR (400 mg/kg bw) was supplied daily in gavage. In-situ tumor growth or noninvasive bioluminescence were measured to evaluate the effect of NR on the HCC process. HepG2 cells were treated with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in the absence/presence of NR in vitro. We found that NR supplementation alleviated malignancy-induced weight loss and metastasis to lung in nude mice in both subcutaneous xenograft and hematogenous metastasis models. NR supplementation decreased metastasis to the bone and liver in the hematogenous metastasis model. NR supplementation also significantly decreased the size of allografted tumors and extended the survival time in C57BL/6J mice. In vitro experiments showed that NR intervention inhibited the migration and invasion of HepG2 cells triggered by TGF-β. In summary, our results supply evidence that boosting NAD levels by supplementing NR alleviates HCC progression and metastasis, which may serve as an effective treatment for the suppression of HCC progression.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) levels decline with aging and age-related decline in NAD has been postulated to contribute to age-related diseases. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the safety and physiologic effects of NAD augmentation by administering its precursor, β-nicotinamide mononucleotide (MIB-626, Metro International Biotech, Worcester, MA), in adults at risk for age-related conditions. METHODS: Thirty overweight or obese adults, ≥ 45 years, were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 2 MIB-626 tablets each containing 500 mg of microcrystalline β-nicotinamide mononucleotide or placebo twice daily for 28 days. Study outcomes included safety; NAD and its metabolome; body weight; liver, muscle, and intra-abdominal fat; insulin sensitivity; blood pressure; lipids; physical performance, and muscle bioenergetics. RESULTS: Adverse events were similar between groups. MIB-626 treatment substantially increased circulating concentrations of NAD and its metabolites. Body weight (difference -1.9 [-3.3, -0.5] kg, P = .008); diastolic blood pressure (difference -7.01 [-13.44, -0.59] mmHg, P = .034); total cholesterol (difference -26.89 [-44.34, -9.44] mg/dL, P = .004), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (-18.73 [-31.85, -5.60] mg/dL, P = .007), and nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased significantly more in the MIB-626 group than placebo. Changes in muscle strength, muscle fatigability, aerobic capacity, and stair-climbing power did not differ significantly between groups. Insulin sensitivity and hepatic and intra-abdominal fat did not change in either group. CONCLUSIONS: MIB-626 administration in overweight or obese, middle-aged and older adults safely increased circulating NAD levels, and significantly reduced total LDL and non-HDL cholesterol, body weight, and diastolic blood pressure. These data provide the rationale for larger trials to assess the efficacy of NAD augmentation in improving cardiometabolic outcomes in older adults.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Because stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) has a poor prognosis, it is necessary to explore new prognostic genes to stratify patients to guide existing individualized treatments. METHODS: Survival and clinical information, RNA-seq data and mutation data of STAD were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Fifty-one nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) metabolism-related genes (NMRGs) were obtained from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Reactome databases. Differentially expressed NMRGs (DE-NMRGs) between STAD and normal samples were screened, and consistent clustering analysis of STAD patients was performed based on the DE-NMRGs. Survival analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), mutation frequency analysis, immune microenvironment analysis and drug prediction were performed among different clusters. Additionally, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among different clusters were selected, and the intersections of DEGs and DE-NMRGs were selected as the prognostic genes. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed on a human gastric mucosa epithelial cell line and cancer cell line to verify the expression of the prognostic genes. RESULTS: A total of 27 DE-NMRGs and two clusters were selected. There was a difference in survival between clusters 1 and 2. Furthermore, 18 DE-NMRGs were significantly different between clusters 1 and 2. The different Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes and KEGG pathways between clusters 1 and 2 were mainly enriched in cyclic nucleotide mediated signaling, synaptic signaling and hedgehog signaling pathway, etc. The somatic mutation frequencies were different between the two clusters, and TTN was the highest mutated gene in the patients of the clusters 1 and 2. Additionally, eight immune cells, immune score, stromal score, and estimate score were different between clusters 1 and 2. The patients in cluster 2 were sensitive to CTLA4 inhibitor treatment. Furthermore, the top five drugs (AP.24534, BX.795, Midostaurin, WO2009093927 and CCT007093) were significantly higher in cluster 1 than in cluster 2. Finally, three genes (AOX1, NNMT and PTGIS) were acquired as prognostic, and their expressions were consistent with the results of bioinformatics analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Three prognostic genes related to NAD+ metabolism in STAD were screened out, which provides a theoretical basis and reference value for future treatment and prognosis of STAD."

Methods RAW264.7 cells, primary mouse macrophages (bone marrow-derived macrophages or peritoneal macrophages), and short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-NLRP3 lentivirus infected RAW264.7 cells were stimulated by different dosages of CVB3. The transcript levels of NLRP3 and IL-1β were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. IL-1β in the supernatants of cell cultures was determined by ELISA. The protein level of NLRP3 was tested by Western blot analysis and the interacting proteins of NLRP3 were detected by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). Results The transcript levels of NLRP3 and IL-1β were significantly up-regulated in the CVB3 stimulated RAW264.7 cells and primary mouse macrophages (bone marrow-derived macrophages or peritoneal macrophages). The expression level of NLRP3 presented CVB3-dose dependence and demonstrated the highest expression level at 6 hours after CVB3 treatment. The transcript level of IL-1β significantly increased the most at 6 hours after CVB3 treatment, while the protein level of IL-1β peaked at 24 hours after CVB3 treatment. In the GFP-shRNA-NLRP3 lentivirus infected RAW264.7 cells, NLRP3 was obviously inhibited, and with CVB3 stimulation, IL-1β in the supernatants of cell cultures decreased significantly. Moreover, NLRP3 antibody was used for Co-IP experiment, in which the resultant protein complex was then stained with silver nitrate. The differential protein band between different groups was identified as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide kinase 2 (NADK2) by mass spectrometry. This result demonstrated that CVB3 induced the interaction between NADK2 and NLRP3. Conclusion CVB3 stimulation promotes the activation of NLRP3 in macrophages, thereby enhancing the expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β by activating NADK2.",

During chronic stress, the heart undergoes myocardial remodeling, mainly manifested by cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, apoptosis, interstitial fibrosis, chamber enlargement, and cardiac dysfunction. The NADPH oxidase family (NOXs) are multisubunit transmembrane enzyme complexes involved in the generation of redox signals. Studies have shown that NOXs are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in the pathological development process of myocardial remodeling, which influences the development of heart failure. This review summarizes the progress of research on the pathophysiological processes related to the regulation of myocardial remodeling by NOXs, suggesting that NOXs-dependent regulatory mechanisms of myocardial remodeling are promising new therapeutic targets for the treatment of heart failure."

      "abstract": "The proteosome inhibitor bortezomib has revolutionized the treatment of multiple hematologic malignancies, but in many cases, its efficacy is limited by a dose-dependent peripheral neuropathy. We show that human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived motor neurons and sensory neurons provide a model system for the study of bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy, with promising implications for furthering the mechanistic understanding of and developing treatments for preventing axonal damage. Human neurons in tissue culture displayed distal-to-proximal neurite degeneration when exposed to bortezomib. This process coincided with disruptions in mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis, similar to those described in rodent models of bortezomib-induced neuropathy. Moreover, although the degenerative process was unaffected by inhibition of caspases, it was completely blocked by exogenous nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a mediator of the SARM1-dependent axon degeneration pathway. We demonstrate that bortezomib-induced neurotoxicity in relevant human neurons proceeds through mitochondrial dysfunction and NAD+ depletion-mediated axon degeneration, raising the possibility that targeting these changes might provide effective therapeutics for the prevention of bortezomib-induced neuropathy and that modeling chemotherapy-induced neuropathy in human neurons has utility.",

NAD-consuming enzymes can mediate post-translational modifications, such as deacylation and ADP-ribosylation, and the production of Ca2+ -mobilizing second messengers, including OAADPR, ADPR, cADPR, and NAADP, to regulate metabolic homeostasis, DNA damage and gene expression. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition characterized by impaired intestinal barrier, disturbed intestinal mucosal immunity, and abnormal intestinal repair, that is caused by genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. Although various components involved in NAD biosynthesis and metabolism are upregulated in IBD, it remains disputed whether increased NAD turnover drives or counterbalances IBD progression. This review discusses the significance of increased NAD turnover in the intestinal barrier integrity and the inflammation resolution in IBD conditions. We propose that a better understanding of the reasons for the altered NAD metabolism in IBD may help identify novel treatment approaches.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Growing evidence suggests an important role for gut dysbiosis and gut microbiota-host interactions in aging and neurodegeneration. Our previous works have demonstrated that supplementation with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursor, nicotinamide riboside (NR), reduced the brain features of AD, including neuroinflammation, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. However, the impact of NR administration on the intestinal microbiota of AD remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the relationship between gut microbiota and NR treatment in APP/PS1 transgenic (AD) mice. Compared with wild type (WT) mice, the gut microbiota diversity in AD mice was lower and the microbiota composition and enterotype were significantly different. Moreover, there were gender differences in gut microbiome between female and male AD mice. After supplementation with NR for 8 weeks, the decreased diversity and perturbated microbial compositions were normalized in AD mice. This included the species Oscillospira, Butyricicoccus, Desulfovibrio, Bifidobacterium, Olsenella, Adlercreutzia, Bacteroides, Akkermansia, and Lactobacillus. Our results indicate an interplay between NR and host-microbiota in APP/PS1 mice, suggesting that the effect of NR on gut dysbiosis may be an important component in its therapeutic functions in AD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a shortage of clinical studies examining the efficacy of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide and Enkephalinase infusions (IV1114589NAD) in treating Substance Use Disorder (SUD). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide evidence that IV1114589NAD infusions significantly attenuate substance craving behavior. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of addicted poly-drug, mixed gender, multi-ethnic individuals resistant to standard treatment. The investigation utilized Likert-Scales to assess behavioral outcomes. RESULTS: Using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and sign tests, our team detected significant results by comparing baseline to post outcome scores after IV1114589NAD injections: craving scores (P=1.063E-9); anxiety (P=5.487E-7); and depression (P=1.763E-4). A significant reduction in cravings, anxiety, and depression followed a dose-dependent linear trend. Linear trend analyses showed a significant relationship between NAD infusions and decreasing scores for cravings (P=0.015), anxiety (P=0.003), and depression (P=8.74E-5). A urine analysis was conducted on a subset of 40 patients midway through the study to assess relapse; 100% of the urine samples analyzed failed to detect illicit substance use. DISCUSSION: The opioid crisis in America has claimed close to 800,000 lives since 2004; daily deaths are estimated to stand at 127, and in 2021, over 107,000 deaths were due to overdose. There is an urgency to find safe, side-effect-free solutions. Current interventions, such as Naltrexone implants, are invasive and may interfere with dopamine homeostasis leading to an anti-reward phenomenon. Larger randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled studies are needed to elucidate further the significance of the results presented in this study. The current pilot study provides useful preliminary data regarding the effectiveness of IV1114589NAD infusions in SUD treatment. CONCLUSION: This pilot study provides significant evidence that NAD infusions are beneficial in the treatment of SUD. This investigation serves as a rationale to extend these findings onto future research investigating the use of NAD/NADH as a stand-alone treatment, especially in patients showing high genetic risk as measured in the Genetic Addiction Risk Severity (GARS) test. Utilizing GARS will help provide a real personalized therapeutic approach to treat Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS)."

      "abstract": "NAD+ is an important metabolite in cell homeostasis that acts as an essential cofactor in oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions in various energy production processes, such as the Krebs cycle, fatty acid oxidation, glycolysis and serine biosynthesis. Furthermore, high NAD+ levels are required since they also participate in many other nonredox molecular processes, such as DNA repair, posttranslational modifications, cell signalling, senescence, inflammatory responses and apoptosis. In these nonredox reactions, NAD+ is an ADP-ribose donor for enzymes such as sirtuins (SIRTs), poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) and cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPRs). Therefore, to meet both redox and nonredox NAD+ demands, tumour cells must maintain high NAD+ levels, enhancing their synthesis mainly through the salvage pathway. NAMPT, the rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway, has been identified as an oncogene in some cancer types. Thus, NAMPT has been proposed as a suitable target for cancer therapy. NAMPT inhibition causes the depletion of NAD+ content in the cell, leading to the inhibition of ATP synthesis. This effect can cause a decrease in tumour cell proliferation and cell death, mainly by apoptosis. Therefore, in recent years, many specific inhibitors of NAMPT have been developed, and some of them are currently in clinical trials. Here we review the NAD metabolism as a cancer therapy target.",

Current management of this disease primarily depends on application of fixed copper-based bactericides but climate change and resistance development in the pathogen populations still cause hardship for management of this disease, especially in south Florida. In this study, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) was evaluated in the greenhouse for its potential to reduce halo blight on snap bean. When NAD+ at 5 mM was applied by soil drench, foliar spray, or leaf infiltration, NAD+ significantly (P < 0.05) reduced disease severity of halo blight on snap bean compared with the untreated control. When NAD+ was applied by leaf infiltration, among the tested concentrations, NAD+ at 0.5 to 1.0 mM was most effective in decreasing halo blight disease. NAD+ at 2.5 mM applied as a foliar spray in rotation with Kocide 3000 (copper hydroxide) at 0.5 mg/ml further reduced disease severity compared with Kocide 3000 alone. In the in vitro study, no inhibitory effects of NAD+ were detected on the bacterial pathogen P. syringae pv. phaseolicola. Results of real-time PCR showed that the defense-related genes PR1, AZI1, EDS1, SARD1, PDF1.2, and PAL1 were upregulated in the NAD+ treatment. Taken together, these data indicated that NAD+ significantly suppressed halo blight on snap bean, and application of NAD+ has the potential in management of this important disease.",

With incidence ranging between 31% and 69%, PACS is becoming increasingly acknowledged as a new disease state in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. As SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect several organ systems to varying degrees and durations, the cellular and molecular abnormalities contributing to PACS pathogenesis remain unclear. Despite our limited understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 infection promotes this persistent disease state, mitochondrial dysfunction has been increasingly recognized as a contributing factor to acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and, more recently, to PACS pathogenesis. The biological mechanisms contributing to this phenomena have not been well established in previous literature; however, in this review, we summarize the evidence that NAD+ metabolome disruption and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction following SARS-CoV-2 genome integration may contribute to PACS biological pathogenesis. We also briefly examine the coordinated and complex relationship between increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction and speculate as to how SARS-CoV-2-mediated NAD+ depletion may be causing these abnormalities in PACS. As such, we present evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of intravenous administration of NAD+ as a novel treatment intervention for PACS symptom management."

Stress-activation of cell surface toll-like receptors (TLRs) as well as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (NOX) is also assumed to be involved in TMAO-induced inflammatory reaction in the macrophages. To elucidate the possible contribution of TLRs and NOX to the mentioned signaling pathway, we aimed to simultaneously evaluate the expression level of TLR2, TLR6, and NOX2 in TMAO-treated macrophages. METHODS: 2.5 × 106 cells of U937-derived macrophages were treated in triplicates with different concentrations (37.5, 75, 150, and 300 μM) of TMAO for 24 hours. The cells were also treated with tunicamycin (TUN), as a positive control of stress. Normal control group (CTR) cells received no treatment. The viability of treated cells was checked by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, a tetrazole (MTT) assay. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was also used to evaluate the relative expression (fold change) of TLR2, TLR6, and NOX2 at messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc Dunnett's test was performed to compare every mean with that of the control. RESULTS: No cell death occurred because of treatments. Dose of 300 μM of TMAO significantly increased the relative expression of both TLR2 and NOX2 compared to the CTR cells (P < 0.001 for both). The elevation of TLR6 was not statistically significant in all groups of TMAO-treated cells (P > 0.050). CONCLUSION: Our results provide documentation supporting contribution of TLR2 and NOX2 to previously described inflammatory reactions induced by TMAO in macrophages. In addition, they may clarify the proatherogenic role of TMAO in foam cell formation as well as abnormal activation of macrophages during atherosclerosis."

      "abstract": "Natural compounds were used in the treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI) caused by sepsis. This study investigated the function of shikonin from the roots of Arnebia purpurea in sepsis-induced AKI model. The target genes of shikonin were predicted by traditional Chinese medicine integrative database (TCMID). The markers of kidney injury, oxidative stress, and inflammatory factors were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The pathological changes of kidney tubules were assessed by Hematoxylin and Eosin staining. Apoptosis of kidney tubular epithelial cells (KTECs) was detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. Protein expression was measured by western blot. Shikonin significantly improved kidney injury induced by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP). Besides, shikonin reduced KTECs apoptosis, malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels, while augmented SOD and IL-10 levels. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase4 (NOX4) was predicted a target gene of shikonin. The expression of NOX4 was significantly inhibited in shikonin-treated group and the levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphate and dual specificity protein phosphate (PTEN) and p-p65 were decreased, while level of p-Akt was elevated. In vitro experiments, shikonin inhibited cell apoptosis, inflammatory, and ROS in human HK-2 cells and rat TECs. Shikonin downregulated expression of NOX4, PTEN and p-p65, and upregulated p-AKT and Bcl-2 expression in HK2 cells treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover, overexpression of NOX4 enhanced the effect of LPS on the expression level of PTEN, p-p65, p-AKT, and Bcl-2, which was reversed by the addition of shikonin. Taken together, shikonin could improve sepsis-induced AKI in rats, and attenuate the LPS induced KTECs apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory reaction via modulating NOX4/PTEN/AKT pathway.",

      "abstract": "Disc degeneration is the main cause of discogenic low back pain, disc herniation, degenerative stenosis of spinal canal, lumbar spondylolisthesis and other diseases. In the process of intervertebral disc degeneration, water and extracellular matrix of nucleus pulposus tissues are lost, so the normal tension in the intervertebral disc cannot be maintained, which worsens the living environment of nucleus pulposus cells. Low back pain (LBP), with a high incidence rate of disability, has become an increasing health concern and a social and economic problem. The present study aimed to analyze the action mechanisms of nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (Nampt) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). In total 26 patients with lumbar disc herniation who had surgical resection at The Third Affiliated Hospital of Jinzhou Medical University were recruited as the experimental group and their degenerative nucleus pulposus (DNP) tissues of intervertebral disc were collected. In addition, nucleus pulposus tissues of intervertebral disc were collected from 20 patients with burst fracture of lumbar spine at the same hospital (control). Nucleus pulposus cells from primary culturing were separated for subsequent experimentation. LC3 II/I, beclin-1, SIRT1 and NAMPT mRNA and protein expression levels were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting, respectively. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) contents in nucleus pulposus cells was determined by NAD assay kit. The mRNA and protein expression levels of SIRT1 in DNP tissues were reduced compared with the control tissues and decreased with increasing disease severity. The expression of autophagy-associated LC3 II/I and beclin-1 in DNP tissues was reduced compared with control tissues. SIRT1 regulated the LC3 II/I and beclin-1 expression levels in nucleus pulposus cells. Treatment with resveratrol and inhibitor of SIRT1 showed that Nampt/NAD+/SIRT1 pathway participated in the process of IVDD by regulating autophagy of nucleus pulposus cells. SIRT1 serves a role in the process of IVDD through Nampt/NAD+/SIRT1 pathway that regulates autophagy of nucleus pulposus cells. SIRT1 may become a biological target for the treatment of IVDD."

OBJECTIVE: To discuss the influence of NAD+ supplementation on adverse cardiac remodeling and aging. RESULTS: Supplementation with NAD+ precursors or nicotinamide riboside, which enhances or supplements the NAD+metabolome, might have a protective effect on the heart. NAD+ can alleviate chronic heart failure via mitochondrial oxidation-reduction (redox) state mechanism. Furthermore, NAD+ replenishment can improve the life span of mice. CONCLUSION: NAD+ exerts considerable antiaging and antioxidant effects with promising therapeutic effects. However, its effect on humans and its use as a dietary supplement need to be studied further.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate NOX2 expression and the degree of functional recovery following different types of facial nerve injury and assess the effects of antioxidant intervention on nerve regeneration. METHODS: A total of 40 mature (6-week-old) male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used. After inducing facial injury (compression injury or cutting injury), we randomized rats into four groups: A, crushing injury only; B, crushing injury with alpha lipoic acid (ALA); C, axotomy only; and D, axotomy with ALA. Recovery from facial nerve injury was evaluated 4 and 14 days after injury by performing behavioral assessments (observational scale of vibrissae movement, modified scale of eye closing and blinking reflex) and measuring changes in NOX2 experimental/control ratio in the injured (left, experimental) facial nerve relative to that in the uninjured (right, control) facial nerve. RESULTS: A comparison between groups according to the type of injury showed a higher NOX2 expression ratio in the axotomy group than in the crushing group (p < 0.001). Regardless of injury type, both groups that received an injection of ALA exhibited a trend toward a higher NOX2 expression ratio, although this difference reached statistical significance only in the axotomy group (p < 0.001). In behavioral assessments, overall behavioral test scores were significantly higher in the crushing injury group immediately after the injury compared with that in the axotomy group. Additionally, in behavioral tests conducted 4 days after the crushing injury, the group injected with ALA showed better results than the group without injection of ALA (p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that NOX2 expression trended higher with facial nerve injury, exhibiting a significant increase with cutting-type injury. Furthermore, intraperitoneally injection with ALA may be an efficient strategy for accelerating peripheral facial nerve recovery after a crushing injury."

However, early-phase trials of NAD precursors have yielded varying results and their pharmacokinetics remain incompletely understood. Here, we report the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MIB-626, a microcrystalline unique polymorph βNMN formulation. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 32 overweight or obese adults, 55-80 years, were block-randomized, stratified by sex, to 1 000-mg MIB-626 once daily, twice daily, or placebo for 14 days. NMN, NAD, and NAD metabolome were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Participant characteristics were similar across groups. MIB-626 was well tolerated and frequency of adverse events was similar across groups. Blood NMN concentrations on Day 14 in MIB-626-treated groups were significantly higher compared to placebo (1.7-times and 3.7-times increase above baseline in 1 000 mg once-daily and twice-daily groups in mean AUClast, respectively). MIB-626 treatment was associated with substantial dose-related increases in blood NAD levels. Blood levels of NAD metabolites were higher in NMN-treated participants on Days 8 and 14 than at baseline. Changes in NMN or NAD levels were not related to sex, body mass index, or age. Very little unmodified NMN was excreted in the urine. CONCLUSION: MIB-626 1 000 mg once-daily or twice-daily regimens were safe and associated with substantial dose-related increases in blood NAD levels and its metabolome. These foundational data that were obtained using a pharmaceutical-grade βNMN, standardized sample collection, and validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assays, should facilitate design of efficacy trials in disease conditions.",

JNK and the expression of Collagenα1, Collagenα2 and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were detected through RT-qPCR and Western blot and the expression in mouse liver stellate cells (JS-1) cells were evaluated through immunofluorescence staining. We detected the effects of liraglutide on NAFLD in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Liraglutide treatment improved bridging fibrosis and liver function, as well as lessening ROS levels and the protein levels of RAGE, NOX1, NOX2 and NOX4. In PA and H2O2-induced AML12 cells, liraglutide treatment was able to decrease cell apoptosis, ROS levels and the levels of inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, while it effects were reversed by the induction of RAGE overexpression or NOX2 overexpression. In JS-1 cells treated with medium culturing AML12 cells, liraglutide markedly suppressed cell proliferation and activation, while RAGE overexpression or NOX2 overexpression blunted these effects of liraglutide. Taken together, liraglutide exerts a protective role in improving liver injury caused by HFD, which could be related to decreased apoptosis and oxidative stress of liver cells, as well as decreased proliferation and activation of hepatic stellate cells through RAGE/NOX2.",

      "abstract": "Ketosis in dairy cows often occurs in the peripartal period and is accompanied by immune dysfunction. High concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in peripheral blood during ketosis inhibits the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) and contributes to immune dysfunction. However, the mechanisms whereby BHB affects NET release remains unclear. In this study, 5 healthy peripartal dairy cows (within 3 wk postpartum) with serum BHB concentrations <0.6 mM and glucose concentrations >3.5 mM were used as blood donors. Blood samples were collected before feeding, and the isolated polymorphonuclear neutrophils were incubated with 3 mM BHB for different times. Inhibition of Cit-H3 (citrullinated histone 3) protein abundance, a marker of NET activation, in response to BHB was used to determine an optimal incubation time for in vitro experiments. Four hours was selected as the optimal duration of BHB treatment. Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) was used to induce the release of NET in vitro. The BHB treatment with or without PMA treatment decreased protein abundance of Cit-H3 and PAD4 (arginine deiminase 4) and increased neutrophil elastase. Immunofluorescence and scanning electron microscope analyses revealed that BHB treatment inhibited PMA-induced NET release. The BHB treatment also decreased double strain DNA content in the supernatant, further confirming the inhibitory effect of BHB on NET release. Furthermore, BHB treatment decreased the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), phosphorylation level of p47, and protein abundance of Rac2, suggesting that BHB-induced NET inhibition may have been caused by decreased NADPH oxidase-derived ROS. The phosphorylation level of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), an important upstream regulator of NADPH oxidase, was attenuated by BHB treatment. To confirm the involvement of PI3K signaling pathway in BHB-induced NET inhibition, 740Y-P, a potent activator of PI3K signaling pathway, was used. Data indicated that 740Y-P relieved the inhibitory effects of BHB on ROS production and NADPH oxidase activation. Importantly, as revealed by immunofluorescence and scanning electron microscopy analyses, 740Y-P also dampened the inhibitory effect of BHB on NET release and the protein abundance of Cit-H3 and PAD4. Overall, the present study revealed that high concentration of BHB impairs NET release through inhibiting PI3K-mediated NADPH oxidase ROS production. These findings help partly explain the immune dysfunction in cows experiencing negative energy balance or ketosis in early lactation.",

Low NAD+ levels are linked to multiple disease states, including age-related diseases, such as metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, restoring/increasing NAD+ levels in vivo has emerged as an important intervention targeting age-related neurodegenerative diseases. One of the widely studied approaches to increase NAD+ levels in vivo is accomplished by using NAD+ precursors, such as nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). Oral administration of NMN has been shown to successfully increase NAD+ levels in a variety of tissues; however, it remains unclear whether NMN can cross the blood-brain barrier to increase brain NAD+ levels. This study evaluated the effects of oral NMN administration on NAD+ levels in C57/B6J mice brain tissues. Our results demonstrate that oral gavage of 400 mg/kg NMN successfully increases brain NAD+ levels in mice after 45 min. These findings provide evidence that NMN may be used as an intervention to increase NAD+ levels in the brain.",

Thus, maintaining cellular NADH and NADPH balance is critical for sustaining cellular homeostasis. The sources of NADPH generation might determine its biological effects. Newly-recognized biosynthetic enzymes and genetically encoded biosensors help us better understand how cells maintain biosynthesis and distribution of compartmentalized NAD(H) and NADP(H) pools. It is essential but challenging to distinguish how cells sustain redox couple pools to perform their integral functions and escape redox stress. However, it is still obscure whether NADPH is detrimental or beneficial as either deficiency or excess in cellular NADPH levels disturbs cellular redox state and metabolic homeostasis leading to redox stress, energy stress, and eventually, to the disease state. Additional study of the pathways and regulatory mechanisms of NADPH generation in different compartments, and the means by which NADPH plays a role in various diseases, will provide innovative insights into its roles in human health and may find a value of NADPH for the treatment of certain diseases including aging, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cardiovascular diseases, ischemic stroke, diabetes, obesity, cancer, etc.",

DESIGN: Thirty-eight rats were randomized into three groups: 1) Sham, 2) Control, and 3) NAD. Except for the sham group, untreated ventricular fibrillation for 6 minutes followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed in the control and NAD groups. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide+ (20 mg/kg) was IV administered at the onset of return of spontaneous circulation. SETTING: University-affiliated research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Sprague-Dawley rats. INTERVENTIONS: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide+. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Hemodynamic and myocardial function were measured at baseline and within 4 hours following return of spontaneous circulation. Survival analysis and Neurologic Deficit Score were performed up to 72 hours after return of spontaneous circulation. Adenosine triphosphate (adenosine triphosphate) level was measured in both brain and heart tissue. Mitochondrial respiratory chain function, acetylation level, and expression of Sirtuin3 and NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 alpha subcomplex, 9 (NDUFA9) in isolated mitochondrial protein from both brain and heart tissue were evaluated at 4 hours following return of spontaneous circulation. The results demonstrated that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide+ treatment improved mean arterial pressure (at 1 hr following return of spontaneous circulation, 94.69 ± 4.25 mm Hg vs 89.57 ± 7.71 mm Hg; p < 0.05), ejection fraction (at 1 hr following return of spontaneous circulation, 62.67% ± 6.71% vs 52.96% ± 9.37%; p < 0.05), Neurologic Deficit Score (at 24 hr following return of spontaneous circulation, 449.50 ± 82.58 vs 339.50 ± 90.66; p < 0.05), and survival rate compared with that of the control group. The adenosine triphosphate level and complex I respiratory were significantly restored in the NAD group compared with those of the control group. In addition, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide+ treatment activated the Sirtuin3 pathway, down-regulating acetylated-NDUFA9 in the isolated mitochondria protein. CONCLUSIONS: Exogenous nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide+ treatment attenuated postresuscitation myocardial and neurologic dysfunction. The responsible mechanisms may involve the preservation of mitochondrial complex I respiratory capacity and adenosine triphosphate production, which involves the Sirtuin3-NDUFA9 deacetylation.",

The molecular weight and purity of ACE were found with SDS-PAGE and observed two bands at about 60 kDa and 70 kDa on the gel. The effects of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), an antioxidant compound, on purified ACE activity were also researched. NADH on ACE activity showed an inhibition effect. The inhibition type of NADH was determined to be non-competitive inhibition by the Lineweaver-Burk chart and IC50 and Ki values for NADH were 244.33 and 175.08 µM, respectively.

Although preclinical and pharmaceutical studies were performed to investigate the potential of natural compounds in minimizing DOX toxicity, a comprehensive review of them is not available. This review can help the researchers for an effective search strategy. KEY FINDINGS: Oxidative stress and p53 play an important role in DOX-associated cardiotoxicity. DOX activates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NADPH oxidase (NOX) in the heart, resulting in excessive reactive oxygen species that can induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis through phosphorylation of p53, DNA damage and/or mitogen-activated protein kinases-mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Although a few chemical drugs with high efficacy are administered along with DOX to prevent or more likely to reduce cardiovascular toxicity, their use is often limited by additional side effects. Recently, attention has been drawn to natural compounds that prevent DOX cardiotoxicity. This review focuses on some of the natural bioactive compounds with potential therapeutic efficacy against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC). SUMMARY: Some natural compounds, especially flavonols, flavonoids and proanthocyanidins, have the most protective effects against DIC by forming stable radicals and preventing the assembly of the NOX subunits.",

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) can protect against cell apoptosis and attenuate MS-triggered symptoms. However, the effect of NAD+ on MS-triggered ON remains unclear. Herein, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was established by immunizing female C57BL/6 mice with MOG35-55 peptide. To investigate the effect of NAD+ on ON prevention and treatment, EAE mice received 250 mg/kg NAD+ daily via intraperitoneal injection after immunization and EAE onset, respectively. EX-527 (10 mg/kg, SIRT1 inhibitor) was intraperitoneally injected every two days to explore the role of SIRT1 in NAD+-induced therapeutic effect on EAE. NAD+ intervention attenuated the severity of EAE in mice. NAD+ intervention relieved inflammatory infiltration and CD3+ and CD4+ cell infiltration and decreased the number and activation of microglia and astrocytes in the optic nerve. NAD+ intervention also attenuated demyelination, axonal loss, oligodendrocyte apoptosis and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell recruitment and proliferation in the optic nerve and protected against RGC apoptosis in the retina. NAD+ intervention decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA and pro-apoptotic protein expression and enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression and the SIRT1 signaling in the optic nerve and retina and regulated the Th1/Th17/Tregs immune response in the spleen. In addition, EX-527 reversed the therapeutic effect of NAD+ on EAE, suggesting that NAD+ prevented MS-triggered ON by activating the SIRT1 signaling pathway. This study shows the potential of NAD+ to be used as a drug in preventing and treating MS-related ON.",

Concomitantly, the pharmacological manipulation of metabolic processes offers an opportunity for therapeutic intervention in inflammatory disorders. The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ ) is a critical metabolic intermediate that serves as enzyme cofactor in redox reactions, and is also used as a co-substrate by many enzymes such as sirtuins, adenosine diphosphate ribose transferases and synthases. Through these activities, NAD+ metabolism regulates a broad spectrum of cellular functions such as energy metabolism, DNA repair, regulation of the epigenetic landscape and inflammation. Thus, the manipulation of NAD+ availability using pharmacological compounds such as NAD+ precursors can have immune-modulatory properties in inflammation. Here, we discuss how the NAD+ metabolism contributes to the immune response and inflammatory conditions, with a special focus on multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases and inflammageing.

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the main human dementias around the world which is constantly increasing every year due to several factors (age, genetics, environment, etc.) and there are no prevention or treatment options to cure it. AD is characterized by memory loss associated with oxidative stress (OS) in brain cells (neurons, astrocytes, microglia, etc.). OS can be produced by amyloid beta (Aβ) protein aggregation and its interaction with metals, mitochondrial damage and alterations between antioxidants and oxidant enzymes such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. NADPH oxidase produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) and it is overexpressed in AD, producing large amounts of superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide which damage brain cells and the vasculature. In addition, it has been reported that NADPH oxidase causes an imbalance of pH which could also influence in the amyloid beta (Aβ) production. Therefore, NADPH oxidase had been proposed as a therapeutic target in AD. However, there are no drugs for AD treatment such as an NADPH oxidase inhibitor despite great efforts made to stabilize the ROS production using antioxidant molecules. So, in this work, we will focus our attention on NADPH oxidase (NOX2 and NOX4) in AD as well as in AD models and later discuss the use of NADPH oxidase inhibitor compounds in AD."

While in nature, NAD+ is continuously regenerated from NADH by enzymes, all synthetic NAD+ regeneration strategies require a continuous supply of expensive reagents and generate byproducts, making these strategies unattractive. In contrast, we present an artificial enzyme combination that produces NAD+ from oxygen and water continuously; no additional organic substrates are required once a minimal amount pyruvate is supplied. Three enzymes, i.e., LDH, LOX, and CAT, are covalently encapsulated into a substrate-permeable silica nanoreactor by a mild fluoride-catalyzed sol-gel process. The enzymes retain their activity inside of the nanoreactors and are protected against proteolysis and heat. We successfully used NAD+ from the nanoreactors for the continuous production of NAD+ i) to sense glucose in artificial glucose metabolism, and ii) to reduce the non-oxygen binding methemoglobin to oxygen-binding hemoglobin. This latter conversion might be used for the treatment of Methemoglobinemia. We believe that this versatile tool will allow the design of artificial NAD+ -dependent metabolisms or NAD+ -mediated redox-reactions.",

      "abstract": "The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an important small biomolecule that participates in a variety of physiological functions, and it has been regarded as a potential biomarker for disease diagnosis and a promising target for disease treatment. The conventional methods for NAD+ assay often suffer from complicated procedures, expensive labeling, poor selectivity, and unsatisfactory sensitivity. Herein, we develop a label-free and sensitive method for NAD+ assay based on the integration of a trifunctional split dumbbell probe with ligation-triggered isothermal rolling circle amplification (RCA). We design a trifunctional split dumbbell probe that can act as a probe for NAD+ recognition, a template for RCA reaction, and a substrate for SYBR Green I binding. In the presence of target NAD+, it can serve as a cofactor to active E. coli DNA ligase which subsequently catalyzes the ligation of split dumbbell probe to form a circular template for RCA reaction, generating numerous dumbbell probe amplicons which can be easily and label-free monitored by using SYBR Green I as the fluorescent indicator. Due to the high fidelity of NAD+-dependent ligation and high amplification efficiency of RCA amplification, this method exhibits high sensitivity with a detection limit of 85.6 fM and good selectivity with the capability of discriminating target NAD+ from its analogs. Moreover, this method can be applied for accurate and sensitive detection of NAD+ in complex biological samples and cancer cells, holding great potential in NAD+-related biological researches and clinical diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) is an essential cofactor in numerous metabolic pathways, and so may support protective and reparative processes against central nervous system diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of NAD + administration in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS and the contributions of autophagic regulation and NLRP3 inflammasome activity. EAE was induced in female C57BL/6 mice by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) p35-55 and disease severity analyzed by neurological function score and histological scores of spinal cord sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin or luxol fast blue. Outcomes were compared among control mice and EAE groups receiving daily post-immunization vehicle injections, NAD + injections, injection of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA), or co-injection of NAD + and 3-MA. Expression levels of autophagy-related proteins (Beclin1, LC3-II/I, and p62/SQSTM1) were assessed by Western blotting, the activated microglial cells were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, while mRNA expression levels of NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-17, IL-18, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and IL-10 were detected by real-time PCR. The proportions of Th1 and Th17 cells in spleen were evaluated using flow cytometry. Treatment with NAD + alleviated demyelination, nerve injury, microglial activation and motor function abnormalities of EAE mice. In addition, NAD + increased the expressions of the autophagy-related proteins LC3-II/I and Beclin 1, and reduced the expression of p62. Treatment with NAD + also inhibited the expressions of NLRP3 and modulated the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells, reduced the expressions of the pro-inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-2, IL-18, IFN-γ and IL-17, and increased the expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10. Conversely, 3-MA aggravated spinal cord inflammation and demyelination, and delayed spontaneous remission from EAE. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of NAD + were abolished by 3-MA cotreatment. Our results indicate that NAD + suppresses the NLRP3 inflammasome at least in part through the activation of autophagy to relieve the symptoms of EAE. Therefore, regulation of autophagy by NAD + treatment may be an effective therapeutic strategy for MS.",

METHODS: Macrophages cultured in vitro were divided into seven groups: control, model control, inhibitor, positive control, 2.5% JHTG, 5% JHTG, and 10% JHTG. An oxidative stress injury model was established by stimulating macrophages with oxidized low-density lipoprotein. Cell survival and apoptosis were detected by 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-y1)-3,5-di- phenytetrazoliumromide and flow cytometry assays, respectively. Malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, while ROS levels were detected using a fluorescence probe. Proteins and mRNAs associated with the NOX/ROS-NF-κB pathway, including NOX4, p22phox, inhibitor of NF-κB kinase-α (IKK-α), inhibitor of NF-κB kinase-β (IKK-β), and NF-κB were detected by Western blot and PCR, respectively. RESULTS: After JHTG treatment, there were fewer damaged and apoptotic macrophages, while superoxide dismutase levels were elevated. The JHTG-treated groups also showed reduced ROS levels. The molecular changes following JHTG treatment included decreased expression of NOX4 and p22phox at the protein level and decreased IKK-α, IKK-β, and NF-κB expression at the mRNA level. All of these effects were correlated with the JHTG concentration. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that the molecular mechanism underlying the antioxidant activity of JHTG in macrophages is through inhibiting the NOX/ROS-NF-κB pathway.",

      "abstract": "Ferroptotic antitumor therapy has been compromised by various intracellular antioxidants, particularly glutathione and thioredoxin. Both are cofactors of glutathione peroxide 4 (GPX4) that act against oxidative stress via catalyzing the reduction of lipid peroxides. It was postulated that tailored polymer micelles could enhance ferroptotic antitumor efficacy via diminishing glutathione and thioredoxin under hypoxia. The aim was to engineer hypoxia-responsive micelles for selective enhancement of ferroptotic cell death in solid tumor. The polymer contains hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) that is linked by azobenzene linker with nitroimidazole-conjugated polypeptide. The tailored polymer could self-assemble into nanoscale micelles to encapsulate RAS-selective lethal small molecule 3, a covalent GPX4 inhibitor. Under hypoxia, the azobenzene moiety enabled PEG shedding and enhanced micelles uptake in 4T1 cells. Likewise, the nitroimidazole moiety was reduced by the overexpressed nitroreductase with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as the cofactor, resulting in transient depletion of NADPH. This impaired both the glutathione and thioredoxin redox cycle, leading to diminished intracellular glutathione and thioredoxin. The selective potency of ferroptotic micelles in depleting NADPH, glutathione and thioredoxin was further verified in vivo in the 4T1 tumor xenograft mice model. This work highlights the role of hypoxia-responsive polymers in enhancing the potency of ferroptotic inducers against solid tumors without additional side effects to healthy organs.",

      "abstract": "The ability of a ketogenic diet to treat seizures and render a neuronal network more resistant to strong electrical activity has been observed for a century in clinics and for decades in research laboratories. Alongside ongoing efforts to understand how this therapy works to stop seizures, metabolic health is increasingly appreciated as critical buffer to resisting and recovering from acute and chronic disease. Accordingly, links between metabolism and health, and the broader emerging impact of the ketogenic diet in improving diverse metabolic, immunological and neurological conditions, have served to intensify the search for its key and/or common mechanisms. Here we review diverse evidence for increased levels of NAD+, and thus an altered ratio of NAD+/NADH, during metabolic therapy with a ketogenic diet. We propose this as a potential unifying mechanism, and highlight some of the evidence linking altered NAD+/NADH with reduced seizures and with a range of short and long-term changes associated with the beneficial effects of a ketogenic diet. An increase in NAD+/NADH is consistent with multiple lines of evidence and hypotheses, and therefore we suggest that increased NAD+ may be a common mechanism underlying beneficial effects of ketogenic diet therapy.",

In this work, a catalytic oxidation pathway of phenanthrene resulted by extracellular secretions of P. aeruginosa NY3 was proposed. Results of the in vitro experiments showed that, the extracellular secretions of Pyocyanin (Pyo) and Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NADH) acted as homogeneous catalysts because which produced H2O2, hydroxyl free radical and superoxide anion radical continuously under aerobic conditions. These produced reactive oxygen species oxidized the phenanthrene in aqueous solution, leading to the cleavage of the phenanthrene ring and the formation of phthalates products and low molecular weight metabolites (such as alkanoic acids). The ratio of BOD5/COD of phenanthrene-containing wastewaters was greatly improved after treating with Pyo and NADH. Results of the in vivo experiments showed that, pre-degradation of phenanthrene by extracellular fluid simultaneously containing Pyo and NADH, promoted cell growth of P. aeruginosa NY3, which confirmed the improvement of bioavalability of phenanthrene-containing wastewaters by the catalytic oxidation of Pyo and NADH. Further details of the free radical detection indicated that, the increase in secretion of Pyo by a bacterium was favorable to the production of H2O2 in the extracellular fluid.",

      "abstract": "Aging and obesity are the most prominent risk factors for onset of atrial fibrillation (AF). Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) is the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) activity. Nampt and NAD are essential for maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis and modulation of cellular metabolism, and their expression levels decrease with aging and obesity. However, a role for Nampt in AF is unknown. The present study aims to test whether there is a role of Nampt/NAD axis in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced AF. Male C57BL/6J (WT) mice and heterozygous Nampt knockout (NKO) mice were fed with a normal chow diet (ND) or a high-fat diet (HFD). Electrophysiological study showed that AF inducibility was significantly increased in WT+HFD, NKO+ND, and NKO+HFD mice compared with WT+ND mice. AF duration was significantly longer in WT+HFD and NKO+ND mice and further prolonged in NKO+HFD mice compared with WT+ND mice and the calcium handling pathway was altered on molecular level. Also, treatment with nicotinamide riboside, a NAD precursor, partially restored the HFD-induced AF perpetuation. Overall, this work demonstrates that partially deletion of Nampt facilitated HFD-induced AF through increased diastolic calcium leaks. The Nampt/NAD axis may be a potent therapeutic target for AF.",

      "abstract": "One of the biochemical abnormalities found in diabetic tissues is a decrease in the cytosolic oxidized to reduced forms of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ratio (NAD+ /NADH also known as pseudohypoxia) caused by oxidation of excessive substrates (glucose through the polyol pathway, free fatty acids and lactate). Subsequently, a decline in NAD+ levels as a result of the activation of poly adenine nucleotide diphosphate-ribose polymerase (mainly in type 1 diabetes) or the inhibition of adenine nucleotide monophosphate-activated protein kinase (in type 2 diabetes). Thus, replenishment of NAD+ levels by nicotinamide-related compounds could be beneficial. However, these compounds also increase nicotinamide catabolites that cause oxidative stress. This is particularly troublesome for patients with diabetes, because they have impaired nicotinamide salvage pathway reactions at the level of nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, which occurs by the following mechanisms. First, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthesis from pentose phosphate pathway is compromised by a decrease in plasma thiamine and transketolase activity. Second, nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase expression is decreased because of reduced adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activity, which occurs in type 2 diabetes. The adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase inhibition is caused by an activation of protein kinase C and D1 as a result of enhanced diacylglycerol synthesis caused by pseudohypoxia and increased fatty acids levels. In this regard, nicotinamide-related compounds should be given with caution to treat diabetes. To minimize the risk and maximize the benefit, nicotinamide-related compounds should be taken with insulin sensitizers (for type 2 diabetes), polyphenols, benfotiamine, acetyl-L-carnitine and aldose reductase inhibitors. The efficacy of these regimens can be monitored by measuring serum NAD+ and urinary nicotinamide catabolites.",

METHODS: The bone marrow of femur and tibia of New Zealand white rabbits were extracted. BMSCs were isolated and cultured in vitro by density gradient centrifugation combined with adherent culture. The third generation cells were identified by flow cytometry and multi-directional induction. Overexpression of NMNAT3 gene was transfected into rabbit BMSCs by enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) labeled lentivirus (BMSCs/Lv-NMNAT3-EGFP), and then the expression of NMNAT3 was detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot and cell proliferation by cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) method. BMSCs transfected with negative lentivirus (BMSCs/Lv-EGFP) and untransfected BMSCs were used as controls. The oxidative stress injury cell model was established by using H 2O 2 to treat rabbit BMSCs. According to the experimental treatment conditions, they were divided into 4 groups: Group A was normal BMSCs without H 2O 2 treatment; untransfected BMSCs, BMSCs/Lv-EGFP, and BMSCs/Lv-NMNAT3-EGFP in groups B, C, and D were treated with H 2O 2 simulated oxidative stress, respectively. The effects of NMNAT3 on the mitochondrial function of BMSCs under oxidative stress [changes of mitochondrial membrane potential, NAD + and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels], the changes of anti-oxidative stress ability of BMSCs [reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities], and the effects of BMSCs on senescence and apoptosis [senescence associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining and TUNEL staining] were detected after 24 hours of treatment. RESULTS: The rabbit BMSCs were successfully isolated and cultured in vitro. The stable strain of rabbit BMSCs with high expression of NMNAT3 gene was successfully obtained by lentiviral transfection, and the expressions of NMNAT3 gene and protein significantly increased ( P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the trend of cell proliferation compared with normal BMSCs. After treatment with H 2O 2, the function of mitochondria was damaged and apoptosis increased in all groups. However, compared with groups B and C, the group D showed that the mitochondrial function of BMSCs improved, the membrane potential increased, the level of NAD + and ATP synthesis of mitochondria increased; the anti-oxidative stress ability of BMSCs enhanced, the levels of ROS and MDA decreased, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes (Mn-SOD, CAT) increased; and the proportion of SA-β-gal positive cells and the rate of apoptosis decreased. The differences in all indicators between group D and groups B and C were significant ( P<0.05). CONCLUSION: NMNAT3 can effectively improve the mitochondrial function of rabbit BMSCs via increasing the NAD + levels, and enhance its anti-oxidative stress and improve the survival of BMSCs under oxidative stress conditions.",

Our previous studies have found that PC can alleviate the liver oxidative stress of juvenile mice with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and its mechanism is related to the inhibition of the protein kinase C-α (PKC-α)/nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX) signaling pathway. The aim of this study was to confirm the aforementioned drug target in vitro and to conduct preliminary screening for some effective compounds of PC on the treatment of NASH. A primary hepatocyte model of non alcoholic fatty liver disease was established by palmitic acid. The existence of Psoralen, Isopsoralen, Neobavaisoflavone, Isobavachalcone, and Bakuchiol were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Then, five PC compounds were administered. Intracellular triglyceride and total cholesterol content, the cell supernatant alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, and hepatocellular superoxide anion were examined. The changes of PKC-α/NOX signaling pathways in hepatocytes were also determined. Furthermore, PKC-α activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was administered for 4 h before Psoralen intervention was conducted again to detect the changes of PKC-α/NOX signaling pathways. Our data demonstrated that Psoralen, Isopsoralen, and Isobavachalcone decreased intracellular content of triglyceride while all five PC compounds improved hepatocellular total cholesterol accumulation and hepatocyte damage in palmitic acid-induced primary hepatocyte model of non alcoholic fatty liver disease. All five PC compounds could also reduce hepatocytic superoxide anion levels, nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate/reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate ratio, NOX activity as well as p47phox protein expression and PKCα activation in hepatocytes. Psoralen exhibited the best efficacy but the effectiveness was lost when pre-stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The results suggest that Psoralen, Isopsoralen, and Isobavachalcone could improve hepatocyte steatosis; five PC compounds could ameliorate hepatocyte injury, relieve oxidative stress, and downregulate the PKC-α/NOX signaling pathway of hepatocytes. In addition, Psoralen exhibits the best efficacy and a prospective PKC-α inhibitor pharmaceutical activity."

      "abstract": "Significance: The growing incidence of neurodegenerative diseases significantly impacts the individuals who suffer from these disorders and is a major health concern globally. Although the specific mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases are still far from being acknowledged, it is becoming clear that oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are critical contributing factors to the progression of neurodegeneration. Thus, it is conceivable that the inhibition of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation may represent promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent Advances: Recently, the strategy for neurodegenerative disease therapy has shifted from the use of antioxidants and conventional anti-inflammatory targets to upstream mediators due to the failure of most antioxidants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in clinical trials. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases (NOXs), a family of superoxide-producing enzyme complexes, have been identified as an upstream factor that controls both oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Genetic inactivation or pharmacological inhibition of NOX enzymes displays potent neuroprotective effects in a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative disease models. Critical Issues: The detailed mechanisms of how NOX enzymes regulate oxidative stress and neuroinflammation still remain unclear. Moreover, the currently available inhibitors of NOX enzymes exhibit nonspecificity, off-target effects, unsuitable pharmacokinetic properties, and even high toxicity, markedly limiting their potential clinical applications. Future Directions: This review provides novel insights into the roles of NOXs in neurodegenerative pharmacology, and indicates the types of NOX enzyme inhibitors that should be identified and developed as candidates for future applications, which might reveal novel neurodegenerative disease therapies based on NOXs.",

      "abstract": "Significance: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production occurs primarily in the mitochondria as a by-product of cellular metabolism. ROS are also produced by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases in response to growth factors and cytokines by normal physiological signaling pathways. NADPH oxidase, a member of NADPH oxidase (NOX) family, utilizes molecular oxygen (O2) to generate ROS such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide. Imbalance between ROS production and its elimination is known to be the major cause of various human diseases. NOX family proteins are exclusively involved in ROS production, which makes them attractive target(s) for the treatment of ROS-mediated diseases including cancer. Recent Advances: Molecules such as Keap1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors, nuclear factor-kappaB, KRAS, kallistatin, gene associated with retinoic-interferon-induced mortality-19, and deregulated metabolic pathways are involved in ROS production in association with NADPH oxidase. Critical Issues: Therapeutic strategies targeting NADPH oxidases in ROS-driven cancers are not very effective due to its complex regulatory circuit. Tumor suppressor microRNAs (miRNAs) viz. miR-34a, miR-137, miR-99a, and miR-21a-3p targeting NADPH oxidases are predominantly downregulated in ROS-driven cancers. miRNAs also regulate other cellular machineries such as Keap1/Nrf2 pathway and NMDA receptors involved in ROS production and consequently drug resistance. Here, we discuss the structure, function, and metabolic role of NADPH oxidase, NOX family protein-protein interaction, their association with other pathways, and NADPH oxidase alteration by miRNAs. Moreover, we also discuss and summarize studies on NADPH oxidase associated with various malignancies and their therapeutic implications. Future Directions: Targeting NADPH oxidases through miRNAs appears to be a promising strategy for the treatment of ROS-driven cancer.",

Methods: Twenty-two healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: control group (6 rats), model group (8 rats) and benazepril treatment group (8 rats). Two rats died during modeling and treatment in the model group and the benazepril treatment group, and a model of hepatic fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCL(4)) was established. The rats in benazepril group were given benazepril for 8 weeks by gastric gavage. The assessment of liver tissue damage in each group was measured using conventional hematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining. The mRNA level of Nrf2, NOX4 in liver tissue was detected by RT-PCR, and serum ROS concentration was determined by colorimetry. All data were expressed in mean ± standard deviations, and were analyzed using SPSS21.0 statistical software. The data were compared using one-way analysis of variance, and the LSD-t method was used for pairwise comparison between the two groups. The correlation analysis was performed by Spearman's correlation analysis. Results: In the liver of the model group, with the aggravation of liver fibrosis the expression of Nrf2mRNA, NOX4 mRNA and ROS concentration were higher than control group [(4.01 ± 3.40), (31.78 ± 3.96), (1.82 ± 0.46) μg/ ml vs. (0.12 ± 0.11), (2.03 ± 0.31), (1.56±0.84) μg/ml, P < 0.05]. After benazepril treatment, NOX4 mRNA expression and ROS concentration were decreased than the model group [(15.93 ± 5.01), (0.78 ± 0.44) μg/ml vs. (31.78 ± 3.96), (1.82 ± 0.46) μg /ml, P < 0.05], while Nrf2 mRNA expression was higher than the model group [(6.69 ± 4.86) vs. (4.01 ± 3.40), P < 0.05]. There was a positive correlation between Nrf2 and NOX4, Nrf2 and ROS, and NOX4 and ROS (r = 0.616, 0.411, 0.802, P < 0.05). Conclusion: Benazepril may exert an anti-hepatic fibrosis effect by activating Nrf2 expression, or may inhibit the ROS-mediated oxidative stress in response to NOX4.",

      "abstract": "Aims: Vascular calcification (VC) is a hallmark feature of cardiovascular disease and a significant risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Salusin-β exerts cardiovascular regulating effects in hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. The present study was designed to examine the roles of salusin-β in the progression of VC and its downstream signaling mechanisms. Results: Salusin-β expression in both the aortas of VC rats induced by vitamin D3 and nicotine and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) incubated with calcifying media was increased. Salusin-β knockdown remarkably reduced VC, whereas overexpression of salusin-β exacerbated VC both in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of salusin-β promoted the VSMC osteochondrogenic transition, decreased Klotho protein levels, enhanced Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) activity and the translocation of p47phox to the membrane, increased the expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NAD(P)H] oxidase subunits and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with or without calcifying media; however, salusin-β deficiency played the opposite roles. The calcification and downregulated Klotho protein levels induced by salusin-β were restored by ROS scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine, diphenyleneiodonium chloride [an inhibitor of flavin-containing enzyme, including NAD(P)H oxidase], or gene knockdown of NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX)-2, p22phox, or p47phox but were not affected by NOX-1 and NOX-4 knockdown. Klotho knockdown attenuated the protective effect of salusin-β deficiency on VSMC calcification. By contrast, exogenous Klotho ameliorated the development of VC and ROS generation induced by salusin-β overexpression. Innovation: Salusin-β is a critical modulator in VC. Conclusion: Salusin-β regulates VC through activation of NAD(P)H/ROS-mediated Klotho downregulation, suggesting that salusin-β may be a novel target for treatment of VC.",

      "abstract": "The metabolic disorder of succinate in myocardial tissue during ischemia-reperfusion can lead to the myocardial oxidative injury. The activation of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) plays a vital role in the process. Silent information regulator 5 (Sirt5), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent desuccinylase, desuccinylates and inactivates SDH thus exerting a protective effect on the myocardium. This research was designed to investigate whether exogenous NAD protects the myocardium from the ischemia-reperfusion-induced oxidative injury through regulating Sirt5-SDH pathway and succinate metabolism. We first found that myocardial total NAD level was remarkably increased with NAD treatment (10 mg/kg) for 14 days. NAD administration significantly decreased the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level in coronary leakage, decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) level and increased the reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione disulfide ratio (GSH/GSSG) in myocardial tissue. In addition, NAD treatment effectively attenuated the depression of cardiac function in the isolated rat hearts after ischemia-reperfusion. Furthermore, we found that exogenous NAD attenuated the succinate accumulation during ischemia and decreased its depleting rate during reperfusion. We also found that NAD administration had no obvious effects on myocardial Sirt5 and SDH-a expressions. However, the results of immunofluorescence showed that Sirt5 and SDH-a interacted in ischemia-reperfused myocardium. Utilizing co-immunoprecipitation method, we found that NAD administration promoted the Sirt5 and SDH-a interaction and decreased the succinylation level of SDH-a. These results implied that exogenous NAD administration promoted Sirt5-mediated SDH-a desuccinylation and decreased the activity of SDH-a, which attenuated the succinate accumulation during ischemia and its depleting rate during reperfusion and finally alleviated reactive oxygen species generation.",

Here, we report the mechanism of seizure onset relevant to most seizures that are characteristic of focal epilepsies. METHODS: Electric and metabolic network parameters were measured using several seizure models in mouse hippocampal slices and acutely induced seizures in rats in vivo to determine metabolic events occurring at seizure onset. RESULTS: We show that seizure onset is associated with a rapid release of H2 O2 resulting from N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX). NOX blockade prevented the fast H2 O2 release as well as the direct current shift and seizurelike event induction in slices. Similarly, intracerebroventricular injection of NOX antagonists prevented acutely induced seizures in rats. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that seizures are initiated by NMDA receptor-mediated NOX-induced oxidative stress and can be arrested by NOX inhibition. We introduce a novel use for blood-brain barrier-permeable NOX inhibitor with a significant potential to become the first seizure-specific medication. Thus, targeting NOX may provide a breakthrough treatment for focal epilepsies. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:907-920.",

The present study is to evaluate the toxic effects of carbon black nanoparticles, Printex 90, on the neural cell line PC-12. The study revealed that Printex 90 treatment significantly decreased cell viability, accompanied by an enormous increase in reactive oxygen species generation and a decrease in ATP. Additionally, NOX2 and NOX4, 4-hydroxynonenal, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker proteins (IRE-1α, ATF-6, GRP78, PERK and the downstream target protein CHOP) and antioxidative enzymes (glutathione and superoxide dismutase) were evaluated. It showed that Printex 90 significantly upregulated 4-hydroxynonenal, NOX2 and NOX4 expression, and the levels, or activity, of glutathione and superoxide dismutase, were markedly reduced. For the ER stress-associated proteins, Printex 90 induced a significant increase of IRE-1α, ATF-6, GRP78, p-PERK and CHOP expression. Collectively, these results demonstrate that NOX and ER stress are involved in Printex 90-mediated neural damage. Therefore, decreased ER stress and NOX-derived reactive oxygen species generation may provide compensatory protective effects and attenuate Printex 90-induced neural injury.",

Under normal circumstances, reactive oxygen species mediate a number of important cellular functions, including the facilitation of adaptive immunity. In pathogenic circumstances, however, excess reactive oxygen species generated by NOX promotes apoptotic cell death. In ischemic stroke, in particular, it has been shown that both NOX activation and derangements in glucose metabolism result in increased apoptosis. Moreover, recent studies have established that glucose, as a NOX substrate, plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury. Thus, NOX inhibition has the potential to mitigate the deleterious impact of hyperglycemia on stroke. In this paper, we provide an overview of this research, coupled with a discussion of its implications for the development of NOX inhibition as a strategy for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Both inhibition using apocynin, as well as the prospect of developing more specific inhibitors based on what is now understood of the biology of NOX assembly and activation, will be highlighted in the course of our discussion."

METHODS: PLB-985 and X chromosome linked gp91-phox gene knockout (X-CGD) cells were treated with 5, 10, or 20 mM IP6 for 24 to 72 h. Cell growth was assayed using a highly water-soluble tetrazolium salt. The rate of apoptotic and necrotic cell death was determined with an Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide kit. The expression of CD11b as a marker of monocytic property and of LC3 as an autophagy marker was tested, using flow cytometry combined with fluorescent antibodies. RESULTS: Treatment with 5 and 10 mM IP6 for 24 h was found to suppress the growth of both cell lines, though the effect was more dramatic in PLB-985 cells. After 6-h treatment with 20 mM IP6, the necrosis rate of PLB-985 cells was significantly greater than that of X-CGD cells. Further, after 72-h treatment with 10 mM IP6, CD11b expression was observed in PLB-985 cells but inhibited in X-CGD cells. Autophagy monitoring after 6-h treatment with 10 mM IP6 revealed that LC3 expression was suppressed in PLB-985 cells, whereas it was somewhat increased in X-CGD cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that NADPH oxidase activation mediates IP6-induced metabolic disruption associated with necrosis, differentiation, cell growth, and autophagy in PLB-985 cells."

NAD+ plays crucial roles in cancer metabolism, including in cellular signaling, energy production and redox regulation. However, it remains unclear whether NAD(H) pool size (NAD+ and NADH) could be used as biomarker for colon cancer progression. Here, we showed that the NAD(H) pool size and NAD+ /NADH ratio both increased during colorectal cancer (CRC) progression due to activation of the NAD+ salvage pathway mediated by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). The NAMPT expression was upregulated in adenoma and adenocarcinoma tissues from CRC patients. The NADH fluorescence intensity measured by two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) microscopy was consistently increased in CRC cell lines, azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS)-induced CRC tissues and tumor tissues from CRC patients. The increases in the NAD(H) pool inhibited the accumulation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and FK866, a specific inhibitor of NAMPT, treatment decreased the CRC nodule size by increasing ROS levels in AOM/DSS mice. Collectively, our results suggest that NAMPT-mediated upregulation of the NAD(H) pool protects cancer cells against detrimental oxidative stress and that detecting NADH fluorescence by TPEF microscopy could be a potential method for monitoring CRC progression.",

      "abstract": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a universal electron carrier that participates in important intracellular metabolic reactions and signaling events. Interestingly, emerging evidence in animals indicates that cellular NAD can be actively or passively released into the extracellular space, where it is processed or perceived by ectoenzymes or cell-surface receptors. We have recently shown in Arabidopsis thaliana that exogenous NAD induces defense responses, that pathogen infection leads to release of NAD into the extracellular space at concentrations sufficient for defense activation, and that depletion of extracellular NAD (eNAD) by transgenic expression of the human NAD-hydrolyzing ectoenzyme CD38 inhibits plant immunity. We therefore hypothesize that, during plant-microbe interactions, NAD is released from dead or dying cells into the extracellular space where it interacts with adjacent naïve cells' surface receptors, which in turn activate downstream immune signaling. However, it is currently unknown whether eNAD signaling is unique to Arabidopsis or the Brassicaceae family. In this study, we treated citrus plants with exogenous NAD+ and tested NAD+-induced transcriptional changes and disease resistance. Our results show that NAD+ induces profound transcriptome changes and strong resistance to citrus canker, a serious citrus disease caused by the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc). Furthermore, NAD+-induced resistance persists in new flushes emerging after removal of the tissues previously treated with NAD+. Finally, NAD+ treatment primes citrus tissues, resulting in a faster and stronger induction of multiple salicylic acid pathway genes upon subsequent Xcc infection. Taken together, these results indicate that exogenous NAD+ is able to induce immune responses in citrus and suggest that eNAD may also be an elicitor in this woody plant species."

      "abstract": "Previous studies found that reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) protected neurons against ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury. In addition to ROS reduction and ATP increment, preliminary data suggested that NADPH inhibited ADP and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. As the effect of NADPH on platelet function was not reported by other investigators, the actions of NADPH on platelet function and mechanisms of actions were investigated in the present study. In vitro studies, the effects of different concentrations of NADPH on platelet aggregation induced by ADP (10 μM), thrombin (0.05 U/mL) or AA (50 μM) were determined. The results showed that NADPH could inhibit platelet aggregation induced by ADP, thrombin or AA in a concentration dependent manner. When the inhibitory effects of NAD+, NADH, NADP+ and NADPH on platelet aggregation were compared, NADPH demonstrated the relatively best effect on platelet aggregation. In vivo studies, the effects of NADPH on platelet aggregation, tail bleeding time, coagulation response and ferric chloride-induced thrombosis were determined in mice or rats. The maximum aggregation rate of platelets of rats injected with NADPH (5 mg/kg) was lower than platelets from control rats. NADPH transiently prolonged tail bleeding time in mice at 30 min after the injection of NADPH (7.5 mg/kg), while aspirin (15 mg/kg) significantly prolonged the tail bleeding time in mice at all time points examined. NADPH (5 mg/kg), as well as aspirin (10 mg/kg), had no effect on coagulation response in rats. Using a FeCl3-induced abdominal aorta injury thrombosis model, administration of NADPH (5 mg/kg) significantly delayed the onset of vessel occlusion, while aspirin (10 mg/kg) almost completely prevented the vessel occlusion. With microscopic examination the thrombi in injured vessel sections of rats received NADPH were much smaller and less dense than that of rats received vehicle treatment. ADP induced an increase in phosphorylation of p38 and the effect was markedly inhibited by the p38 inhibitor SB203580. Similarly, NADPH also inhibited ADP-induced phosphorylation of p38. Similar to NADPH, SB203580 robustly inhibited ADP- and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. In addition, NADPH also reduced ADP-induced increases in ROS in platelets. The current results demonstrated that NADPH inhibited platelet aggregation, oxidative stress and p38 phosphorylation, suggesting that NADPH might be a novel compound for management of high risk of cardiovascular disease.",

There is currently no specific therapy available for patients that target the molecular pathophysiology of LMNA cardiomyopathy. Recent studies suggested that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) cellular content could be a critical determinant for heart function. Biosynthesis of NAD+ from vitamin B3 (known as salvage pathways) is the primary source of NAD+. We showed here that NAD+ salvage pathway was altered in the heart of mouse and human carrying LMNA mutation, leading to an alteration of one of NAD+ co-substrate enzymes, PARP-1. Oral administration of nicotinamide riboside, a natural NAD+ precursor and a pyridine-nucleoside form of vitamin B3, leads to a marked improvement of the NAD+ cellular content, an increase of PARylation of cardiac proteins and an improvement of left ventricular structure and function in a model of LMNA cardiomyopathy. Collectively, our results provide mechanistic and therapeutic insights into dilated cardiomyopathy caused by LMNA mutations.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a common consequence of acute kidney injury. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which is derived from the pentose phosphate pathway, is essential for the proper functioning of essential redox and antioxidant defense systems. Previous studies have indicated that NADPH is responsible for protecting the brain from ischemic injury. The goal of this study was to analyze the protective function of NADPH in renal IRI. METHODS: The IRI animal model was generated through a midline laparotomy surgery that clamped both sides of the renal pedicles for 40 min to induce renal ischemia. The in vitro model was generated by removing oxygen and glucose from human kidney epithelial cells (HK-2 cells), followed by reoxygenation to imitate IRI. Renal function and histopathological changes were observed and evaluated. Additionally, malondialdehyde and glutathione levels were determined in renal tissue homogenate as indicators of oxidative stress. ROS production in cells was determined by DHE staining. Protein biomarker expression was evaluated by western blot, apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL staining, and p65 nuclear translocation was visualized by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Our data indicated that NADPH safeguarded the kidneys from histological and functional damage, and significantly reduce cell injury along with preventing potential increases in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Furthermore, we observed that NADPH increased glutathione levels, while reducing levels of malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species. Additionally, our results suggested that NADPH treatment may alleviate IRI-induced apoptosis and inflammation. CONCLUSION: NADPH treatment may protect against renal IRI and should be further developed as a new treatment for acute kidney injury.",

Angiotensin (Ang) II has been reported to aggravate smoking-induced lung fibrosis, whereas the effect of Ang-(1-7) on smoking-related lung fibrosis remains unknown. The autophagy, being activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), is identified as a novel mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis. However, whether autophagy is involved in regulation of smoking-induced lung fibrosis still needs investigation. Here, we aim to investigate the effect of Ang-(1-7) on smoking-related lung fibrosis by the regulation of autophagy and ROS. In vivo, Ang-(1-7) was constantly infused into passive smoking rats for 8 weeks. In vitro, primary lung fibroblasts were pretreated with antioxidant, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced oxidase (NOX) 4 siRNA, or light chain (LC) 3B siRNA before exposure to cigarette smoke extract (CSE). GFP-mCherry red fluorescent protein-LC3 advenovirus was introduced to evaluate the autophagic flux in cells. We found that Ang-(1-7) reduced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration, protein levels of NOX4, and autophagy impairment, as well as improving lung fibrosis induced by smoking stimulation in vivo. In vitro, CSE treatment elevated NOX4 protein expression and ROS production, resulting in the accumulation of impaired autophagosomes in fibroblasts. LC3B depletion enhanced CSE-induced collagen synthesis. Treatment with antioxidants or NOX4 siRNA inhibited CSE-induced insufficient autophagic flux and collagen production. In contrast, the action of Ang-(1-7) opposed the effects of CSE. In conclusion, Ang-(1-7) improves smoking-induced pulmonary fibrosis via attenuating the impaired autophagy caused by NOX4-dependent ROS in vivo and in vitro.",

      "abstract": "Significance: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an essential pyridine nucleotide that serves as an essential cofactor and substrate for a number of critical cellular processes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, DNA repair, epigenetically modulated gene expression, intracellular calcium signaling, and immunological functions. NAD+ depletion may occur in response to either excessive DNA damage due to free radical or ultraviolet attack, resulting in significant poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation and a high turnover and subsequent depletion of NAD+, and/or chronic immune activation and inflammatory cytokine production resulting in accelerated CD38 activity and decline in NAD+ levels. Recent studies have shown that enhancing NAD+ levels can profoundly reduce oxidative cell damage in catabolic tissue, including the brain. Therefore, promotion of intracellular NAD+ anabolism represents a promising therapeutic strategy for age-associated degenerative diseases in general, and is essential to the effective realization of multiple benefits of healthy sirtuin activity. The kynurenine pathway represents the de novo NAD+ synthesis pathway in mammalian cells. NAD+ can also be produced by the NAD+ salvage pathway. Recent Advances: In this review, we describe and discuss recent insights regarding the efficacy and benefits of the NAD+ precursors, nicotinamide (NAM), nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide riboside (NR), and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), in attenuating NAD+ decline in degenerative disease states and physiological aging. Critical Issues: Results obtained in recent years have shown that NAD+ precursors can play important protective roles in several diseases. However, in some cases, these precursors may vary in their ability to enhance NAD+ synthesis via their location in the NAD+ anabolic pathway. Increased synthesis of NAD+ promotes protective cell responses, further demonstrating that NAD+ is a regulatory molecule associated with several biochemical pathways. Future Directions: In the next few years, the refinement of personalized therapy for the use of NAD+ precursors and improved detection methodologies allowing the administration of specific NAD+ precursors in the context of patients' NAD+ levels will lead to a better understanding of the therapeutic role of NAD+ precursors in human diseases.",

Zingerone is a stable active component derived from dry ginger rhizome. We investigated the effect of zingerone on diabetic nephropathy and explored the possible mechanisms. We showed that zingerone decreased the levels of serum insulin, C-peptide and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c. The levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, urinary albumin content and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) were reduced by zingerone. Moreover, zingerone attenuated the pathological injuries of kidneys, reduced the surface area of Bowman's capsule, Bowman's space, glomerular tuft, and decreased the expression of collagen IV and fibronectin in kidneys in db/db mice. The high levels of triglyceride and cholesterol, and high expression of TNFɑ and IL-6 were decreased by zingerone. Furthermore, zingerone decreased the level of MDA and increased the content of glutathione (GSH). NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) expression was significantly increased in kidneys of db/db mice and in HK-2 cells after exposure to high glucose. Zingerone significantly decreased the expression of NOX4 in vivo and in vitro. Upregualtion of NOX4 significantly inhibited zingerone-induced protective effects against the cytotoxicity of high glucose. Downregulation of NOX4 was responsible for zingerone-exhibited pharmacological activities and reduction of diabetic nephropathy. Overall, zingerone is a promising therapeutic treatment to attenuate diabetic nephropathy.",

Mice were randomly assigned to four main groups (n=48 per group): Experimental group (BetA), positive control group (goniothalamin), vehicle control group (dimethyl sulfoxide) and control group (without vehicle). Each group was further divided into three equal subgroups according to the treatment length (4, 8 and 12 days). BetA treatment induced the expression of NADPH‑d activity in the thymus and spleen without any significant changes in the morphology of the organs. Furthermore, the expression pattern of NADPH‑d in BetA‑treated animals was significantly increased compared with that in the control animals. NADPH‑d expression in the thymus and spleen suggests that NO signaling may be a potential mechanism underlying the BetA‑induced immunomodulation in these organs.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current review discusses the biology and metabolism of the essential pyridine nucleotide nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in the central nervous system. We also review recent work suggesting important neuroprotective effects that may be associated with the promotion of NAD+ levels through NAD+ precursors against Alzheimer's disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Perturbations in the physiological homoeostatic state of the brain during the ageing process can lead to impaired cellular function, and ultimately leads to loss of brain integrity and accelerates cognitive and memory decline. Increased oxidative stress has been shown to impair normal cellular bioenergetics and enhance the depletion of the essential nucleotides NAD+ and ATP. NAD+ and its precursors have been shown to improve cellular homoeostasis based on association with dietary requirements, and treatment and management of several inflammatory and metabolic diseases in vivo. Cellular NAD+ pools have been shown to be reduced in the ageing brain, and treatment with NAD+ precursors has been hypothesized to restore these levels and attenuate disruption in cellular bioenergetics. SUMMARY: NAD+ and its precursors may represent an important therapeutic strategy to maintain optimal cellular homoeostatic functions in the brain. NAD+ precursors are available in a variety of foods and may be translated to the clinic in the form of supplements.",

      "abstract": "The pathophysiologic mechanisms of epileptogenesis are poorly understood, and no effective therapy exists for suppressing epileptogenesis. Numerous reports have shown that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) has neuroprotective effects, suggesting its potential use for treating epileptogenesis. Here we evaluated the effects of NAD+ on epileptogenesis and the mechanisms underlying these effects. In pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) model mice, NAD+ was injected three times within 24.5 h after SE. NAD+ intervention significantly reduced the incidence of spontaneous recurrent seizure (SRS) and abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) activity, rescued contextual fear memory formation, reduced neuronal loss in the CA1 region of the hippocampus at SRS stage. Furthermore, exogenous supply of NAD+ distinctly reversed the seizure-induced depletion of endogenous NAD+, reduced neuronal apoptosis in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, and reversed the augmented Acp53/p53 ratio at the early stage of epileptogenesis. Our findings demonstrated that early-stage intervention with NAD+ prevents epileptogenesis in pilocarpine-induced SE mice by suppressing neuronal apoptosis.",

      "abstract": "SIGNIFICANCE: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) participates in redox reactions and NAD+-dependent signaling processes, which involve the cleavage of NAD+ coupled to posttranslational modifications of proteins or the production of second messengers. Either as a primary cause or as a secondary component of the pathogenic process, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are prominent features of several neurodegenerative diseases. Activation of NAD+-dependent signaling pathways has a major effect in the capacity of the cell to modulate mitochondrial function and counteract the deleterious effects of increased oxidative stress. Recent Advances: Progress in the understanding of the biological functions and compartmentalization of NAD+-synthesizing and NAD+-consuming enzymes have led to the emergence of NAD+ metabolism as a major therapeutic target for age-related diseases. CRITICAL ISSUES: Three distinct families of enzymes consume NAD+ as substrate: poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), ADP-ribosyl cyclases (CD38/CD157) and sirtuins. Two main strategies to increase NAD+ availability have arisen. These strategies are based on the utilization of NAD+ intermediates/precursors or the inhibition of the NAD+-consuming enzymes, PARPs and CD38. An increase in endogenous sirtuin activity seems to mediate the protective effect that enhancing NAD+ availability confers in several models of neurodegeneration and age-related diseases. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: A growing body of evidence suggests the beneficial role of enhancing NAD+ availability in models of neurodegeneration. The challenge ahead is to establish the value and safety of the long-term use of these strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 28, 1652-1668.",

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that increased nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) expression is associated with the development and prognosis of many cancers, but it remains unknown regarding its role in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In the present study, the results from tissue microarray showed that NAMPT was overexpressed in OSCC patients and its expression level was directly correlated with differential grades of cancer. Interestingly, treatment of OSCC cells with chemotherapy agent arsenic trioxide (ATO) decreased the levels of NAMPT protein and increased cellular death in an ATO dose- and time-dependent manner. Most importantly, combination of low concentration ATO with FK866 (a NAMPT inhibitor) exerted enhanced inhibitive effect on NAMPT protein and mRNA expressions, leading to synergistic cytotoxicity on cancer cells through increasing cell apoptosis and depleting intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels. These findings demonstrate the crucial role of NAMPT in the prognosis of OSCC and reveal inhibition of NAMPT as a novel mechanism of ATO in suppressing cancer cell growth. Our results suggest that ATO can significantly enhance therapeutic efficacy of NAMPT inhibitor, and combined treatment may be a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for OSCC patients.",

We used a spinal cord ischemia injury (SCII) model in rats to verify our hypothesis that NAD+ could ameliorate oxidative stress-induced neuronal apoptosis. Adult male rats were subjected to transient spinal cord ischemia for 60min, and different doses of NAD+ were administered intraperitoneally immediately after the start of reperfusion. Neurological function was determined by Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) scores. The oxidative stress level was assessed by superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. The degree of apoptosis was analyzed by deoxyuridinetriphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining and protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 and AIF (apoptosis inducing factor). The results showed that NAD+ at 50 or 100mg/kg significantly decreased the oxidative stress level and neuronal apoptosis in the spinal cord of ischemia-reperfusion rats compared with saline, as accompanied with the decreased oxidative stress, NAD+ administration significantly restrained the neuronal apoptosis after ischemia injury while improved the neurological and motor function. These findings suggested that NAD+ might protect against spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion via reducing oxidative stress-induced neuronal apoptosis.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco smoke (TS) causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, including chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. Rtp801, an inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin, is induced by oxidative stress triggered by TS. Its up-regulation drives lung susceptibility to TS injury by enhancing inflammation and alveolar destruction. We postulated that Rtp801 is not only increased by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in TS but also instrumental in creating a feedforward process leading to amplification of endogenous ROS generation. We used cigarette smoke extract (CSE) to model the effect of TS in wild-type (Wt) and knockout (KO-Rtp801) mouse lung fibroblasts (MLF). The production of superoxide anion in KO-Rtp801 MLF was lower than that in Rtp801 Wt cells after CSE treatment, and it was inhibited in Wt MLF by silencing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase-4 (Nox4) expression with small interfering Nox4 RNA. We observed a cytoplasmic location of ROS formation by real-time redox changes using reduction-oxidation-sensitive green fluorescent protein profluorescent probes. Both the superoxide production and the increase in the cytoplasmic redox were inhibited by apocynin. Reduction in the activity of Sod and decreases in the expression of Sod2 and Gpx1 genes were associated with Rtp801 CSE induction. The ROS produced by Nox4 in conjunction with the decrease in cellular antioxidant enzymatic defenses may account for the observed cytoplasmic redox changes and cellular damage caused by TS.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) is a subtype of nAChR and has been reported to be involved in hypertension end-organ damage. In this study, we tested the role of α7nAChR in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced senescence of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). APPROACH AND RESULTS: Expression of α7nAChR was not influenced by Ang II. Ang II induced remarkable senescent phenotypes in rodent and human VSMCs, including increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, phosphorylation of H2A.X(Ser139), phosphorylation of Chk1(Ser317), reduced replication, and downregulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Activation of α7nAChR with a selective agonist PNU-282987 blocked Ang II-induced senescence in cultured VSMCs. Moreover, PNU-282987 treatment attenuated the Ang II infusion-induced VSMC senescence in wild-type but not in α7nAChR(-/-) mice. PNU-282987 reduced the Ang II-enhanced reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and the expression of NADPH oxidase 1, NADPH oxidase 4, and p22(phox) in cultured VSMCs isolated from wild-type but not in α7nAChR(-/-) mice. Furthermore, PNU-282987 diminished Ang II-induced prosenescence signaling pathways, including p53, acetyl-p53, p21, and p16(INK4a). Finally, although α7nAChR activation by PNU-282987 did not affect the Ang II-induced downregulation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), it significantly increased intracellular NAD(+) levels, and thereby enhanced SIRT1 activity in an AMP-dependent protein kinase-independent manner. Depletion of SIRT1 by knockdown or SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 abrogated the antisenescence effect of α7nAChR against Ang II. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that activation of α7nAChR alleviates Ang II-induced VSMC senescence through promoting NAD(+)-SIRT1 pathway, suggesting that α7nAChR may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Ang II-associated vascular aging disorders.",

Pretreatment conditions were optimized by Doehlert experiment, varying NaCl concentration, temperature, yeast density and time. After the optimization, the riboflavin concentration in the residual yeast lysate (RYL) was 46% higher than the one present in commercial yeast extract. Moreover, similar NAD concentration was observed in both extracts. Subsequently, two decolorization experiments were performed, that is, a batch experiment (48 h) and a kinetic experiment (102 h). The results of the batch experiment showed that the use of the RYL produced by the optimized method increased decolorization rates and led to color removal efficiencies similar to those found when using the commercial extract (∼80%) and from 23% to 50% higher when compared to the control (without redox mediators). Kinetics analysis showed that methane production was also higher in the presence of yeast extract and RYL, and biogas was mostly generated after stabilization of color removal. In all kinetics experiments the azo dye degradation followed the pseudo-second-order model, which suggested that there was a concomitant adsorption/degradation of the dye on the biomass cell surface. Therefore, results showed the possibility of applying the pretreated residual yeast to improve color removal under anaerobic conditions, which is a sustainable process.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Isoniazid (INH) is one of the effective antituberculosis (TB) drugs used for TB treatment. However, most of the drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) clinical strains are resistant to INH, a first-line antituberculous drug. Certain metabolic enzymes such as adenosylhomocysteinase (Rv3248c), universal stress protein (Rv2623), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced)-dependent enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (Rv1484), oxidoreductase (Rv2971), dihydrofolate reductase (Rv2763c), pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (Rv1187) have been identified to bind INH-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (INH-NAD) and INH-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate adducts coupled to Sepharose resin. These enzymes are reported to be involved in many important biochemical processes of MTB, including cysteine and methionine metabolism, mycobacterial growth regulation, mycolic acid biosynthesis, detoxification of toxic metabolites, folate biosynthesis, etc. The truncated INH-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized) adduct, 4-isonicotinoylnicotinamide, isolated from urine samples of human TB patients treated with INH therapy is proposed to have antimycobacterial activity. METHODS: To understand the mechanism of interaction of the truncated INH-NAD adduct, binding energy studies were carried out on the aforementioned six enzymes with known three-dimensional structures using AutoDock4.2. RESULTS: In silico docking analysis of these MTB enzymes with the truncated INH-NAD adduct showed favorable binding interactions with docking energies ranging from -5.29 to -7.07 kcal/mol. CONCLUSION: Thus, in silico docking study revealed that the INH-NAD adduct, which is generated in vivo after INH activation, may undergo spontaneous hydrolysis to form the truncated INH-NAD adduct and further binds and inhibits multiple enzymes of MTB, in addition to InhA, confirming that INH is an effective anti-TB drug acting at multiple enzymes. Further analysis of amino acid residues in the active site of INH-NAD-binding proteins showed the probable presence of catalytic triad in four enzymes possibly involved in INH binding to the enzyme.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our previous study has defined a role of TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator in neuroprotection against ischemic injury through increasing the flow of pentose phosphate pathway. We hypothesized that the pentose phosphate pathway product nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) could be a novel drug for treatment of ischemic stroke. METHODS: The NADPH was given before, at the onset, or after stroke onset with single or repeated intravenous (mice and rats) or intraperitoneal injections (monkey). The short- and long-term therapeutic effects of NADPH were evaluated in male adult ICR mice (total=614) with transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, in male adult Sprague-Dawley rats (total=114) with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, and in male adult rhesus monkey (total=12) with thrombotic middle cerebral artery occlusion. RESULTS: Administration of NADPH led to a dramatic increase in the levels of ATP and reduced form of glutathione, whereas it decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species. NADPH significantly reduced infarct volume, improved poststroke survival, and recovery of neurological functions in mouse and rat models of stroke. Robust neuroprotection of a single dose of NADPH was seen when it was administered within 5 hours after reperfusion; however, repeat administration of NADPH twice a day for 7 days starting 24 hours after the onset of stroke also offered therapeutic effects. Pretreatment with NADPH also significantly improved the outcome of stroke insult. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of exogenous NADPH significantly protected neurons against ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury in 2 rodent stroke models. Thus, NADPH might be a promising drug candidate for treatment of ischemic stroke.",

Oxidative stress is an important secondary mechanism of injury that can lead to neuronal apoptosis and subsequent behavioral changes. Using a clinically relevant and validated rodent blast model, we investigated how nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (Nox) expression and associated oxidative stress contribute to cellular apoptosis after single and repeat blast injuries. Nox4 forms a complex with p22phox after injury, forming free radicals at neuronal membranes. Using immunohistochemical-staining methods, we found a visible increase in Nox4 after single blast injury in Sprague Dawley rats. Interestingly, Nox4 was also increased in postmortem human samples obtained from athletes diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Nox4 activity correlated with an increase in superoxide formation. Alpha-lipoic acid, an oxidative stress inhibitor, prevented the development of superoxide acutely and increased antiapoptotic markers B-cell lymphoma 2 (t = 3.079, P < 0.05) and heme oxygenase 1 (t = 8.169, P < 0.001) after single blast. Subacutely, alpha-lipoic acid treatment reduced proapoptotic markers Bax (t = 4.483, P < 0.05), caspase 12 (t = 6.157, P < 0.001), and caspase 3 (t = 4.573, P < 0.01) after repetitive blast, and reduced tau hyperphosphorylation indicated by decreased CP-13 and paired helical filament staining. Alpha-lipoic acid ameliorated impulsive-like behavior 7 days after repetitive blast injury (t = 3.573, P < 0.05) compared with blast exposed animals without treatment. TBI can cause debilitating symptoms and psychiatric disorders. Oxidative stress is an ideal target for neuropharmacologic intervention, and alpha-lipoic acid warrants further investigation as a therapeutic for prevention of chronic neurodegeneration.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: With no approved pharmacological treatment, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the most common cause of chronic liver disease in Western countries and its worldwide prevalence continues to increase along with the growing obesity epidemic. Here, we show that a high-fat high-sucrose (HFHS) diet, eliciting chronic hepatosteatosis resembling human fatty liver, lowers hepatic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+) ) levels driving reductions in hepatic mitochondrial content, function, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, in conjunction with robust increases in hepatic weight, lipid content, and peroxidation in C57BL/6J mice. To assess the effect of NAD(+) repletion on the development of steatosis in mice, nicotinamide riboside, a precursor of NAD(+) biosynthesis, was added to the HFHS diet, either as a preventive strategy or as a therapeutic intervention. We demonstrate that NR prevents and reverts NAFLD by inducing a sirtuin (SIRT)1- and SIRT3-dependent mitochondrial unfolded protein response, triggering an adaptive mitohormetic pathway to increase hepatic β-oxidation and mitochondrial complex content and activity. The cell-autonomous beneficial component of NR treatment was revealed in liver-specific Sirt1 knockout mice (Sirt1(hep-/-) ), whereas apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (Apoe(-/-) ) challenged with a high-fat high-cholesterol diet affirmed the use of NR in other independent models of NAFLD. CONCLUSION: Our data warrant the future evaluation of NAD(+) boosting strategies to manage the development or progression of NAFLD.",

Whether hypomethylation of the D‑loop region is involved in the regulation of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide subunit 2 (ND‑2) expressions in colorectal cancer has remained elusive. In the present study, the association between methylation status of the D‑loop region, mtDNA copy number and ND‑2 expression was investigated in 65 colorectal cancer specimens and their corresponding non‑cancerous tissues. In addition, a de‑methylation experiment was performed on the Caco‑2 colorectal cancer cell line by using 5‑aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5‑Aza). The methylation rate of the D‑loop region in all 65 colorectal cancer tissues was markedly reduced when compared with that of their corresponding non‑cancerous tissues (13.8 vs. 81.5%; P<0.05). Furthermore, the methylation rate of the D‑loop region in colorectal cancer tissues was markedly decreased in clinicopathological stages III and IV compared with that in clinicopathological stages I and II (7.1 and 0% vs. 25 and 16%; P<0.05). In addition, the mean relative mtDNA copy number and ND‑2 expression in colorectal cancer tissues were increased compared with those in the corresponding non‑cancerous tissues. De‑methylation of the D‑loop region was associated with an elevated mtDNA copy number and an increased ND‑2 expression. Furthermore, the mtDNA copy number and ND‑2 expression in Caco‑2 cells were significantly increased after 5‑Aza treatment. In conclusion, de‑methylation of the D‑loop region is likely to be involved in the regulation of the mtDNA copy number and ND-2 expression.",

To elucidate the effects of rue on main drug-metabolizing enzymes, effects of an aqueous extract of the aerial part of rue and its ingredients on cytochrome P450 (P450/CYP), uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H):quinone oxidoreductase were studied in C57BL/6JNarl mice. Oral administration of rue extract to males increased hepatic Cyp1a and Cyp2b activities in a dose-dependent manner. Under a 7-day treatment regimen, rue extract (0.5 g/kg) induced hepatic Cyp1a and Cyp2b activities and protein levels in males and females. This treatment increased hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity only in males. However, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase activity remained unchanged. Based on the contents of rutin and furanocoumarins of mouse dose of rue extract, rutin increased hepatic Cyp1a activity and the mixture of furanocoumarins (Fmix) increased Cyp2b activities in males. The mixture of rutin and Fmix increased Cyp1a and Cyp2b activities. These results revealed that rutin and Fmix contributed at least in part to the P450 induction by rue."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ischaemic heart disease can lead to serious, life-threatening complications. Traditional therapies for ischaemia aim to increase oxygen delivery and reduce the myocardial ATP consumption by increasing the coronary perfusion and by suppressing cardiac contractility, heart rate or blood pressure. An adjunctive treatment option for ischaemia is to improve or optimize myocardial metabolism. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Metabolic suppression in the ischaemic heart is characterized by reduced levels of high-energy molecules: ATP and NAD(+) . Because NAD(+) is required for most metabolic processes that generate ATP, we hypothesized that restoration of NAD(+) would be a prerequisite for ATP regeneration and examined the role of the major NAD(+) anabolic and catabolic pathways in the bioenergetic restoration process following oxygen-glucose deprivation injury in a cardiomyocyte cell line (H9c2 cells). KEY RESULTS: Salvage of NAD(+) via nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase was essential for bioenergetic recovery in cardiomyocytes. Blockade of nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase prevented the restoration of the cellular ATP pool following oxygen-glucose deprivation injury by inhibiting both the aerobic and anaerobic metabolism in the cardiomyocytes. NAD(+) consumption by PARP-1 also undermined the recovery processes, and PARP inhibition significantly improved the metabolism and increased cellular ATP levels in cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We conclude that the NAD(+) salvage pathway is essential for bioenergetic recovery in post-hypoxic cardiomyocytes and PARP inhibition may represent a potential future therapeutic intervention in ischaemic heart disease.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a complex condition, characterized by severe disabling fatigue with no known cause, no established diagnostic tests, and no universally effective treatment. Several studies have proposed symptomatic treatment with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) supplementation. The primary endpoint was to assess the effect of CoQ10 plus NADH supplementation on age-predicted maximum heart rate (max HR) during a cycle ergometer test. Secondary measures included fatigue, pain and sleep. METHODS: A proof-of-concept, 8-week, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial was conducted in 80 CFS patients assigned to receive either CoQ10 plus NADH supplementation or matching placebo twice daily. Maximum HR was evaluated at baseline and at end of the run-in period using an exercise test. Fatigue, pain and sleep were evaluated at baseline, and then reassessed at 4- and 8-weeks through self-reported questionnaires. RESULTS: The CoQ10 plus NADH group showed a significant reduction in max HR during a cycle ergometer test at week 8 versus baseline (P = 0.022). Perception of fatigue also showed a decrease through all follow-up visits in active group versus placebo (P = 0.03). However, pain and sleep did not improve in the active group. Coenzyme Q10 plus NADH was generally safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that CoQ10 plus NADH supplementation for 8 weeks is safe and potentially effective in reducing max HR during a cycle ergometer test and also on fatigue in CFS. Further additional larger controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings. Clinical trial registrationThis trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02063126.",

      "abstract": "Ototoxicity is an important issue in patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy. Numerous studies have demonstrated that several mechanisms, including oxidative stress, DNA damage, and inflammatory responses, are closely associated with cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. Although much attention has been directed at identifying ways to protect the inner ear from cisplatin-induced damage, the precise underlying mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. The cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) has emerged as an important regulator of cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis. NAD(+) acts as a cofactor for various enzymes including sirtuins (SIRTs) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), and therefore, maintaining adequate NAD(+) levels has therapeutic benefits because of its effect on NAD(+)-dependent enzymes. Recent studies demonstrated that disturbance in intracellular NAD(+) levels is critically involved in cisplatin-induced cochlear damage associated with oxidative stress, DNA damage, and inflammatory responses. In this review, we describe the importance of NAD(+) in cisplatin-induced ototoxicity and discuss potential strategies for the prevention or treatment of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity with a particular focus on NAD(+)-dependent cellular pathways.",

However, little is known about the sources of ROS in hepatocytes or their role in disease progression. We studied the effects of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced oxidase 4 (NOX4) in liver tissues from patients with NASH and mice with steatohepatitis. METHODS: Liver biopsy samples were obtained from 5 patients with NASH, as well as 4 patients with simple steatosis and 5 patients without steatosis (controls) from the University of California, Davis Cancer Center Biorepository. Mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of NOX4 (NOX4(hepKO)) and NOX4(floxp+/+) C57BL/6 mice (controls) were given fast-food diets (supplemented with high-fructose corn syrup) or choline-deficient l-amino acid defined diets to induce steatohepatitis, or control diets, for 20 weeks. A separate group of mice were given the NOX4 inhibitor (GKT137831). Liver tissues were collected and immunoblot analyses were performed determine levels of NOX4, markers of inflammation and fibrosis, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase, and phospho-eIF-2α kinase-mediated stress signaling pathways. We performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies and immunoprecipitation analyses to determine the oxidation and phosphatase activity of PP1C. RESULTS: Levels of NOX4 were increased in patients with NASH compared with controls. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of NOX4 reduced oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and liver fibrosis in mice with diet-induced steatohepatitis. A small molecule inhibitor of NOX4 reduced liver inflammation and fibrosis and increased insulin sensitivity in mice with diet-induced steatohepatitis. In primary hepatocytes, NOX4 reduced the activity of the phosphatase PP1C, prolonging activation of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mediated stress signaling. Mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of NOX4 and mice given GKT137831 had increased insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: NOX4 regulates oxidative stress in the liver and its levels are increased in patients with NASH and mice with diet-induced steatohepatitis. Inhibitors of NOX4 reduce liver inflammation and fibrosis and increase insulin sensitivity, and might be developed for treatment of NASH.",

However, to elicit efficacious therapies exploiting NADPH-biogenic pathways, it is crucial to understand and specifically define the roles of NADPH-biogenesis pathways used by cancer cells for survival or recovery from cell stress. It is equally important to select NADPH-biogenic pathways that are expendable or not utilized in normal tissue to avoid unwanted toxicity. Here, we address recent literature that demonstrates specific tumor-selective NADPH-biogenesis pathways that can be exploited using agents that target specific cancer cell pathways normally not utilized in normal cells. Defining NADPH-biogenesis profiles of specific cancer-types should enable novel strategies to exploit these therapeutic windows for increased efficacy against recalcitrant neoplastic disease, such as pancreatic cancers. Accomplishing the goal of using ROS as a weapon against cancer cells will also require agents, such as NQO1 bioactivatable drugs, that selectively induce elevated ROS levels in cancer cells, while normal cells are protected."
