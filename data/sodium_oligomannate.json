      "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the therapeutic effect of sodium oligomannate on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice and its effect on intestinal flora and microglia polarization. Methods: Fifty female C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided by the random number table method into the control group, EAE model group and low-dose, medium-dose and high-dose group of sodium oligomannate with 10 mice each. The EAE model group and each dose group of sodium oligomannate were induced by subcutaneous multi-point injection of MOG35-55 peptide for the EAE model. Mice in the low-dose, medium-dose and high-dose group of sodium oligomannate were gavaged sodium oligomannate 40, 80, and 160 mg/kg twice a day, respectively, starting from the day after modeling. The intervention continued until the mice were euthanized. Observe the incidence of disease, infiltration of inflammatory cells in spinal cord tissue, and demyelination in each group of mice.. The mice feces were collected and tested for intestinal flora by 16S rRNA sequencing. Immunofluorescence staining was used to observe the expression of Iba-1 protein, an activation indicator of microglia, in spinal cord tissue. The protein levels of M1 type markers iNOS, CD16, and M2 type markers Arg1 and CD206 were tsested in the spinal cord by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. Results: None of the mice in the control group developed any disease, while the mice in other groups showed varying degrees of disease, including tail sag, unstable walking, and hind limb weakness. Compared with the EAE model group, the incubation period was prolonged, the peak was delayed and the peak neurological dysfunction score was reduced (3.6±0.6 vs 3.0±0.6, 2.8±0.5, 1.8±0.6, P<0.05) in all sodium oligomannate groups, with milder symptoms at higher doses. The differences in pairwise comparisons between the groups were all statistically significant (all P<0.05). In the control group, no inflammatory cell infiltration or demyelinating changes were observed in spinal cord tissue. In the EAE model group, inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelination changes were evident in the spinal cord tissues at the onset peak. Compared with the EAE model group, inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelination were ameliorated in all sodium oligomannate groups. Compared with the control group, the relative abundance of Bacteroidota decreased and that of Firmicutes increased in the EAE model group. Compared with the EAE model group, the relative abundance of Bacteroidota increased and that of Firmicutes decreased, the ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes increased (0.20±0.05 vs 0.37±0.02,0.61±0.03,0.91±0.08,P<0.01) in the respective dose groups. The difference in pairwise comparison between groups was statistically significant (P<0.01), with greater changes at higher doses. Compared with the control group, the levels of Iba-1、CD16 and iNOS increased, while the levels of Arg-1 and CD206 decreased in the EAE model group. Compared with the EAE model group, the levels of Iba-1、CD16 and iNOS decreased, while the levels of Arg-1 and CD206 increased in all sodium oligomannate groups(P<0.01), with greater changes at higher doses. The difference between groups was statistically significant (P<0.01). Conclusions: Sodium oligomannate has a therapeutic effect on EAE and is dose-dependent. Its mechanism of action may be related toimproving intestinal microecology and the modulation of microglial polarization.",

      "abstract": "Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) and vagal afferent neurons constitute functional sensory units of the gut, which have been implicated in bottom-up modulation of brain functions. Sodium oligomannate (GV-971) has been shown to improve cognitive functions in murine models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and recently approved for the treatment of AD patients in China. In this study, we explored whether activation of the EECs-vagal afferent pathways was involved in the therapeutic effects of GV-971. We found that an enteroendocrine cell line RIN-14B displayed spontaneous calcium oscillations due to TRPA1-mediated calcium entry; perfusion of GV-971 (50, 100 mg/L) concentration-dependently enhanced the calcium oscillations in EECs. In ex vivo murine jejunum preparation, intraluminal infusion of GV-971 (500 mg/L) significantly increased the spontaneous and distension-induced discharge rate of the vagal afferent nerves. In wild-type mice, administration of GV-971 (100 mg· kg-1 ·d-1, i.g. for 7 days) significantly elevated serum serotonin and CCK levels and increased jejunal afferent nerve activity. In 7-month-old APP/PS1 mice, administration of GV-971 for 12 weeks significantly increased jejunal afferent nerve activity and improved the cognitive deficits in behavioral tests. Sweet taste receptor inhibitor Lactisole (0.5 mM) and the TRPA1 channel blocker HC-030031 (10 µM) negated the effects of GV-971 on calcium oscillations in RIN-14B cells as well as on jejunal afferent nerve activity. In APP/PS1 mice, co-administration of Lactisole (30 mg ·kg-1 ·d-1, i.g. for 12 weeks) attenuated the effects of GV-971 on serum serotonin and CCK levels, vagal afferent firing, and cognitive behaviors. We conclude that GV-971 activates sweet taste receptors and TRPA1, either directly or indirectly, to enhance calcium entry in enteroendocrine cells, resulting in increased CCK and 5-HT release and consequent increase of vagal afferent activity. GV-971 might activate the EECs-vagal afferent pathways to modulate cognitive functions.",

A marine-derived oligosaccharide, GV-971, has been reported to alter gut microbiota and alleviate Aβ amyloidosis. In this study, the effects of GV-971 on polycystic ovary syndrome-like mice were explored. Mice were randomly assigned into four groups: control, letrozole, letrozole + GV-971, and control + GV-971. Glucose metabolism in polycystic ovary syndrome-like mice was ameliorated by GV-971, while the reproductive endocrine disorder of polycystic ovary syndrome-like mice was partially reversed. The messenger ribonucleic acid levels of steroidogenic enzymes in ovaries of polycystic ovary syndrome-like mice were improved. GV-971 restored the fertility of polycystic ovary syndrome-like mice and significantly increase the number of litters. Furthermore, GV-971 treatment effectively mitigated abnormal bile acid metabolism. Notably, after GV-971 intervention, gut microbiota alpha-diversity was considerably raised and the relative abundance of Firmicutes was reduced. In conclusion, the hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenemia of polycystic ovary syndrome-like mice were alleviated by GV-971 intervention, which was associated with mitigating bile acid metabolism and modulating gut microbiota.",

      "abstract": "It has recently become well-established that there is a connection between Alzheimer's disease pathology and gut microbiome dysbiosis. We have previously demonstrated that antibiotic-mediated gut microbiota perturbations lead to attenuation of Aβ deposition, phosphorylated tau accumulation, and disease-associated glial cell phenotypes in a sex-dependent manner. In this regard, we were intrigued by the finding that a marine-derived oligosaccharide, GV-971, was reported to alter gut microbiota and reduce Aβ amyloidosis in the 5XFAD mouse model that were treated at a point when Aβ burden was near plateau levels. Utilizing comparable methodologies, but with distinct technical and temporal features, we now report on the impact of GV-971 on gut microbiota, Aβ amyloidosis and microglial phenotypes in the APPPS1-21 model, studies performed at the University of Chicago, and independently in the 5X FAD model, studies performed at Washington University, St. Louis.Methods To comprehensively characterize the effects of GV-971 on the microbiota-microglia-amyloid axis, we conducted two separate investigations at independent institutions. There was no coordination of the experimental design or execution between the two laboratories. Indeed, the two laboratories were not aware of each other's experiments until the studies were completed. Male and female APPPS1-21 mice were treated daily with 40, 80, or 160 mg/kg of GV-971 from 8, when Aβ burden was detectable upto 12 weeks of age when Aβ burden was near maximal levels. In parallel, and to corroborate existing published studies and further investigate sex-related differences, male and female 5XFAD mice were treated daily with 100 mg/kg of GV-971 from 7 to 9 months of age when Aβ burden was near peak levels. Subsequently, the two laboratories independently assessed amyloid-β deposition, metagenomic, and neuroinflammatory profiles. Finally, studies were initiated at the University of Chicago to evaluate the metabolites in cecal tissue from vehicle and GV-971-treated 5XFAD mice.Results These studies showed that independent of the procedural differences (dosage, timing and duration of treatment) between the two laboratories, cerebral amyloidosis was reduced primarily in male mice, independent of strain. We also observed sex-specific microbiota differences following GV-971 treatment. Interestingly, GV-971 significantly altered multiple overlapping bacterial species at both institutions. Moreover, we discovered that GV-971 significantly impacted microbiome metabolism, particularly by elevating amino acid production and influencing the tryptophan pathway. The metagenomics and metabolomics changes correspond with notable reductions in peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine profiles. Furthermore, GV-971 treatment dampened astrocyte and microglia activation, significantly decreasing plaque-associated reactive microglia while concurrently increasing homeostatic microglia only in male mice. Bulk RNAseq analysis unveiled sex-specific changes in cerebral cortex transcriptome profiles, but most importantly, the transcriptome changes in the GV-971-treated male group revealed the involvement of microglia and inflammatory responses.Conclusions In conclusion, these studies demonstrate the connection between the gut microbiome, neuroinflammation, and Alzheimer's disease pathology while highlighting the potential therapeutic effect of GV-971. GV-971 targets the microbiota-microglia-amyloid axis, leading to the lowering of plaque pathology and neuroinflammatory signatures in a sex-dependent manner when given at the onset of Aβ deposition or when given after Aβ deposition is already at higher levels.",

Currently, no effective treatments for CAR-T therapy-related cognitive impairment are available. Here, we present a 22-year-old patient with cognitive impairment who was treated with CAR-T cells as a salvage therapy for Burkitt lymphoma. One month after CAR-T cell infusion, he experienced memory loss that mainly manifested as forgetting recent-onset events. Two months of rehabilitation and hyperbaric oxygen therapy failed to provide clinical improvement. Subsequently, the patient improved with oral oxiracetam for 5 months. However, after 10 months of withdrawal, he showed significantly worse memory decline. Then, he began to take sodium oligomannate (22 February 2021). Follow-up testing at 6 and 12 months revealed maintenance of memory gains with sodium oligomannate alone or in combination with rivastigmine. Our case shows that CAR-T therapy may compromise cognitive function and that sodium oligomannate may have partial efficacy in restoring cognitive performance and activities of daily living. This may provide insights for further applications of sodium oligomannate for neurological symptoms, especially cognitive deficits following CAR-T cell therapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: New therapies are urgently needed for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sodium oligomannate (GV-971) is a marine-derived oligosaccharide with a novel proposed mechanism of action. The first phase 3 clinical trial of GV-971 has been completed in China. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in participants with mild-to-moderate AD to assess GV-971 efficacy and safety. Participants were randomized to placebo or GV-971 (900 mg) for 36 weeks. The primary outcome was the drug-placebo difference in change from baseline on the 12-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog12). Secondary endpoints were drug-placebo differences on the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change with caregiver input (CIBIC+), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Safety and tolerability were monitored. RESULTS: A total of 818 participants were randomized: 408 to GV-971 and 410 to placebo. A significant drug-placebo difference on the ADAS-Cog12 favoring GV-971 was present at each measurement time point, measurable at the week 4 visit and continuing throughout the trial. The difference between the groups in change from baseline was - 2.15 points (95% confidence interval, - 3.07 to - 1.23; p < 0.0001; effect size 0.531) after 36 weeks of treatment. Treatment-emergent adverse event incidence was comparable between active treatment and placebo (73.9%, 75.4%). Two deaths determined to be unrelated to drug effects occurred in the GV-971 group. CONCLUSIONS: GV-971 demonstrated significant efficacy in improving cognition with sustained improvement across all observation periods of a 36-week trial. GV-971 was safe and well-tolerated.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sodium oligomannate (GV-971), a marine-derived oligosaccharide, is a novel agent that may improve cognition in AD patients. METHODS: The 24-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo parallel controlled clinical trial was conducted in AD in China between 24 October 2011 and 10 July 2013. The study included a 4-week screening/washout period, followed by a 24-week treatment period. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive GV-971 900 mg, 600 mg, or placebo capsule in treatment period, respectively. The primary outcome was cognitive improvement as assessed by changes in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale 12-item (ADAS-cog12) scores from baseline to week 24. The secondary efficacy outcomes included CIBIC-Plus, ADCS-ADL, and NPI at 24 weeks after treatment compared with baseline. A subgroup study was assessment of the change in cerebral glucose metabolism by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography measurements. RESULTS: Comparing with the placebo group (n = 83, change - 1.45), the ADAS-cog12 score change in the GV-971 600-mg group (n = 76) was - 1.39 (p = 0.89) and the GV-971 900-mg group (n = 83) was - 2.58 (p = 0.30). The treatment responders according to CIBIC-Plus assessment were significantly higher in the GV-971 900-mg group than the placebo group (92.77% vs. 79.52%, p < 0.05). The GV-971 900-mg subgroup showed a lower decline of cerebral metabolic rate for glucose than the placebo subgroup at the left precuneus, right posterior cingulate, bilateral hippocampus, and bilateral inferior orbital frontal at uncorrected p = 0.05. The respective rates of treatment-related AEs were 5.9%, 14.3%, and 3.5%. CONCLUSIONS: GV-971 was safe and well tolerated. GV-971 900 mg was chosen for phase III clinical study.

      "abstract": "Recently, increasing evidence has suggested the association between gut dysbiosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, yet the role of gut microbiota in AD pathogenesis remains obscure. Herein, we provide a potential mechanistic link between gut microbiota dysbiosis and neuroinflammation in AD progression. Using AD mouse models, we discovered that, during AD progression, the alteration of gut microbiota composition leads to the peripheral accumulation of phenylalanine and isoleucine, which stimulates the differentiation and proliferation of pro-inflammatory T helper 1 (Th1) cells. The brain-infiltrated peripheral Th1 immune cells are associated with the M1 microglia activation, contributing to AD-associated neuroinflammation. Importantly, the elevation of phenylalanine and isoleucine concentrations and the increase of Th1 cell frequency in the blood were also observed in two small independent cohorts of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD. Furthermore, GV-971, a sodium oligomannate that has demonstrated solid and consistent cognition improvement in a phase 3 clinical trial in China, suppresses gut dysbiosis and the associated phenylalanine/isoleucine accumulation, harnesses neuroinflammation and reverses the cognition impairment. Together, our findings highlight the role of gut dysbiosis-promoted neuroinflammation in AD progression and suggest a novel strategy for AD therapy by remodelling the gut microbiota.",
