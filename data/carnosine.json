      "abstract": "Carnosine, as a meat constituent, was previously shown to exhibit some pro-oxidative effects during in vitro digestion of a burger meal model in the presence of high (supplemental) level of ascorbic acid (AA). In the current study, effects of dietary carnosine were assessed during in vitro digestion of a burger meal combo model, including intrinsic (low, LCar) and enriched (intermediate, MCar; high, HCar) carnosine in ground pork, with or without dietary levels of AA and/or fructose in simulated beverages. Increased levels of dietary carnosine (MCar and HCar) showed antioxidant activity, irrespective of the digestion phase and the presence of fructose and/or AA. At a dietary level, AA generally acted as an antioxidant, but promoted the formation of glyoxal (GO) in gastric digests and malondialdehyde (MDA) and hexanal in duodenal digests. Fructose generally showed a pro-oxidant effect, but decreased MDA and GO concentrations in both digestion phases. Despite a higher bio-accessible carnosine level measured in HCar, which potentially represents additional health benefits post absorption, MCar treatment provided optimal antioxidant activity during digestion without further effects obtained at the HCar level, showing a ceiling-like effect of dietary carnosine benefits in the digestive environment in vitro. These results demonstrate potential health advantages of increased carnosine in meat during digestion of a meal despite the presence of other redox-active dietary compounds and suggest a potential hormetic effect of carnosine can occur during digestion. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Carnosine, a multifunctional compound naturally present in meat, can bring considerable advantages to meat consumers. Increased dietary levels of carnosine in meat reduced oxidation and the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) during the digestion of a burger meal in the presence of dietary levels of either ascorbic acid (AA) (as an antioxidant) or fructose (as a pro-oxidant). In the context of this study, optimal benefits of carnosine were attained at the intermediate enhancement level, which can be naturally obtained through breeding and nutrition.",

      "abstract": "Therapeutic efficacy of histidyl dipeptides such as carnosine is hampered by circulating carnosinase-1 (CN1), which catalyzes carnosine's hydrolysis and degradation. Prior reports suggest that oral carnosine may improve cardiometabolic parameters in patients with heart failure (HF), but whether CN1 activity is affected by HF is unknown. Here, we measured CN1 content and carnosine degradation rate (CDR) in preoperative plasma samples from a cohort of patients (n = 138) undergoing elective cardiac surgery to determine whether plasma CN1 and/or CDR varied with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. CN1 content was normally distributed in the cohort, but plasma CDR displayed a quasi-bimodal distribution into high- (>2 nmol/(h*μL)) and low-activity (≤2 nmol/(h*μL)) clusters. Multivariable analysis confirmed female sex, diabetes and LV systolic dysfunction was associated with the low-activity CDR cluster. Although CN1 content did not differ, logistic regression analysis revealed that CDR and CN1-specific activity (CDR/CN1 content) was significantly lower in patients with both moderate (ejection fraction, EF ≥ 35 to <50%) and severe LV systolic dysfunction (EF < 35%) compared with patients in the normal range (EF ≥ 50%). These findings suggest that plasma CN1 activity is regulated by factors independent of expression, and that a decline in LV systolic function is associated with low CN1 activity. Further studies are needed to delineate specific mechanisms controlling CN1 expression and activity, which will facilitate the development of carnosine and other histidyl dipeptide therapies for cardiometabolic disorders such as HF.",

      "abstract": "In diabetic kidney disease models, carnosine supplementation ameliorates renal pathology, but its influence in other renal pathologies is less explored. Thus, using the transgenic rat TGRNeph-hAT1 with sex-dependent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, we first tested whether renal expression levels of carnosine system components correlate with disease. Next, we assessed whether carnosine supplementation in male rats improves pathology. In 10-wk-old phenotypically healthy male and female TGRNeph-hAT1 rats, we compared the renal expression of components of the carnosine system by qRT-PCR. Next, male TGRNeph-hAT1 rats were supplemented with carnosine in drinking water for 20 wk. Subsequently, urinary parameters, renal histology, and renal gene expression of renin-angiotensin system components were assessed. Male TGRNeph-hAT1 rats exhibited less renal expression of carnosine synthase 1, oligopeptide transporter 2, and taurine transporter and higher carnosinase 1 expression than female TGRNeph-hAT1 rats at a young age, before disease starts to develop. Male, but not female, TGRNeph-hAT1 rats developed severe albuminuria, glomerular hypertrophy, and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis on aging. Carnosine supplementation ameliorated the glomerular hypertrophy but did not affect albuminuria, renal fibrosis, and podocyte loss. Moreover, carnosine significantly reduced renin and increased angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression within the kidney. Carnosine treatment alleviates glomerular hypertrophy in TGRNeph-hAT1 rats but does not improve other renal pathologies. Although amelioration of glomerular hypertrophy might be explained by changes in renal renin-angiotensin system expression, further studies are warranted to assess causality.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In diabetic kidney disease models, carnosine supplementation ameliorates renal pathology, but its influence in other renal pathologies is less explored. We tested whether renal expression levels of carnosine system components correlate with disease in the model of the transgenic rat TGRNeph-hAT1 with sex-dependent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and whether carnosine supplementation in male rats improves pathology. Our results provide evidence that carnosine feeding affects the glomerular hypertrophy and renal RAS expression.",

METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental study. From March 2019 to February 2022, 126 patients were non-randomly divided into control (n = 63) and intervention (n = 63) groups. The control group received routine treatment such as encephaloside and carnosine, while the intervention group was treated with ligustrazine phosphate tablets and brain glycoside carnosine for 2 weeks. Serum S-100β protein, nerve growth factor (NGF), inflammatory factors [tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and C-reactive protein (CRP)], National Institutes of Health Stroke scale (NIHSS) and and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale were assessed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: After treatment, the level of S-100β in the intervention group was lower, and the level of NGF was significantly higher than in the control group. The levels of TNF-α and CRP in the intervention group were reduced. The NIHSS score of the intervention group was lower, and the ADL score was significantly higher than that of the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of ligustrazine phosphate tablets with cerebroside carnosine can improve neurological function, alleviate inflammation, and enhance the quality of life, worthy of clinical promotion.",

      "abstract": "Nanofibrous dressing materials with an antitumor function can potentially inhibit recurrence of melanoma following the surgical excision of skin tumors. In this study, hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile (hPAN) nanofibers biofunctionalized with L-carnosine (CAR) and loaded with bio (CAR)-synthesized zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles, ZnO/CAR-hPAN (hereafter called ZCPAN), were employed to develop an antimelanoma wound dressing. Inspired by the formulation of the commercial wound healing Zn-CAR complex, i.e., polaprezinc (PLZ), for the first time, we benefitted from the synergy of zinc and CAR to create an antimelanoma nanofibrous wound dressing. According to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, ultrafine ZnO nanoparticles were homogenously distributed throughout the nanofibrous dressing. The ZCPAN nanofiber mat showed a significantly higher toughness (18.7 MJ.m-3 vs. 1.4 MJ.m-3) and an enhanced elongation at break (stretchability) compared to the neat PAN nanofiber mat (12% vs. 9.5%). Additionally, optical coherence elastography (OCE) measurements indicated that the ZCPAN nanofibrous dressing was as stiff as 50.57 ± 8.17 kPa which is notably larger than that of the PAN nanofibrous dressing, i.e., 24.49 ± 6.83 kPa. The optimum mechanical performance of the ZCPAN nanofibers originates from physicochemical interaction of CAR ligands, hPAN nanofibers, and ZnO nanoparticles through hydrogen bonding, electrostatic bonding, and esterification, as verified using ATR-FTIR. An in vitro cell viability assay using human skin melanoma cells implied that the cells are notably killed in the presence of the ZCPAN nanofibers compared to the PAN nanofibers. Thanks to ROS generating ZnO nanoparticles, this behavior originates from the high reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced oxidative damage of melanoma cells, as verified through a CellROX assay. In this regard, an apoptotic cell response to the ZCPAN nanofibers was recorded through an apoptosis assay. Taken together, the ZCPAN nanofibers induce an antimelanoma effect through oxidative stress and thus are a high potential wound dressing material to suppress melanoma regrowth after surgical excision of skin tumors."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss. A critical aspect of AD pathology is represented by oxidative stress, which significantly contributes to neuronal damage and death. Microglia and astrocytes, the primary glial cells in the brain, are crucial for managing oxidative stress and supporting neuronal function. Carnosine is an endogenous dipeptide possessing a multimodal mechanism of action that includes antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-aggregant activities. The present study investigated the effects of Aβ1-42 oligomers (oAβ), small aggregates associated with the neurodegeneration observed in AD, on primary rat mixed glia cultures composed of both microglia and astrocytes, focusing on the ability of these detrimental species to induce oxidative stress. We assessed intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) levels as markers of oxidative stress. Exposure to oAβ significantly elevated both ROS and NO intracellular levels compared to control cells. However, this effect was completely inhibited by the pre-treatment of mixed cultures with carnosine, resulting in ROS and NO levels similar to those observed in untreated (control) cells. Single-cell analysis of cellular responses to oAβ revealed heterogeneous ROS production, resulting in two distinct clusters of cells, one of which was very responsive to the treatment. The presence of carnosine counteracted the overproduction of ROS, also leading to a single, homogeneous cluster, similar to that observed in the case of control cells. Interestingly, unlike ROS response, single-cell analysis of NO production did not show any distinct clusters. Overall, our findings demonstrated the ability of carnosine to mitigate Aβ-induced oxidative stress in mixed glia cells, by rescuing ROS and NO intracellular levels, as well as to normalize the heterogeneous response to the treatment measured in terms of clusters' formation. The present study suggests a therapeutic potential of carnosine in pathologies characterized by oxidative stress including AD.",

      "abstract": "Cancer is considered to be among the main causes of death worldwide. Treatment options for cancer are numerous. The type of cancer and its stage of progression determine which kind of treatment is needed. Nanomedicine is a new field for the treatment of various diseases. Pharmaceutical nanocarriers can be fabricated from various materials such as polymers, metals, or lipid-based surfactants. Carnosine-loaded niosomes have emerged as a promising approach in targeted cancer therapy, offering potential advantages over conventional treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation, by improving drug delivery specificity and reducing side effects. The study demonstrates that the encapsulation of carnosine in niosomes enhances its stability and bioavailability, leading to a significant increase in anticancer efficacy. These findings suggest that niosome technology can serve as an effective delivery system for carnosine, potentially transforming its use in cancer treatment and paving the way for future research in targeted therapies. Nanomaterials provide a good delivery system for this method of treatment. It's used in the treatment and diagnosis of diseases. Numerous investigations have been conducted on nanoscale vesicular systems, such as the most recent generations of vesicular nanocarriers, liposomes, and niosomes. Lipophilic and hydrophilic bioactive chemicals are transported via the niosomes in a vesicle. Since niosomes are composed of non-ionic surfactants mixed with cholesterol or other amphiphilic substances, they have a wide range of applications. The therapy of cancer with carnosine-loaded niosomes is one of these uses. The body synthesizes carnosine, a histidine-containing dipeptide, by enzymatically mixing L-histidine and β-alanine. With its antioxidant activities, Carnosine is considered a drug that can reduce and treat cancerous cells and many other therapeutic applications."

      "abstract": "Ionizing radiation (IR) can cause severe dysfunction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), leading to acute or prolonged myelosuppression. In recent years, physical exercise has been recognized as a healthy lifestyle as it can fight a variety of diseases. However, whether it provides protection against IR is not fully understood. In this study, we revealed that long-term moderate exercise mitigated IR-induced hematopoietic injury by generating carnosine from skeletal muscles. We found that exercised mice displayed reduced loss of HSC number and function after IR, accompanied by alleviated bone marrow damage. Interestingly, these effects were largely abrogated by specific deletion of carnosine synthase Carns1 in skeletal muscles. In contrast, carnosine treatment protected HSCs against IR-induced injury. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that exercise-generated carnosine was specifically transported to HSCs via Slc15a2 and then inhibited p53 transcriptional activity by directly interacting with its core DNA-binding domain, which led to downregulation of the p53 target genes p21 and Puma, thus promoting the proliferation and survival and inhibiting the senescence of irradiated HSCs. More importantly, a similar role of the carnosine/Slc15a2-p53 axis was observed in human cord blood-derived HSCs. Collectively, our data reveal that moderate exercise or carnosine supplementation may be potential antiradiation strategies.",

The aim of the present study was to estimate the level of L-carnosine in plasma and correlate it with the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) and Childhood Autism Rating Scale 2nd Edition, Standard Version (CARS2-ST) scores. To measure L-carnosine level, a bio-analytical method was developed using reverse phase high- liquid chromatography and validated as per International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. METHOD: Children were supplemented with L-carnosine (10-15 mg/kg) along with standard care therapies for 2 months. Before and after supplementation, scores on the ATEC, CARS2-ST, BEARS sleep screening tool, 6-item Gastrointestinal Severity Index, and Parental Stress Scale were evaluated, and L-carnosine was measured at the end of the trial. RESULTS: The calibration curve was linear in the range of 100-600 ng/mL (R2 = 0.998). The level of L-carnosine quantified was 33.7 ± 0.2 ng/mL. There was no significant difference found in any of the outcome measures (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that L-carnosine is detectable in the blood, it was found to be ineffective in the management of ASD in children.

Meanwhile, agar and magnetic iron oxide are the most used materials for drug delivery due to some of their advantages such as the low cost and the larger biocompatibility feature. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-cancer ability of agar-encapsulated carnosine nanoparticles (AgCa-NPs) and agar-encapsulated carnosine nanoparticles-coated magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (AgCaN-MNPs) in human CRC cells, HCT-116. We evaluated the effects of AgCa-NPs and AgCaN-MNPs with a variety of concentrations (0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 40, or 50 mM) on HCT-116 cells after 72 h and 96 h by using MTT assay and observation cell morphology. We then analyzed the cell cycle progression and assessed the expression changes of genes related to apoptosis, autophagy, necroptosis, and angiogenesis after treatment for 96 h. The results showed that AgCa-NPs and AgCaN-MNPs in vitro study decreased HCT-116 cells viability. This effect was attributed to arrest of cell cycle, induction of programmed cell death, and suppression of angiogenesis by AgCa-NPs and AgCaN-MNPs. These findings revealed the antitumor efficacy of AgCa-NPs or AgCaN-MNPs for CRC treatment.",

Geroscience, an interdisciplinary field, studies these mechanisms and their role in age-related diseases. Genomic instability, inflammation, telomere attrition, and other indicators contribute to conditions like cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration. Geroscience identifies geroprotectors, such as resveratrol and metformin, targeting ageing pathways to extend the healthspan. Carnosine, a naturally occurring dipeptide (b-alanine and l-histidine), has emerged as a potential geroprotector with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-glycating properties. Carnosine's benefits extend to muscle function, exercise performance, and cognitive health, making it a promising therapeutic intervention for healthy ageing and oxidative stress-related pathologies. In this review, we summarize the evidence describing carnosine's effects in promoting healthy ageing, providing new insights into improving geroscience.",

Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation leads to the degradation of hyaluronic acid (HA) in the skin, and the with fragmented HA contributes to inflammation. This study revealed that the synergistic combination of carnosine and retinol (ROL) increases HA production in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) by upregulating hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) gene transcription. Simultaneously, the combined treatment of carnosine and ROL significantly attenuates UVB-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis in NHEKs. A significant correlation exists between the increase of HA synthesis and the inhibition of PGE2 production. This study suggested that combined treatment of carnosine and ROL can improve skin aging phenotypes associated with UVB irradiation."

Myotubes were treated with Dex (10 μM) to induce muscle atrophy manifested by decreased myotube diameter, low myosin heavy chain content, and increased expression of muscle atrophy-associated ubiquitin ligases (Atrogin-1, MuRF-1, and Cbl-b). Carnosine (20 mM) treatment significantly improved the myotube diameter and MyHC protein expression level in Dex-treated C2C12 myotubes. It also downregulated the expression of Atrogin-1, MuRF-1, and Cbl-b and suppressed the expression of forkhead box O3 (FoxO3a) mediated by Dex. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species production was increased by Dex but was ameliorated by carnosine treatment. However, HA (20 mM), the component of carnosine, treatment was found ineffective in preventing Dex-induced protein damage. Therefore, based on above results it can be suggested that carnosine could be a potential therapeutic agent to prevent Dex-induced muscle atrophy compared to its components HA.",

Together with its associated complications, the mortality rates have increased. One important complication in those living with T2DM is the acceleration of age-related cognitive decline. T2DM-induced cognitive impairment seriously affects memory, executive function, and quality of life. However, there is a lack of effective treatment for both diabetes and cognitive decline. Thus, finding novel treatments which are cheap, effective in both diabetes and cognitive impairment, are easily accessible, are needed to reduce impact on patients with diabetes and health-care systems. Carnosine, a histidine containing dipeptide, plays a protective role in cognitive diseases due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammation, and anti-glycation properties, all of which may slow the development of neurodegenerative diseases and ischemic injury. Furthermore, carnosine is also involved in regulating glucose and insulin in diabetes. Herein, we discuss the neuroprotective role of carnosine and its mechanisms in T2DM-induced cognitive impairment, which may provide a theoretical basis and evidence base to evaluate whether carnosine has therapeutic effects in alleviating cognitive dysfunction in T2DM patients."

In this study, we developed a carboxymethyl cellulose hydrogel loaded with l-carnosine (CRN@hydrogel) for potential application as a wound dressing. In vitro experiments confirmed that CRN@hydrogel can release over 80% of the drug within 48 h and demonstrated its favorable cytocompatibility and blood compatibility, thus establishing its applicability for safe utilization in clinical practice. Using a rat model, we found that this hydrogel could promote and accelerate wound healing more effectively.

Cells to be tested were seeded in 24-well plates and treated with carnosine at 4 different concentrations (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 µg). After 18 h of incubation, cells were harvested to measure gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines in CMC, tight junction (TJ) proteins in IECs, and muscle cell growth markers in QMCs and PMCs. In vivo trials were conducted to investigate the effect of dietary carnosine on disease parameters in broiler chickens challenged with E. maxima. One hundred and twenty male broiler chickens (0-day-old) were allocated into 4 treatment groups: 1) basal diet without infection (NC), 2) basal diet with E. maxima infection (PC), 3) carnosine at 10.0 mg/kg feed with PC (HCS), and 4) carnosine at 1.0 mg/kg feed with PC (LCS). All groups except NC were orally infected with E. maxima on d 14. Jejunal samples were collected for lesion scoring and jejunum gut tissues were used for transcriptomic analysis of cytokines and TJ proteins. In vitro, carnosine treatment significantly decreased IL-1β gene expression in CMC following LPS stimulation. In vivo feeding studies showed that dietary carnosine increased BW and ADG of chickens in E. maxima-infected groups and reduced the jejunal lesion score and fecal oocyst shedding in HCS group. Jejunal IL-1β, IL-8, and IFN-γ expression were suppressed in the HCS group compared to PC. The expression levels of claudin-1 and occludin in IECs were also increased in HCS following carnosine treatment. In conclusion, these findings highlight the beneficial effects of dietary carnosine supplementation on intestinal immune responses and gut barrier function in broiler chickens exposed to E. maxima infection.",

A total of 59 participants (age 79.7 ± 4.8 years, body mass index 20.99 ± 2.12 kg/m2) were enrolled and randomly assigned to intervention (n = 30) or placebo (n = 28).

CN exhibits considerable water solubility and undergoes in-vivo degradation, hence restricting its application. Consequently, it is anticipated that the developed M-LCNPs will enhance the effectiveness of CN. To ensure the physical stability of MNPs, they were initially coated with a mixture of oleic acid and oleylamine before being included in pegylated liquid crystalline nanoparticles (PLCNPs). The proposed M-LCNPs exhibited promising in-vitro characteristics, notably a small particle size (143.5 nm ± 1.25) and a high zeta potential (-39.5 mV ± 1.54), together with superparamagnetic behavior. The in-vitro release profile exhibited a prolonged release pattern. The IC50 values of M-LCNPs were 1.57 and 1.59 times lower than these of the CN solution after 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Female BALB/C female mice with an induced breast cancer (Ehrlich Ascites tumor [EAT] model) were used to study the influence of an external magnetic field on the chemotherapeutic activity and toxicity of CN loaded in the developed M-LCNPs. Stimuli-responsive M-LCNPs exhibited no apparent systemic toxicity in addition to enhanced chemotherapeutic efficacy compared to nontargeted M-LCNPs and CN solution, as evidenced by a reduction of % tumor growth (11.7%), VEGF levels (22.95 pg/g tissue), and cyclin D1 levels (27.61 ng/g tissue), and an increase in caspase-3 level (28.9 ng/g tissue).

As intraperitoneal administration of CAR reversed liver steatosis, the protein profiles of NAFLD liver and CAR NAFLD liver were evaluated by label-free proteomics approach. A total of 2531 proteins were identified and the 230 and 276 were significantly up- and downregulated, respectively, by CAR treatment of NAFLD rats and involved in fundamental pathways such as oxidative stress and lipid metabolism. Perilipin 2 and apolipoprotein E, components of the plasma membrane of vesicle, resulted in highly downregulated in the CAR-treated NAFLD liver.

We recently reported that oral consumption of a carnosine analog suppressed markers of fibrosis in liver of obese mice, but whether antifibrotic effects of carnosine extend to the heart is not known, nor are the mechanisms by which carnosine is acting. Here, we investigated whether oral carnosine was able to mitigate the adverse cardiac remodeling associated with diet induced obesity in a mouse model of enhanced lipid peroxidation (i.e., glutathione peroxidase 4 deficient mice, GPx4+/-), a model which mimics many of the pathophysiological aspects of metabolic syndrome and T2 diabetes in humans. Wild-type (WT) and GPx4+/-male mice were randomly fed a standard (CNTL) or high fat high sucrose diet (HFHS) for 16 weeks. Seven weeks after starting the diet, a subset of the HFHS mice received carnosine (80 mM) in their drinking water for duration of the study. Carnosine treatment led to a moderate improvement in glycemic control in WT and GPx4+/-mice on HFHS diet, although insulin sensitivity was not significantly affected. Interestingly, while our transcriptomic analysis revealed that carnosine therapy had only modest impact on global gene expression in the heart, carnosine substantially upregulated cardiac GPx4 expression in both WT and GPx4+/-mice on HFHS diet. Carnosine also significantly reduced protein carbonyls and iron levels in myocardial tissue from both genotypes on HFHS diet. Importantly, we observed a robust antifibrotic effect of carnosine therapy in hearts from mice on HFHS diet, which further in vitro experiments suggest is due to carnosine's ability to suppress collagen-cross-linking. Collectively, this study reveals antifibrotic potential of carnosine in the heart with obesity and illustrates key mechanisms by which it may be acting."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Carnosine, a naturally occurring dipeptide, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-glycating effects, with preliminary evidence suggesting it may improve important chronic disease risk factors in adults with cardiometabolic conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this randomised controlled trial, 43 adults (30%F) living with prediabetes or T2DM consumed carnosine (2 g) or a matching placebo daily for 14 weeks to evaluate its effect on glucose metabolism assessed via a 2-h 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. Secondary outcomes included body composition analysis by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), calf muscle density by pQCT, and anthropometry. Carnosine supplementation decreased blood glucose at 90 min (-1.31 mmol/L; p = 0.02) and 120 min (-1.60 mmol/L, p = 0.02) and total glucose area under the curve (-3.30 mmol/L; p = 0.04) following an oral glucose tolerance test. There were no additional changes in secondary outcomes. The carnosine group results remained significant before and after adjustment for age, sex, and change in weight (all>0.05), and in further sensitivity analyses accounting for missing data. There were no significant changes in insulin levels. CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary support for larger trials evaluating carnosine as a potential treatment for prediabetes and the initial stages of T2DM. Likely mechanisms may include changes to hepatic glucose output explaining the observed reduction in blood glucose without changes in insulin secretion following carnosine supplementation.",

Carnosine (CAR) is a dipeptide with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action and has been studied for treating diseases. This work aimed to evaluate the effects of CAR on diet-induced MASLD in rats. Male Wistar rats were distributed into 2 groups (17 weeks): normocaloric (Co, n = 12), and hypercaloric diet rich in lipids and simple carbohydrates (MASLD, n = 12). After, the animals were redistributed to begin the treatment with CAR (4 weeks): Co (n = 6), Co + CAR (n = 6), MASLD (n = 6), and MASLD + CAR (n = 6), administered intraperitoneally (250 mg/kg). Evaluations included nutritional, hormonal and metabolic parameters; hepatic steatosis, inflammatory and oxidative markers. MASLD group had a higher adiposity index, systolic blood pressure, glucose, plasma and liver triglycerides and cholesterol, insulin, hepatic steatosis, oxidative markers, and lower PPAR-α (Peroxisome Proliferator-activated receptor α), compared to the Co. CAR attenuated plasma and hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol levels, hepatic steatosis, CD68+ macrophages, and hepatic oxidative markers, in addition to increasing HDL cholesterol levels and PPAR-α, compared to the untreated MASLD group. CAR acts in importants pathophysiological processes of MASLD and may be a therapeutic compound to control the disease.",

METHODS: Rat models of DM established by high-fat diet feeding and streptozotocin injection were randomized into DM group and 3 treatment groups with daily carnosine treatment at 100, 300, and 900 mg/kg. Body weight and blood glucose level changes of the rats were measured regularly. After the treatment, 24-h urine, serum samples and kidneys of the rats were collected to measure urine volume, urine protein content, blood creatinine, and kidney mass; renal pathology was observed using HE staining, and MDA content and SOD activity in the kidney tissues were detected. Western blotting was performed to detect the protein expressions of p-AKT, AKT, p-mTOR, mTOR, LC3 and p62 in the kidney tissues. RESULTS: Compared with normal control rats, the diabetic rats exhibited dull and wet hair and showed decreased body weight, increased blood glucose, urinary protein content, 24-h urine volume, blood creatinine, and kidney mass with obvious swelling and deformation of the glomeruli, narrowing of the renal tubules, decreased SOD activity and increased MDA content, lowered p-mTOR/mTOR and p-AKT/AKT ratios and increased LC3 Ⅱ/Ⅰ ratio and p62 protein expression in the kidney tissue. The diabetic rats receiving carnosine treatments had dry hair with normal luster and showed increased body weight and slightly decreased blood glucose, urinary protein content, 24-h urine volume, blood creatinine, and kidney mass. The treatment also improved renal pathology, increased SOD activity, decreased MDA content, increased p-mTOR/mTOR and p-AKT/AKT ratios and lowered LC3 Ⅱ/Ⅰ ratio and p62 protein expression in renal tissue of the diabetic rats. CONCLUSION: Carnosine offers protection against nephropathy in rats with DM possibly by inhibiting oxidative stress, activating the AKT/mTOR pathway, and restoring autophagy in the kidneys.",

None of these are cancer-specific and are commonly accompanied by side effects, including urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Moreover, subsequent surgical treatments following biochemical recurrence after these interventions are either limited or affected by the scarring present in the surrounding tissue. Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is a histidine-containing naturally occurring dipeptide which has been shown to have an anti-tumorigenic role without any detrimental effect on healthy cells; however, its effect on prostate cancer cells has never been investigated. In this study, we investigated the effect of carnosine on cell proliferation and metabolism in both a primary cultured androgen-resistant human prostate cancer cell line, PC346Flu1 and murine TRAMP-C1 cells. Our results show that carnosine has a significant dose-dependent inhibitory effect in vitro on the proliferation of both human (PC346Flu1) and murine (TRAMP-C1) prostate cancer cells, which was confirmed in 3D-models of the same cells. Carnosine was also shown to decrease adenosine triphosphate content and reactive species which might have been caused in part by the increase in SIRT3 also shown after carnosine treatment. These encouraging results support the need for further human in vivo work to determine the potential use of carnosine, either alone or, most likely, as an adjunct therapy to surgical or other conventional treatments.",

Carnosine has been suggested as a potential approach to reduce ASCVD risk factors. However, there is a paucity of human data. Hence, we performed a 14-week double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial to determine whether carnosine compared with placebo improves vascular and metabolic outcomes in individuals with prediabetes and T2DM. In total, 49 patients with prediabetes and T2DM with good glycemic control were randomly assigned either to receive 2 g/day carnosine or matching placebo. We evaluated endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, lipid parameters, blood pressure, heart rate, hepatic and renal outcomes before and after the intervention. Carnosine supplementation had no effect on heart rate, peripheral and central blood pressure, endothelial function (logarithm of reactive hyperemia (LnRHI)), arterial stiffness (carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (CF PWV)), lipid parameters, liver fibroscan indicators, liver transient elastography, liver function tests, and renal outcomes compared to placebo. In conclusion, carnosine supplementation did not improve cardiovascular and cardiometabolic risk factors in adults with prediabetes and T2DM with good glycemic control. Therefore, it is improbable that carnosine supplementation would be a viable approach to mitigating the ASCVD risk in these populations. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02917928).",

      "abstract": "Dysregulated metal homeostasis is associated with many pathological conditions, including arthritic diseases. Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are the two most prevalent disorders that damage the joints and lead to cartilage and bone destruction. Recent studies show that the levels of zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) are generally altered in the serum of arthritis patients. Therefore, metal dyshomeostasis may reflect the contribution of these trace elements to the disease's pathogenesis and manifestations, suggesting their potential for prognosis and treatment. Carnosine (Car) also emerged as a biomarker in arthritis and exerts protective and osteogenic effects in arthritic joints. Notably, its zinc(II) complex, polaprezinc, has been recently proposed as a drug-repurposing candidate for bone fracture healing. On these bases, this review article aims to provide an overview of the beneficial roles of Cu and Zn in bone and cartilage health and their potential application in tissue engineering. The effects of Car and polaprezinc in promoting cartilage and bone regeneration are also discussed. We hypothesize that polaprezinc could exchange Zn for Cu, present in the culture media, due to its higher sequestering ability towards Cu. However, future studies should unveil the potential contribution of Cu in the beneficial effects of polaprezinc.",

      "abstract": "Carnosine is an endogenous dipeptide composed of β-alanine and L-histidine, possessing a multimodal pharmacodynamic profile that includes anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. Carnosine has also shown its ability to modulate cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and even glycolytic energy metabolism, all processes playing a key role in the context of cancer. Cancer is one of the most dreaded diseases of the 20th and 21st centuries. Among the different types of cancer, breast cancer represents the most common non-skin cancer among women, accounting for an estimated 15% of all cancer-related deaths in women. The main aim of the present review was to provide an overview of studies on the anti-cancer activity of carnosine, and in particular its activity against breast cancer. We also highlighted the possible advantages and limitations involved in the use of this dipeptide. The first part of the review entailed a brief description of carnosine's biological activities and the pathophysiology of cancer, with a focus on breast cancer. The second part of the review described the anti-tumoral activity of carnosine, for which numerous studies have been carried out, especially at the preclinical level, showing promising results. However, only a few studies have investigated the therapeutic potential of this dipeptide for breast cancer prevention or treatment. In this context, carnosine has shown to be able to decrease the size of cancer cells and their viability. It also reduces the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cyclin D1, NAD+, and ATP, as well as cytochrome c oxidase activity in vitro. When tested in mice with induced breast cancer, carnosine proved to be non-toxic to healthy cells and exhibited chemopreventive activity by reducing tumor growth. Some evidence has also been reported at the clinical level. A randomized phase III prospective placebo-controlled trial showed the ability of Zn-carnosine to prevent dysphagia in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy. Despite this evidence, more preclinical and clinical studies are needed to better understand carnosine's anti-tumoral activity, especially in the context of breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "Carnosine is beta-alanyl histidine, a dipeptide, endogenously produced in our body by the carnosine synthase enzyme. It is an antioxidant, thus protecting from the deleterious effect of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Similarly, aminoguanidine (AG) also prevents AGEs formation by scavenging free radicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS)/reactive carbonyl species (RCS). This study used experimental and computational techniques to perform a comparative analysis of carnosine and AG and their inhibiting properties against glycated human serum albumin (HSA). Fructose-mediated glycation of albumin produced fluorescent structures, such as pentosidine and malondialdehyde. These AGEs were significantly reduced by carnosine and AG. At 20 mM, carnosine and AG quenches pentosidine fluorescence by 66% and 83%, respectively. A similar inhibitory effect was observed for malondialdehyde. Protein hydrophobicity and tryptophan fluorescence were restored in the presence of carnosine and AG. Aminoguanidine decreased fibrillation in HSA, while carnosine did not significantly affect aggregation/fibrillation. In addition, molecular docking study observed binding scores of -5.90 kcal/mol and -2.59 kcal/mol by HSA-aminoguanidine and HSA-carnosine complex, respectively. Aminoguanidine forms one conventional hydrogen bond with ARG A:10 and a salt bridge with ASP A:13, ASP A:259, ASP A:255, and ASP A:256 from the amine group. Similarly, carnosine forms only hydrogen bonds with GLU A:501 and GLN A:508 from the amine and hydroxy group. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) calculated from simulation studies was 1 nm upto 70 ns for the HSA-aminoguanidine complex and the spectrum of HSA-carnosine was significantly deviated and not stabilized. The superior inhibitory activity of aminoguanidine could be due to additional salt bridge bonding with albumin. Conclusively, aminoguanidine can be the better treatment choice for diabetes-associated neurological diseases.",

Carnosine is a histidine-containing dipeptide (HCD) with pluripotent homeostatic properties that is able to improve outcomes in an animal MS model (EAE) when supplied exogenously. To uncover if endogenous carnosine is involved in, and protects against, MS-related neuroinflammation, demyelination or remyelination failure, we here studied the HCD-synthesizing enzyme carnosine synthase (CARNS1) in human MS lesions and two preclinical mouse MS models (EAE, cuprizone). We demonstrate that due to its presence in oligodendrocytes, CARNS1 expression is diminished in demyelinated MS lesions and mouse models mimicking demyelination/inflammation, but returns upon remyelination. Carns1-KO mice that are devoid of endogenous HCDs display exaggerated neuroinflammation and clinical symptoms during EAE, which could be partially rescued by exogenous carnosine treatment. Worsening of the disease appears to be driven by a central, not peripheral immune-modulatory, mechanism possibly linked to impaired clearance of the reactive carbonyl acrolein in Carns1-KO mice. In contrast, CARNS1 is not required for normal oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and (re)myelin to occur, and neither endogenous nor exogenous HCDs protect against cuprizone-induced demyelination. In conclusion, the loss of CARNS1 from demyelinated MS lesions can aggravate disease progression through weakening the endogenous protection against neuroinflammation.",

      "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome characterized by rapid loss of renal excretory function. Its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, plays an important role in AKI. It is characterized by cell swelling and membrane rupture, triggering the release of cellular contents and activating robust inflammatory responses. Carnosine, a dipeptide with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, has therapeutic effects in AKI. However, the mechanism by which carnosine treats AKI-associated pyroptosis remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of carnosine on renal tubule cells using in vivo and in vitro models of AKI. We found that carnosine therapy significantly alleviated altered serum biochemical markers and histopathological changes in mice with cisplatin-induced AKI. It also reduced the levels of inflammation and pyroptosis. These results were consistent with those seen in human kidney tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) treated with cisplatin. Through molecular docking and cellular thermal shift assay, we identified caspase-1 as a target of carnosine. By knocking down caspase-1 in HK-2 cells using caspase-1 siRNA, we demonstrated that carnosine did not exhibit a protective role in cisplatin-induced HK-2 cells. This study provides the first evidence that carnosine alleviates damage to kidney tubular epithelial cells by targeting caspase-1 and inhibiting pyroptosis. Therefore, carnosine holds promise as a potential therapeutic agent for AKI, with caspase-1 representing an effective therapeutic target in this pathology."

      "abstract": "Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) often remain untreated because they are difficult to heal, caused by reduced skin sensitivity and impaired blood vessel formation. In this study, we propose a novel approach to manage DFUs using a multifunctional hydrogel made from a combination of alginate and gum arabic. To enhance the healing properties of the hydrogel, we immobilized nerve growth factor (NGF), within specially designed mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN). The MSNs were then incorporated into the hydrogel along with carnosine (Car), which further improves the hydrogel's therapeutic properties. The hydrogel containing the immobilized NGF (SiNGF) could control the sustain release of NGF for >21 days, indicating that the target hydrogel (AG-Car/SiNGF) can serve as a suitable reservoir managing diabetic wound regeneration. In addition, Car was able to effectively reduce inflammation and significantly increase angiogenesis compared to the control group. Based on the histological results obtained from diabetic rats, the target hydrogel (AG-Car/SiNGF) reduced inflammation and improved re-epithelialization, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition. Specific staining also confirmed that AG-Car/SiNGF exhibited improved tissue neovascularization, transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) expression, and nerve neurofilament. Overall, our research suggests that this newly developed composite system holds promise as a potential treatment for non-healing diabetic wounds.",

      "abstract": "Background: Increasing evidence suggests that hemodynamic disturbed flow induces endothelial dysfunction via a complex biological process so-called endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). Recently, DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) was reported as a key molecular mediator to promote EndoMT. Our understanding of how DNMTs, particularly the maintenance DNMTs, DNMT1, coordinate EndoMT is still lacking. Methods: A parallel-plate flow apparatus and perfusion devices were used to apply fluid with endothelial protective pulsatile shear (PS, to mimic the laminar flow) or harmful oscillatory shear (OS, to mimic the disturbed flow) to cultured endothelial cells (ECs). Endothelial lineage tracing mice and conditional EC Dnmt1 knockout mice were subjected to a surgery of carotid partial ligation to generate the flow-accelerated atherogenesis models. Western blotting, quantitative RT-PCR, immunofluorescent staining, methylation-specific PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation, endothelial functional assays, and assessments for neointimal formation and atherosclerosis were performed. Results: Inhibition of DNMTs with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) suppressed the disturbed flow/OS-induced EndoMT, both in cultured cells and the endothelial lineage tracing mice. 5-Aza also ameliorated the downregulation of aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) and β-alanine biosynthesis caused by disturbed flow/OS. Knockdown of the ALDH family proteins, ALDH2, ALDH3A1, and ALDH6A1, showed an EndoMT-induction effect as OS. Supplementation of cells with the functional metabolites of β-alanine, carnosine and acetyl-CoA (acetate), reversed EndoMT, likely via inhibiting the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Endothelial-specific knockout of Dnmt1 protected the vasculature from disturbed flow-induced remodeling and atherosclerosis. Conclusions: Endothelial DNMT1 acts as one of the key epigenetic factors to mediate the hemodynamically regulated EndoMT at least through repressing the expression of ALDH2, ALDH3A1, and ALDH6A1. Supplementation with carnosine and acetate may have a great potential in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.",

A comparative biochemical study between L-carnosine and β-alanine in amelioration of hypobaric hypoxia-induced skeletal muscle protein loss. High Alt Med Biol. 24:302-311, 2023. Background: Carnosine (CAR; β-alanyl-L-histidine), a biologically active dipeptide is known for its unique pH-buffering capacity, metal chelating activity, and antioxidant and antiglycation property. β-Alanine (ALA) is a nonessential amino acid and used to enhance performance and cognitive functions. Hypobaric hypoxia (HH)-induced muscle protein loss is regulated by multifaceted signaling pathways. The present study investigated the beneficial effects of CAR and ALA against HH-associated muscle loss. Methodology: Simulated HH exposure was performed in an animal decompression chamber. Gastric oral administration of CAR (50 mg·kg-1) and ALA (450 mg·kg-1) were given daily for 3 days and at the end of the treatment, hindlimb skeletal muscle tissue was excised for western blot and biochemical assays. Results: Cosupplementation of CAR and ALA alone was able to ameliorate the hypoxia-induced inflammation, oxidative stress (FOXO), ER stress (GRP-78), and atrophic signaling (MuRF-1) in the skeletal muscles. Creatinine phospho kinase activity and apoptosis were also decreased in CAR- and ALA-supplemented rats. However, CAR showed enhanced protection in HH-induced muscle loss as CAR supplementation was able to enhance protein concentration, body weight, and decreased the protein oxidation and ALA administration was not able to restore the same. Conclusions: Hence, the present comprehensive study supports the fact that CAR (50 mg·kg-1) is more beneficial as compared with ALA (450 mg·kg-1) in ameliorating the hypoxia-induced skeletal muscle loss.",

Carnosine (Car), a dipeptide consisting of β-alanine and L-histidine, has been shown to ameliorate HG-induced tubular epithelial cells inflammation. Whether Car exerts protective effects on AKI, and its molecular mechanism have not been clarified. Our in vivo and in vitro IR-AKI mouse models demonstrated that Car alleviates kidney injury, inflammation and ferroptosis. In hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR) induced human renal tubular epithelial cells (HK2), Car treatment reduced lipid peroxidation and iron accumulation, suppressed oxidative stress, and inhibited ferroptosis. Through cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and molecular docking, we identified GPX4 as a potential target that binds with Car. Further study showed that overexpressed GPX4 had a comparable protective effect on HK2 cells under HR conditions, similar to Car. Additionally, our findings demonstrated that Car exhibited similar anti-ferroptosis effects in both folic acid (FA)-induced AKI mouse models and Erastin induced HK2 cells. In conclusion, our results highlight that Car alleviate renal IR injury by inhibiting GPX4-mediated ferroptosis. Car shows promise as a potential therapeutic drug for IR-AKI and other diseases associated with ferroptosis."

This prospective cohort study aims to test the effect of a zinc-L-carnosine mouthwash in promoting oral surgical wound healing. METHODS: From October 2022 to February 2023, the authors enrolled healthy adult volunteers who needed the extraction of bilateral molars at the Unit of Dentistry of the University of Bari. The authors studied the baseline wound healing of each patient after the first extraction. Three months later, the patients underwent the second extraction and rinsed their mouths with zinc-L-carnosine mouthwash twice per day for the following 28 postoperative days. For a month after each extraction, the patients received weekly follow-up visits by an oral surgeon blinded about the study to record the modified healing index score of the wounds (range 0-6 points). For statistical analysis, we used the one-tailed t-test for paired samples with a significance level set at p < 0.05 to compare the baseline scores with those recorded during the exposure to the zinc-L-carnosine mouthwash. RESULTS: The authors enrolled four women and six men (mean age = 44.60 ± 19.22 years). On the seventh and fourteenth postoperative days, the mean difference between the modified healing index scores obtained by using the zinc-L-carnosine mouthwash and the baseline was not significant. On the twenty-first postoperative day, the mean score obtained by using the mouthwash was 5.2 ± 1.3 points and was significantly higher than the 4.7 ± 1.8 points of the baseline (p = 0.026). On the twenty-eighth postoperative day, the mean difference was significant as well (5.9 ± 0.3 points and 5.4 ± 1.1 points, respectively). CONCLUSION: The preliminary results of this study showed that the zinc-L-carnosine mouthwash improved the quality of oral surgical wound healing."

The injury of renal tubular epithelial cells is a significant reason for the occurrence of ESRD. A recent research demonstrated that ferroptosis was associated with renal tubular injury in DN. Ferroptosis is a kind of cell death brought on by the buildup of iron ions and lipid peroxidation brought on by ROS. Because carnosine (CAR) is a scavenger of iron ions and reactive oxygen species, we investigated whether CAR can improve DN by regulating ferroptosis. The results show that both CAR and Fer-1 significantly reduced kidney damage and inhibited ferroptosis in STZ mice. In addition, ferroptosis caused by HG or erastin (an inducer of ferroptosis) in human kidney tubular epithelial cell (HK2) was also rescued by CAR treatment. It was discovered that the protective effect of CAR against HG-induced ferroptosis was abolished when NRF2 was specifically knocked down in HK2 cells."

      "abstract": "The lipid profile of skin is fundamental in the maintenance of the protective barrier against the external environment. Signaling and constitutive lipids of this large organ are involved in inflammation, metabolism, aging, and wound healing, such as phospholipids, triglycerides, FFA, and sphingomyelin. Skin exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation results in a photoaging process that is an accelerated form of aging. UV-A radiation deeply penetrates the dermis and promotes damage to DNA, lipids, and proteins by increasing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Carnosine, an endogenous β-alanyl-L-histidine dipeptide, demonstrated antioxidant properties that prevent photoaging and modification of skin protein profiling, making carnosine a compelling ingredient to consider for use in dermatology. The aim of this research was to investigate the modification of skin lipidome after UV-A treatment in presence or not of topic administration of carnosine. Quantitative analyses based on high-resolution mass spectrometry of nude mice skin-extracted lipids resulted in several modifications of barrier composition after UV-A radiation, with or without carnosine treatment. In total, 328 out of 683 molecules showed significant alteration-262 after UV-A radiation and 126 after UV-A and carnosine treatment versus controls. Importantly, the increased oxidized TGs after UV-A radiation, responsible of dermis photoaging, were completely reverted by carnosine application to prevent the UV-A damage. Network analyses also showed that the production of ROS and the calcium and TNF signaling were modulated by UV-A and carnosine. In conclusion, lipidome analyses attested the carnosine activity to prevent the UV-A damage, reducing the lipid oxidation, the inflammation, and the dysregulation of lipid skin barrier.",

This study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective properties of a nanomicellar complex of carnosine and lipoic acid (CLA) in a rotenone-induced rat model of PD. Parkinsonism was induced via the administration of 2 mg/kg rotenone over the course of 18 days. Two doses of intraperitoneal CLA (25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) were administered alongside rotenone to assess its neuroprotective effect. At 25 mg/kg CLA decreased muscle rigidity and partially restored locomotor activity in animals that received rotenone. Furthermore, it caused an overall increase in brain tissue antioxidant activity, accompanied by a 19% increase in neuron density in the substantia nigra and increased dopamine levels in the striatum relative to animals that only received rotenone. Based on the acquired results, it may be concluded that CLA have neuroprotective properties and could potentially be beneficial in PD treatment when used in conjunction with the base therapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Muscle wasting during cancer cachexia is mediated by protein degradation via autophagy and ubiquitin-linked proteolysis. These processes are sensitive to changes in intracellular pH ([pH]i ) and reactive oxygen species, which in skeletal muscle are partly regulated by histidyl dipeptides, such as carnosine. These dipeptides, synthesized by the enzyme carnosine synthase (CARNS), remove lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes, and buffer [pH]i . Nevertheless, their role in muscle wasting has not been studied. METHODS: Histidyl dipeptides in the rectus abdominis (RA) muscle and red blood cells (RBCs) of male and female controls (n = 37), weight stable (WS: n = 35), and weight losing (WL; n = 30) upper gastrointestinal cancer (UGIC) patients, were profiled by LC-MS/MS. Expression of enzymes and amino acid transporters, involved in carnosine homeostasis, was measured by Western blotting and RT-PCR. Skeletal muscle myotubes were treated with Lewis lung carcinoma conditioned medium (LLC CM), and β-alanine to study the effects of enhancing carnosine production on muscle wasting. RESULTS: Carnosine was the predominant dipeptide present in the RA muscle. In controls, carnosine levels were higher in men (7.87 ± 1.98 nmol/mg tissue) compared with women (4.73 ± 1.26 nmol/mg tissue; P = 0.002). In men, carnosine was significantly reduced in both the WS (5.92 ± 2.04 nmol/mg tissue, P = 0.009) and WL (6.15 ± 1.90 nmol/mg tissue; P = 0.030) UGIC patients, compared with controls. In women, carnosine was decreased in the WL UGIC (3.42 ± 1.33 nmol/mg tissue; P = 0.050), compared with WS UGIC patients (4.58 ± 1.57 nmol/mg tissue), and controls (P = 0.025). Carnosine was significantly reduced in the combined WL UGIC patients (5.12 ± 2.15 nmol/mg tissue) compared with controls (6.21 ± 2.24 nmol/mg tissue; P = 0.045). Carnosine was also significantly reduced in the RBCs of WL UGIC patients (0.32 ± 0.24 pmol/mg protein), compared with controls (0.49 ± 0.31 pmol/mg protein, P = 0.037) and WS UGIC patients (0.51 ± 0.40 pmol/mg protein, P = 0.042). Depletion of carnosine diminished the aldehyde-removing ability in the muscle of WL UGIC patients. Carnosine levels were positively associated with decreases in skeletal muscle index in the WL UGIC patients. CARNS expression was decreased in the muscle of WL UGIC patients and myotubes treated with LLC-CM. Treatment with β-alanine, a carnosine precursor, enhanced endogenous carnosine production and decreased ubiquitin-linked protein degradation in LLC-CM treated myotubes. CONCLUSIONS: Depletion of carnosine could contribute to muscle wasting in cancer patients by lowering the aldehyde quenching abilities. Synthesis of carnosine by CARNS in myotubes is particularly affected by tumour derived factors and could contribute to carnosine depletion in WL UGIC patients. Increasing carnosine in skeletal muscle may be an effective therapeutic intervention to prevent muscle wasting in cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has been described as a progressive eye disease characterized by irreversible impairment of central vision, and unfortunately, an effective treatment is still not available. It is well-known that amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide is one of the major culprits in causing neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The extracellular accumulation of this peptide has also been found in drusen which lies under the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and represents one of the early signs of AMD pathology. Aβ aggregates, especially in the form of oligomers, are able to induce pro-oxidant (oxidative stress) and pro-inflammatory phenomena in RPE cells. ARPE-19 is a spontaneously arising human RPE cell line validated for drug discovery processes in AMD. In the present study, we employed ARPE-19 treated with Aβ oligomers, representing an in vitro model of AMD. We used a combination of methods, including ATPlite, quantitative real-time PCR, immunocytochemistry, as well as a fluorescent probe for reactive oxygen species to investigate the molecular alterations induced by Aβ oligomers. In particular, we found that Aβ exposure decreased the cell viability of ARPE-19 cells which was paralleled by increased inflammation (increased expression of pro-inflammatory mediators) and oxidative stress (increased expression of NADPH oxidase and ROS production) along with the destruction of ZO-1 tight junction protein. Once the damage was clarified, we investigated the therapeutic potential of carnosine, an endogenous dipeptide that is known to be reduced in AMD patients. Our findings demonstrate that carnosine was able to counteract most of the molecular alterations induced by the challenge of ARPE-19 with Aβ oligomers. These new findings obtained with ARPE-19 cells challenged with Aβ1-42 oligomers, along with the well-demonstrated multimodal mechanism of action of carnosine both in vitro and in vivo, able to prevent and/or counteract the dysfunctions elicited by Aβ oligomers, substantiate the neuroprotective potential of this dipeptide in the context of AMD pathology.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Carnosine can suppress secondary complications in diabetes and show robust neuroprotective activity against neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report that carnosine ameliorates diabetes-associated cognitive decline in vivo through the modulation of autophagy. METHODS: A high-fat diet (HFD) and one intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) were used to induce type 2 diabetes mellitus in Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were randomly divided into five groups: control (CON), HFD/STZ, and three intragastric carnosine treatment groups receiving low (100 mg/kg), medium (300 mg/kg), and high (900 mg/kg) doses over 12 weeks. Body weight, blood glucose levels, and cognitive function were continuously monitored. From excised rat hippocampi, we determined superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels; carnosine concentration; protein expressions of Akt, mTOR and the autophagy markers LC3B and P62 and performed histopathological evaluations of the cornu ammonis 1 region. RESULTS: The HFD/STZ group showed increased blood glucose levels and decreased body weight compared to the CON group. However, there were no significant differences in body weight and blood glucose levels between carnosine-treated and -untreated HFD-STZ-induced diabetic rats. Diabetic animals showed obvious learning and memory impairments in the Morris water maze test compared to the CON group. Compared to those in the HFD/STZ group, carnosine increased SOD activity and decreased MDA levels, increased hippocampal carnosine concentration, increased p-Akt and p-mTOR expression, decreased LC3B and P62 expression, alleviated neuronal injuries, and improved cognitive performance in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Independent of any hyperglycemic effect, carnosine may improve mild cognitive impairments by mitigating oxidative stress, activating the Akt/mTOR pathway, and modulating autophagy in the hippocampus of type 2 diabetic rats.",

      "abstract": "Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is a naturally occurring endogenous peptide widely distributed in excitable tissues such as the brain. This dipeptide possesses well-demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-aggregation properties, and it may be useful for treatment of pathologies characterized by oxidative stress and energy unbalance such as depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglia, the brain-resident macrophages, are involved in different physiological brain activities such synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, but their dysregulation has been linked to the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. In AD brain, the activation of microglia towards a pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory phenotype has found in an early phase of cognitive decline, reason why new pharmacological targets related to microglia activation are of great importance to develop innovative therapeutic strategies. In particular, microglia represent a common model of lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced activation to identify novel pharmacological targets for depression and AD and numerous studies have linked the impairment of energy metabolism, including ATP dyshomeostasis, to the onset of depressive episodes. In the present study, we first investigated the toxic potential of LPS + ATP in the absence or presence of carnosine. Our studies were carried out on human microglia (HMC3 cell line) in which LPS + ATP combination has shown the ability to promote cell death, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Additionally, to shed more light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effect of carnosine, its ability to modulate reactive oxygen species production and the variation of parameters representative of cellular energy metabolism was evaluated by microchip electrophoresis coupled to laser-induced fluorescence and high performance liquid chromatography, respectively. In our experimental conditions, carnosine prevented LPS + ATP-induced cell death and oxidative stress, also completely restoring basal energy metabolism in human HMC3 microglia. Our results suggest a therapeutic potential of carnosine as a new pharmacological tool in the context of multifactorial disorders characterize by neuroinflammatory phenomena including depression and AD."

      "abstract": "The dipeptide carnosine is a physiologically important molecule in the human body, commonly found in skeletal muscle and brain tissue. Beta-alanine is a limiting precursor of carnosine and is among the most used sports supplements for improving athletic performance. However, carnosine, its metabolite N-acetylcarnosine, and the synthetic derivative zinc-L-carnosine have recently been gaining popularity as supplements in human medicine. These molecules have a wide range of effects-principally with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiglycation, anticarbonylation, calcium-regulatory, immunomodulatory and chelating properties. This review discusses results from recent studies focusing on the impact of this supplementation in several areas of human medicine. We queried PubMed, Web of Science, the National Library of Medicine and the Cochrane Library, employing a search strategy using database-specific keywords. Evidence showed that the supplementation had a beneficial impact in the prevention of sarcopenia, the preservation of cognitive abilities and the improvement of neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, the improvement of diabetes mellitus parameters and symptoms of oral mucositis was seen, as well as the regression of esophagitis and taste disorders after chemotherapy, the protection of the gastrointestinal mucosa and the support of Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment. However, in the areas of senile cataracts, cardiovascular disease, schizophrenia and autistic disorders, the results are inconclusive.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress is due to an unbalance between pro-oxidants, such as reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species, and antioxidants/antioxidant system. Under physiological conditions these species are involved in different cellular processes such as cellular homeostasis and immune response, while an excessive production of ROS/RNS has been linked to the development of various diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. In this context, the naturally occurring dipeptide carnosine has shown the ability to scavenge ROS, counteract lipid peroxidation, and inhibit proteins oxidation. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) have been widely used to produce cosmetics, in wastewater treatment, in food industry, and in healthcare product. As consequence, these NPs are often released into aquatic environments. The Danio rerio (commonly called zebrafish) embryos exposure to TiO2-NPs did not affect the hatching rate, but induced oxidative stress. According to this scenario, in the present study, we first investigated the effects of carnosine exposure and of a sub-toxic administration of TiO2-NPs on the development and survival of zebrafish embryos/larvae measured through the acute embryo toxicity test (FET-Test). Zebrafish larvae represent a useful model to study oxidative stress-linked disorders and to test antioxidant molecules, while carnosine was selected based on its well-known multimodal mechanism of action that includes a strong antioxidant activity. Once the basal effects of carnosine were assessed, we then evaluated its effects on TiO2-NPs-induced oxidative stress in zebrafish larvae, measured in terms of total ROS production (measured with 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate probe) and protein expression by immunohistochemistry of two cellular stress markers, 70 kDa-heat shock protein (Hsp70) and metallothioneins (MTs). We demonstrated that carnosine did not alter the phenotypes of both embryos and larvae of zebrafish at different hours post fertilization. Carnosine was instead able to significantly decrease the enhancement of ROS levels in zebrafish larvae exposed to TiO2-NPs and its antioxidant effect was paralleled by the rescue of the protein expression levels of Hsp70 and MTs. Our results suggest a therapeutic potential of carnosine as a new pharmacological tool in the context of pathologies characterized by oxidative stress such as neurodegenerative disorders."

This study aimed to infer the carnosine-mediated interaction between muscle cells and neuronal cells. The results revealed that carnosine induces muscle cell differentiation, as well as the secretion of exosomes and myokines that can act on neuronal cells. Carnosine acts not only on intestinal cells but also on muscle cells, stimulating the secretion of secretory factors including exosomes that induce neurite outgrowth in neuronal cells, as well as myokines known to be involved in neuronal cell activation. As the miRNAs in exosomes secreted from intestinal cells and muscle cells upon carnosine treatment are different, it could be assumed that carnosine acts on each cell to interact with neuronal cell through separate factors and mechanisms.",

Secondary outcome measures were done to assess the improvement in cognitive symptoms (executive function, attention, and memory) at 24 weeks using subtests of NIMHANS (National Institute for Mental Health and Neurosciences) cognitive battery. Side effects were assessed using adverse events reporting form. The attention scores (p = .023) showed significant differences in patients receiving 800 mg of L-Carnosine at the end of the study. There were no significant differences in negative symptoms in the two arms at study completion.

      "abstract": "The targeting of tumor metabolism as a novel strategy for cancer therapy has attracted tremendous attention. Herein, we develop a dual metabolism inhibitor, Zn-carnosine metallodrug network nanoparticles (Zn-Car MNs), which exhibits good Cu-depletion and Cu-responsive drug release, causing potent inhibition of both OXPHOS and glycolysis. Notably, Zn-Car MNs can decrease the activity of cytochrome c oxidase and the content of NAD+, so as to reduce ATP production in cancer cells. Thereby, energy deprivation, together with the depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential and increased oxidative stress, results in apoptosis of cancer cells. In result, Zn-Car MNs exerted more efficient metabolism-targeted therapy than the classic copper chelator, tetrathiomolybdate (TM), in both breast cancer (sensitive to copper depletion) and colon cancer (less sensitive to copper depletion) models. The efficacy and therapy of Zn-Car MNs suggest the possibility to overcome the drug resistance caused by metabolic reprogramming in tumors and has potential clinical relevance.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-oxidative, anti-inflammative, and anti-pyroptotic effects of carnosine in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mouse model. After a daily pre-treatment of saline or carnosine (1000 mg / kg / day) for 14 days, mice (n = 24) were subjected to tMCAO for 60 min and continuously treated with saline or carnosine for additional 1 and 5 days after reperfusion. The administration of carnosine significantly decreased infarct volume 5 days after the tMCAO (*p < 0.05) and effectively suppressed the expression of 4-HNE, 8-OHdG, Nitrotyrosine 5 days, and RAGE 5 days after tMCAO. Moreover, the expression of IL-1β was also significantly suppressed 5 days after tMCAO. Our present findings demonstrated that carnosine effectively relieves oxidative stress caused by ischemic stroke and significantly attenuates neuroinflammatory responses related to IL-1β, suggesting that carnosine can be a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.",

The obtained results indicate that UVA dysregulates Oxidative Phosphorylation, the Fibrosis Signaling Pathway, Glycolysis I and Nrf2-mediated Oxidative Stress Response. Carnosine exercises provide a protective function against the harmful effects of UVA radiation by activating the Nrf2 pathway with the upregulations of some ROS-detoxifying enzymes such as the glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein family. Additionally, carnosine regulates the activation of the Epithelial Adherens Junction and Wound Healing Signaling Pathway by mediating the activation of structural proteins such as vinculin and zyxin as well as fibronectin 1 and collagen type XVIII alpha 1 chain against UVA-induced changes."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on adult male Wistar rats, divided into control and experimental groups. Animals were kept in standard laboratory conditions and according to groups were treated with saline, carnosine, carnosine dietary supplement, simvastatin, and their combinations. All substances were prepared fresh every day and used by oral gavage. RESULTS: Treatment with a carnosine-based supplement significantly improved total and LDL cholesterol levels in serum, especially in the combination with simvastatin as a conventional drug in dyslipidemia treatment. The effect of carnosine on the metabolism of triglycerides was not as evident as in the case of cholesterol. Nevertheless, the values of the atherogenic index showed that the combinations of carnosine and carnosine supplement with simvastatin were the most effective in lowering this comprehensive lipid index. Dietary carnosine supplementation resulted also in anti-inflammatory effects, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical analyses. Besides, the good safety profile of carnosine in terms of its effect on liver and kidney functions was also confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: The use of carnosine supplements in preventing and/or treatment of metabolic disorders requires further investigations into the mechanisms of action and potential interactions with conventional therapy.",

In rats treated with carnosine, the concentration of MMP-2 in the urine decreased by 3.7 times, and the excretion of MMP-2 with urine decreased by 4.3 times. In the homogenate of the kidneys from rats treated with carnosine, the concentration of TBA-reactive substances decreased by 5 times and the concentration of MMP-2 decreased by 12.7%. After treatment with carnosine, the number of histologically confirmed cases of urate nephrolithiasis decreased by 2 times, while the mean size of urate deposits decreased by 2.7 times. Thus, carnosine inhibits MMP-2 and reduces the intensity of oxidative stress in the kidneys, which prevents the development of urate nephrolithiasis.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: L-carnosine has been found to have multimodal activity. AIM: The aim of this review was to find out the efficacy of L-carnosine in patients with age-related diseases. METHODS: Clinical studies evaluated the effect of L-carnosine on cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders were searched in electronic bibliographic databases. The protocol has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022314033). The revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials was used to assess all of the reports for risk of bias. RevMan 5.4 was used to conduct the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Following the screening process, 14 papers were selected for systematic review, with 9 of them being qualified for meta-analysis. Many of the included studies showed that L-carnosine has potential therapeutic activity in age related diseases. Results from the meta-analysis showed that in diabetes mellitus, HbA1c [mean difference (MD) 95% CI = -1.25 (-2.49, -0.022); p = 0.05; p = 0.001; I2 = 85%] and fasting blood sugar (FBS) [MD 95% CI = -12.44 (-22.44, -2.44); p = 0.01; p = 0.40; I2 = 0%] and in neurodegenerative disorder, Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory 2 (WMS-LM2) [MD 95% CI = 1.34 (0.83, 1.85); p < 0.00001; p = 0.43; I2 = 0%], showed statistically significant difference, favoring the L-carnosine group over the control group. While in neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) [MD 95% CI = 0.98 (-1.55, -0.42); p = 0.0007; p = 0.86; I2 = 0%] and Back Depression Inventory (BDI) [MD 95% CI = -1.12 (-1.87, -0.37); p = 0.003; p = 0.73; I2 = 0%] showed statistically significant difference, favoring the control group over L-carnosine group. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical studies were conducted to manage chemotherapy induced toxicities and there are no clinical studies available for its anti-cancer use, and the current evidence does not support its use in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.",

      "abstract": "Cholestasis is a clinical complication that primarily influences the liver. However, it is well known that many other organs could be affected by cholestasis. Lung tissue is a major organ influenced during cholestasis. Cholestasis-induced lung injury could induce severe complications such as respiratory distress, serious pulmonary infections, and tissue fibrosis. Unfortunately, there is no specific pharmacological intervention against this complication. Several studies revealed that oxidative stress and inflammatory response play a role in cholestasis-induced lung injury. Carnosine (CARN) is a dipeptide found at high concentrations in different tissues of humans. CARN's antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties are repeatedly mentioned in various experimental models. This study aimed to assess the role of CARN on cholestasis-induced lung injury. Rats underwent bile duct ligation (BDL) to induce cholestasis. Broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) levels of inflammatory cells, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and immunoglobulin were monitored at scheduled intervals (7, 14, and 28 days after BDL). Moreover, lung tissue histopathological alterations and biomarkers of oxidative stress were evaluated. A significant increase in BALF inflammatory cells, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and immunoglobulin-G (IgG) was detected in the BALF of BDL rats. Moreover, lung tissue histopathological changes, collagen deposition, increased TGF-β, and elevated levels of oxidative stress biomarkers were evident in cholestatic animals. It was found that CARN (100 and 500 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly alleviated lung oxidative stress biomarkers, inflammatory response, tissue fibrosis, and histopathological alterations. These data indicate the potential protective properties of CARN in the management of cholestasis-induced pulmonary damage. The effects of CARN on inflammatory response and oxidative stress biomarkers seems to play a crucial role in its protective properties in the lung of cholestatic animals.",

      "abstract": "Type-2 diabetes (T2D) is characterised by a dysregulation of metabolism, including skeletal muscle insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Reactive species, such as methylglyoxal (MGO) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), positively associate with T2D disease severity and can directly interfere with insulin signalling and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle by modifying cellular proteins. The multifunctional dipeptide carnosine, and its rate-limiting precursor β-alanine, have recently been shown to improve glycaemic control in humans and rodents with diabetes. However, the precise mechanisms are unclear and research in human skeletal muscle is limited. Herein, we present novel findings in primary human T2D and lean healthy control (LHC) skeletal muscle cells. Cells were differentiated to myotubes, and treated with 10 mM carnosine, 10 mM β-alanine, or control for 4-days. T2D cells had reduced ATP-linked and maximal respiration compared with LHC cells (p = 0.016 and p = 0.005). Treatment with 10 mM carnosine significantly increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in T2D cells (p = 0.047); with no effect in LHC cells. Insulin-stimulation increased MGO-modified proteins in T2D cells by 47%; treatment with carnosine attenuated this increase to 9.7% (p = 0.011). There was no effect treatment on cell viability or expression of other proteins. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of carnosine on glycaemic control may be explained by its scavenging actions in human skeletal muscle.",

However, no research has been found on the effects of dietary β-alanine in the meat quality control of finishing pigs, which are among the research focus. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary β-alanine supplementation on growth performance, meat quality, carnosine content, amino acid composition and muscular antioxidant capacity of Chinese indigenous Ningxiang pigs. The treatments contained a basal diet (control, CON) and a basal diet supplemented with 600 mg/kg β-alanine. Each treatment group consisted of five pens, with five pigs per pen. Results showed that compared with CON, supplemental β-alanine did not affect the final body weight, average daily gain, average daily feed intake and the feed-to-gain ratio of pigs. Dietary β-alanine supplementation tended to increase the pH45 min (p = 0.071) while decreasing the shear force (p = 0.085) and the drip loss (p = 0.091). Moreover, it improved (p < 0.05) the activities of glutathione peroxidase and catalase and lessened (p < 0.05) malondialdehyde concentration. Added β-alanine in diets of finishing pigs could enhance the concentrations of arginine, alanine, and glutamate (p < 0.05) in the longissimus dorsi muscle and tended to raise the levels of cysteine, glycine and anserine (p = 0.060, p = 0.098 and p = 0.091 respectively). Taken together, our results showed that dietary β-alanine supplementation contributed to the improvement of the carcass traits, meat quality and anserine content, the amelioration of muscle antioxidant capacity and the regulation of amino acid composition in Chinese indigenous Ningxiang pigs.",

      "abstract": "Idiopathic Pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic interstitial lung disease, has pulmonary manifestations clinically characterized by collagen deposition, epithelial cell injury, and a decline in lung function. L-carnosine, a dipeptide consisting of β-alanine and L-histidine, has demonstrated a therapeutic effect on various diseases because of its pivotal function. Despite the effect of L-carnosine in experimental IPF mice, its anti-oxidative effect and associated intercellular pathway, particularly alveolar epithelial cells, remain unknown. Therefore, we demonstrated the anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects of L-carnosine via Reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation in bleomycin (BLM)-induced IPF mice. The mice were intratracheally injected with BLM (3 mg/kg) and L-carnosine (150 mg/kg) was orally administrated for 2 weeks. BLM exposure increased the protein level of Nox2, Nox4, p53, and Caspase-3, whereas L-carnosine treatment suppressed the protein level of Nox2, Nox4, p53, and Caspase-3 cleavage in mice. In addition, the total SOD activity and mRNA level of Sod2, catalase, and Nqo1 increased in mice treated with L-carnosine. At the cellular level, a human fibroblast (MRC-5) and mouse alveolar epithelial cell (MLE-12) were exposed to TGFβ1 following L-carnosine treatment to induce fibrogenesis. Moreover, MLE-12 cells were exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE). Consequently, L-carnosine treatment ameliorated fibrogenesis in fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells, and inflammation induced by ROS and CSE exposure was ameliorated. These results were associated with the inhibition of the NFκB pathway. Collectively, our data indicate that L-carnosine induces anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects on alveolar epithelial cells against the pathogenesis of IPF."

Numerous cell and animal model studies have proved that carnosine and its compounds promote the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts, inhibit osteoclasts and protect chondrocytes. They also regulate the cell cycle of bone progenitor cells and the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, accelerate fracture healing, delay bone tumor development and ameliorate osteopenia induced by estrogen deficiency or disuse. The correlations between carnosine and activation signal molecules, pluripotent differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and interaction between bone cells are unclear. However, studies have proved that carnosine and its compounds have benefits in preventing and treating specific bone diseases. This makes them potential agents for the treatment of osteoporosis and bone tumors. The present review summarized the existing research on carnosine and its compounds in bone cells and tissue. It focused on the physiological function of carnosine and its compounds in the bone and their effect on bone metabolism‑related diseases, thus providing support for developing new strategies for targeted therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A complex of Zn and carnosine, called Zinc-L-carnosine (ZnC), enjoys a wide application as part of a Zn supplement therapeutic method as well as in treating peptic ulcers. However, researches fail to confirm the biological functions possessed by ZnC as well as tumor immune microenvironment in colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: Cell counting kit 8(CCK8), 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), transwell and wound healing assays were conducted to study the influence of ZnC in the proliferating, invading and migrating processes of CRC cell lines (HCT116, LOVO) in vitro. The antitumor activity ZnC as well as its effects on tumor immune microenvironment were then assessed using CRC subcutaneous tumors in the C57BL/6 mouse model. RESULTS: According to CCK8, EdU, transwell and wound healing assays, ZnC inhibited CRC cell lines in terms of proliferation, invasion and migration. ZnC could inhibit miR-570 for up-regulating PD-L1 expression. In vivo experiments showed that gavage (100 mg/kg, once every day) of ZnC inhibited the tumor growth of CRC, and the combination of ZnC and anti-PD1 therapy significantly improved the efficacy exhibited by anti-PD1 in treating CRC. In addition, mass cytometry results showed that immunosuppressive cells including regulatory T cells (tregs), bone marrow-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), and M2 macrophages decreased whereas CD8+ T cells elevated after adding ZnC. CONCLUSIONS: The present study reveals that ZnC slows the progression of CRC by inhibiting CRC cells in terms of proliferation, invasion and migration, meanwhile up-regulating PD-L1 expression via inhibiting miR-570. The ZnC-anti-PD1 co-treatment assists in synergically increasing anti-tumor efficacy in CRC therapy.",

The sustained and externally triggered controlled release from these vehicles was demonstrated using a rotating Halbach magnet array, quantified via liquid chromatography, and imaged in situ using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In the absence of the external magnetic trigger, the carnosine was found to be released from the polymer in a linear profile; however, over 50% of the drug could be released within 30 minutes of exposure to the rotating magnetic field. In addition, the release of carnosine embedded on the surface of the nano-rods was delayed if it was mixed with the iron oxide nano rods before the encapsulation. These new drug delivery vesicles have the potential to pave the way towards the safe and triggered release of onsite drug delivery, as part of a theragnostic treatment for glioblastoma."

Injury to the spinal cord triggers a signaling cascade that results in activation of the inflammatory cascade, apoptosis, and Zn(II) ion homeostasis. Trehalose (Tre), a nonreducing disaccharide, and L-carnosine (Car), (β-alanyl-L-histidine), one of the endogenous histidine dipeptides have been recognized to suppress early inflammatory effects, oxidative stress and to possess neuroprotective effects. We report on the effects of the conjugation of Tre with Car (Tre-car) in reducing inflammation in in vitro and in vivo models. The in vitro study was performed using rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cell line). After 24 h, Tre-car, Car, Tre, and Tre + Car mixture treatments, cells were collected and used to investigate Zn2+ homeostasis. The in vivo model of SCI was induced by extradural compression of the spinal cord at the T6-T8 levels. After treatments with Tre, Car and Tre-Car conjugate 1 and 6 h after SCI, spinal cord tissue was collected for analysis. In vitro results demonstrated the ionophore effect and chelating features of L-carnosine and its conjugate. In vivo, the Tre-car conjugate treatment counteracted the activation of the early inflammatory cascade, oxidative stress and apoptosis after SCI. The Tre-car conjugate stimulated neurotrophic factors release, and influenced Zn2+ homeostasis. We demonstrated that Tre-car, Tre and Car treatments improved tissue recovery after SCI. Tre-car decreased proinflammatory, oxidative stress mediators release, upregulated neurotrophic factors and restored Zn2+ homeostasis, suggesting that Tre-car may represent a promising therapeutic agent for counteracting the consequences of SCI.",

DATA SYNTHESIS: Peripheral vascular disease is growing in its burden and impact; however it is currently under researched, and there are a lack of strong, non-invasive therapeutic options for the clinicians. Carnosine is a dipeptide stored particularly in muscle and brain tissue, which exhibits a wide range of physiological activities, which may be beneficial as an adjunct treatment for peripheral vascular disease. Carnosine's strong anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiglycating actions may aid in the prevention of plaque formation, through protective actions on the vascular endothelium, and the inhibition of foam cells. Carnosine may also improve angiogenesis, exercise performance and vasodilatory response, while protecting from ischemic tissue injury. CONCLUSIONS: Carnosine may have a role as an adjunct treatment for peripheral vascular disease alongside typical exercise and surgical interventions, and may be used in high risk individuals to aid in the prevention of atherogenesis. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION: This review identifies a beneficial role for carnosine supplementation in the management of patients with peripheral vascular disease, in conjunction with exercise and revascularization. Carnosine as a supplement is safe, and associated with a host of beneficial effects in peripheral vascular disease and its key risk factors.",

      "abstract": "Bronchial and pleural injuries with persistent air leak pose a threat in the repair and regeneration of pulmonary diseases. The need to arrive at a highly efficient therapy for closure of bronchopleural fistula (BPF) so as to effectively suppress inflammation, infection and repair the damaged pleural space caused by cancer as well as contractile restoration of bronchopleural scars remain a significant clinical challenge. Herein, we have designed and developed potent bioactive vitamin K3 carnosine peptide (VKC)-loaded spun SF fibroin fibers/collagen bi-layered 3D scaffold for bronchopleural fistula tissue engineering applications. The VKC drug showed excellent cell viability in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs), in addition to its pronounced higher cytotoxicity against the A549 lung cancer cell line with an IC50 of 5 μg/mL. Furthermore, VKC displayed a strong affinity with the catalytic site of EGFR (PDB ID: 1M17) and VEGFR2 (PDB ID: 4AGD, 4ASD) receptors in molecular docking studies. Following which the spun SF-VKC (primary layer) and collagen film (top layer) constructed bi-layered CSVKC were structurally elucidated and its morphological, physicochemical and biological characterizations were well examined. The bi-layered scaffold showed superior biocompatibility and cell migration ability in HBECs than other scaffolds. Interestingly, the CSVKC revealed rapid HBECs motility towards scratched regions for fast healing in vitro bronchial tissue engineering. In vivo biocompatibility and angiogenesis studies of the prepared scaffolds were evaluated and the results obtained demonstrated excellent new tissue formation and neovascularization in the bi-layered architecture rather than others. Therefore, our results suggest that the potent antibacterial and anticancer therapeutic agent (VKC)-impregnated silk fibroin fibers/collagen bi-layered 3D biomaterial could be useful in treating cancerous BPF and pulmonary diseases in future.",

      "abstract": "Carnosine is a dipeptide expressed in both the central nervous system and periphery. Several biological functions have been attributed to carnosine, including as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent, and as a modulator of mitochondrial metabolism. Some of these mechanisms have been implicated in the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical manifestation and recovery time for COVID-19 are variable. Some patients are severely affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection and may experience respiratory failure, thromboembolic disease, neurological symptoms, kidney damage, acute pancreatitis, and even death. COVID-19 patients with comorbidities, including diabetes, are at higher risk of death. Mechanisms underlying the dysfunction of the afflicted organs in COVID-19 patients have been discussed, the most common being the so-called cytokine storm. Given the biological effects attributed to carnosine, adjuvant therapy with this dipeptide could be considered as supportive treatment in patients with either COVID-19 or long COVID."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammation is known to underlie the pathogenesis in neuropathic pain. This study investigated the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective mechanisms involved in antinociceptive effects of co-administration of acetaminophen and L-carnosine in chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced peripheral neuropathy in male Wistar rats. METHODS: Fifty-six male Wistar rats were randomly divided into seven experimental groups (n = 8) treated with normal saline/acetaminophen/acetaminophen + L-carnosine. CCI was used to induce neuropathic pain in rats. Hyperalgesia and allodynia were assessed using hotplate and von Frey tests, respectively. Investigation of spinal proinflammatory cytokines and antioxidant system were carried out after twenty-one days of treatment. RESULTS: The results showed that the co-administration of acetaminophen and L-carnosine significantly (P < 0.001) increased the paw withdrawal threshold to thermal and mechanical stimuli in ligated rats compared to the ligated naïve group. There was a significant (P < 0.001) decrease in the levels of nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer B cell inhibitor, calcium ion, interleukin-1-beta, and tumour necrotic factor-alpha in the spinal cord of the group coadministered with acetaminophen and L-carnosine compared to the ligated control group. Co-administration with acetaminophen and L-carnosine increased the antioxidant enzymatic activities and reduced the lipid peroxidation in the spinal cord. CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of acetaminophen and L-carnosine has anti-inflammatory effects as a mechanism that mediate its antinociceptive effects in CCI-induced peripheral neuropathy in Wistar rat."

      "abstract": "The most common joint disease in the elderly is knee osteoarthritis (OA). It is distinguished by cartilage degradation, subchondral bone loss, and a decrease in joint space. We studied the effects of carnosine (CA) on knee OA in male Wistar rats. OA is induced by anterior cruciate ligament transection combined with medial meniscectomy (ACLT+MMx) method and in vitro studies are conducted in fibroblast-like synoviocyte cells (FLS). The pain was assessed using weight-bearing and paw-withdrawal tests. CA supplementation significantly reduced pain. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method was used to detect inflammatory proteins in the blood and intra-articular synovial fluid (IASF), and CA reduced the levels of inflammatory proteins. Histopathological studies were performed on knee-tissue samples using toluidine blue and hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) assays. CA treatment improved synovial protection and decreased cartilage degradation while decreasing zonal depth lesions. Furthermore, Western blotting studies revealed that the CA-treated group activated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase (HO-1) and reduced the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). FLS cells were isolated from the knee joints and treated with IL-1β to stimulate the inflammatory response and increase reactive oxygen species (ROS). The matrix metalloproteinase protein (MMP's) levels (MMP-3, and MMP-13) were determined using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and CA treatment reduced the MMP's expression levels. When tested using the 2',7'-dicholorodihydrofluroscene diacetate (DCFDA) assay and the 5,5',6,6'-tetracholoro-1,1',3,3'-tertraethylbenzimidazolcarboc janine iodide (JC-1) assay in augmented ROS FLS cells, CA reduced the ROS levels and improved the mitochondrial membrane permeability. This study's investigation suggests that CA significantly alleviates knee OA both in vitro and in vivo."

      "abstract": "Zinc L-carnosine is a pharmaceutical compound with direct mucosal cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory action through its antioxidative effects, cytokine modulation and membrane-stabilizing properties. Chemically, it is not an anti-secretory, antacid or raft-forming agent; its properties are mainly mediated by its higher affinity for damaged mucosa that permits the release of zinc locally by ligand exchange. Beneficial effects on various types of mucosal damage have been described in vitro and in vivo, in both animals and humans. It has been shown to promote repair of mucosal injury in human studies and has been widely used for the treatment of peptic ulcers, chemoradiotherapy-induced oral mucositis and esophagitis. More recently, the therapeutic applications of Zinc L-carnosine have been extended to the prevention and cure of various types of intestinal damage, including ulcerative colitis, iatrogenic ulcers after operative endoscopy, hemorrhoidal disease and impaired intestinal permeability. This review concentrates mainly on the current and future applications of zinc L-carnosine in gastrointestinal disease, and may be of use to gastroenterologists and endoscopists. It describes the therapeutic principles and benefits of this interesting molecule and discusses the potential future fields of interest for clinical use in humans.",

Carnosine or anserine was administered at a dose of 500 mg (∼2 mmol) per kilogram of mouse body weight, and ID contents in the tissues were measured. No ID were detected in untreated Carns-KO mice. In the ID treatment groups, the ID concentrations in the tissues increased in a time-dependent manner in the gastrocnemius muscle, soleus muscle, and cerebrum after ID administration. Our findings suggest that the Carns-KO mice are a valuable animal model for directly evaluating the effects of dietary ID and for elucidating the physiological functions of oral ID administration.",

Topical preparations are the first-line treatments, which are readily available as \"over-the-counter\" (OTC) products, often containing a nonstandardised mixture of \"natural\" remedies, or anaesthetics or cortisol;those latter are not free from undesirable effects. The Zinc-L-Carnosine is a cytoprotective compound, promoting mucosal repair in the gastrointestinal tract and also in mucosal repair, following radiation injuries to the rectum as well as in ulcerative colitis. Our aim was to study the efficacy of Zinc-L-Carnosine in relieving acute symptoms of HD, testing a preparation in the rectal ointment, Proctilor®, in patients complaining of bleeding or thrombosed piles. In a multicentre open trial, 21 patients older than 18 years of age were enrolled. The symptoms of HD were graded according to the Haemorrhoidal Disease Symptoms Score (HDSS) in association with the Short Health Scale (SHS) to assess the influence of HD on quality of life. The pain was assessed with the VAS score, bowel habit by means of the Bristol scale. The patients were evaluated at enrolment (T0) and 2 (T1) and 4 (T2) weeks of treatment with Proctilor® rectal ointment. There were 10 men and 11 women; mean age, 49 years. Pain, bleeding, and thrombosis were all significantly reduced after treatment; the mean VAS score decreased from 4.71 ± 3.05 at T0 to.52 ± 0.87 and.05 ± 0.22 at T1 and T2, respectively; (mean ± SD; p < 0.001 in both cases). Similarly, the HDSS score showed to be significantly reduced between T0, T1 (8.05 ± 4.55 vs. 1.14 ± 1.01), and T2 (8.05 ± 4.55 vs. 24 ± 0.44) (mean ± SD; p < 0.001 in both cases). Quality of life showed to be improved as the SHS score decreased significantly with treatment (7.90 ± 4.17 at T0 vs. 4.24 ± 0.44 at T1 vs. 4.05 ± 0.22 at T2; mean ± SD; p < 0.001 in both cases). The Bristol score of defecation remained substantially unchanged. No side effects or discontinuation of treatment were reported. Results of our investigation suggest a role of Proctilor® rectal ointment in treating symptomatic HD with good results and an excellent safety profile. However, our preliminary results encourage further studies on a larger number of patients to confirm the role of Zinc-L-Carnosine in the rectal ointment for the topical treatment of HD."

Study has shown that carnosine could ameliorate cognitive impairment in animal model with diabetes mellitus. However, the mechanism remains unclear. An animal model of type 2 diabetes (db/db mice) was used in this study. The animals were treated with 0.9% saline or carnosine (100 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. Morris water maze was tested after drug administration. Oxidative stress-related factors malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), and pro-inflammatory factors inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were measured. Synapse-related protein postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were detected by western blot. Besides, the expressions of sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), phospho-protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (P-PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme-1α (IRE1α), phospho-inositol-requiring enzyme-1α (P-IRE1α), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) in the hippocampus of the brain were detected. The results showed that treatment with carnosine ameliorated cognitive impairment in db/db mice. Carnosine reduced neuronal oxidative stress damage and iNOS expression in db/db mice. Meanwhile, carnosine relieved neurodegeneration in the hippocampus of db/db mice. Furthermore, carnosine promoted the expression of SIRT6 and reduced the expressions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related factors (BIP, P-PERK, P-IRE1α, ATF6, and CHOP). In conclusion, these data suggested that the protective effect of carnosine against DE might be related to SIRT6/ER stress pathway.",

In this study, 40 male Wistar rats aged 15 months were randomly assigned to a control or to two experimental groups in which 0.1% carnosine supplementation was performed for 10 or 34 weeks. After 34 weeks, we examined fast fatigable (FF), fast fatigue-resistant (FR) and slow (S) MUs' force properties and fatigability, as well as antioxidant potential, advanced glycation end products, activity of enzymes, and histidyl dipeptides content in the medial gastrocnemius muscle. Short- and long-term carnosine supplementation maintained the force of FF MUs at a higher level during its rapid decline seen from the initial 10 to 70 s of the fatigue test. In FF, especially long-term, and in FR MUs, especially short-term, carnosine supplementation resulted in less rapid force decline during the initial 70 s of the second fatigue protocol. Carnosine supplementation did not change muscle antioxidant potential and mortality rate (~35% in all groups), nor muscle mass with aging. Moreover, instead of the expected increase, a decrease in histidyl dipeptides by ~30% in the red portion of medial gastrocnemius muscle after long-term supplementation was found. After chronic carnosine supplementation, the specific changes in fatigue resistance were observed in FF and FR units, but not in S MU types that were not accompanied by an improvement of antioxidant potential and activity of glycolytic or oxidative enzymes in aged rats. These observations indicate that carnosine supplementation during aging may generate different physiological adaptations which should be considered as an important factor when planning treatment strategies.",

The levels of inflammatory factors, blood lipids, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), S-100β, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) of the two groups were determined and compared. The adverse effects and rebleeding of patients were recorded. The Barthel index (BI) was used to evaluate the quality of life of patients. RESULTS: The treatment efficiency in the observation group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.05). After treatment, the observation group obtained more favorable outcomes in terms of the neurological and motor functions, lesions of brain edema and cerebral infarction, and BI scores, than those of the control group (all P<0.05). In addition, after treatment, the levels of inflammatory factors, blood lipids, NSE, S-100β, MMP-9, plasma viscosity, and whole blood viscosity of the two groups of patients all decreased remarkably, with better outcomes in the observation group when compared with the control group (all P<0.05). The observation group showed a markedly lower rebleeding rate than the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: For patients with hemorrhagic cerebral infarction, the triple therapy of carnosine glycoside, edaravone, and Xueshuantong effectively enhances the neurological and motor function, reduces cerebral edema and cerebral infarction, and improves the quality of life, with high safety."

However, reports on the effects of L-carnosine in humans have been inconsistent, and the efficacy of L-carnosine supplementation for improving ASD symptoms has yet to be investigated in animal studies. Here, we examined the effects of oral supplementation with L-carnosine on social deficits in CD157KO mice, a murine model of ASD. Social deficits in CD157KO mice were assessed using a three-chamber social approach test. Oral supplementation with L-carnosine attenuated social behavioral deficits. The number of c-Fos-positive oxytocin neurons in the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus was increased with L-carnosine supplementation in CD157KO mice after the three-chamber social approach test. We observed an increase in the number of c-Fos-positive neurons in the basolateral amygdala, a brain region involved in social behavior. Although the expression of oxytocin and oxytocin receptors in the hypothalamus was not altered by L-carnosine supplementation, the concentration of oxytocin in cerebrospinal fluid was increased in CD157KO mice by L-carnosine supplementation. These results suggest that L-carnosine supplementation restores social recognition impairments by augmenting the level of released oxytocin. Thus, we could imply the possibility of a safe nutritional intervention for at least some types of ASD in the human population.",

To investigate the mechanism of action of carnosine on human skin proteome, a 3D scaffold-free spheroid model of primary dermal fibroblasts from a 50-year-old donor was adopted in combination with quantitative proteomics for the first time. The label free proteomics approach based on high-resolution mass spectrometry, integrated with network analyses, provided a highly sensitive and selective method to describe the human dermis spheroid model during long-term culture and upon carnosine treatment. Overall, 2171 quantified proteins allowed the in-depth characterization of the 3D dermis phenotype during growth and differentiation, at 14 versus 7 days of culture. A total of 485 proteins were differentially regulated by carnosine at 7 days, an intermediate time of culture. Of the several modulated pathways, most are involved in mitochondrial functionality, such as oxidative phosphorylation, TCA cycle, extracellular matrix reorganization and apoptosis. In long-term culture, functional modules related to oxidative stress were upregulated, inducing the aging process of dermis spheroids, while carnosine treatment prevented this by the downregulation of the same functional modules. The application of quantitative proteomics, coupled to advanced and relevant in vitro scaffold free spheroids, represents a new concrete application for personalized therapies and a novel care approach.",

The conventional triple therapy (TT) is becoming obsolete with a high failure rate of eradication, necessitating the need for better alternatives or regimens. AIM: To investigate H. pylori eradication rate of TT vs modified bismuth quadruple therapy. METHODS: Ninety-two patients with dyspepsia symptoms and positive 13C-urea breath test were randomly assigned to two groups. The first group (control group) was treated for 14 d using standard TT protocol: Esomeprazole (40 mg twice daily), amoxicillin (1 g twice daily) and clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily). On the other hand, the second group was prescribed a 10-d course of modified bismuth quadruple therapy fortified with zinc carnosine: TT in addition to bismuth subcitrate (240 mg twice daily) and zinc carnosine (75 mg twice daily). A repeated 13C-urea breath test was done 4 wk after the completion of the eradication therapy. RESULTS: Among the 92 subjects, 67.4% were males and 32.6% were females. There were no differences in demographic characteristics (age, body mass index, smoking history, previous antibiotics use and ethnicity) between the modified bismuth quadruple therapy group and TT group. The eradication rate was higher [93.5% (43/46)] in the modified bismuth quadruple therapy group compared to 69.6% (32/46) in the standard TT group (P = 0.003). Of the tested predictor variables, only nationality, smoking and therapy type were statistically significant. Besides dizziness, which was recorded in modified bismuth quadruple therapy group, there were no significant differences in side effects between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Ten days of modified bismuth quadruple therapy fortified with zinc carnosine is superior to 14 d of conventional TT in eradicating H. pylori infection, with no additional significant adverse events."

Dynamic multistate life table models were constructed in order to estimate both clinical outcomes and costs of Australians aged 18 years and above with and without type 2 diabetes over a ten-year period, 2020 to 2029. The dynamic nature of the model allowed for population change over time (migration and deaths) and accounted for the development of new cases of diabetes. The three health states were 'Alive without type 2 diabetes', 'Alive with type 2 diabetes' and 'Dead'. Transition probabilities, costs, and utilities were obtained from published sources. The main outcome of interest was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of cost per year of life saved (YoLS) and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Over the ten-year period, the addition of carnosine to standard care treatment resulted in ICERs (discounted) of AUD 34,836 per YoLS and AUD 43,270 per QALY gained. Assuming the commonly accepted willingness to pay threshold of AUD 50,000 per QALY gained, supplemental dietary carnosine may be a cost-effective treatment option for people with type 2 diabetes in Australia.",

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of carnosine on the cell proliferation of human colorectal cancer cells. After human colorectal cancer HCT-116 cells were treated carnosine for 72 or 96 h, the cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, necroptosis, angiogenesis and the expression of related regulatory molecules were detected using MTT assays, fluorescence image analysis and RT-qPCR in this study. Treatment of HCT-116 cells with 5, 10 or 15 mM carnosine for 72 or 96 h significantly decreased cell viability (P<0.05). The mRNA expression of β-catenin and transcription factor 4 (Tcf-4) was significantly reduced by 15-23% and 11-80%, respectively (P<0.05). When HCT-116 cells were treated with 15 mM carnosine, the mRNA levels of 1A/1B-light chain 3 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase were significantly increased by 235% and 249%, respectively (P<0.05). The mRNA level of Beclin-1 and autophagy levels were significantly increased by 137-141% in HCT-116 cells treated with 5, 10 or 15 mM carnosine (P<0.05). Carnosine (15 mM) also increased reactive oxygen species levels and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein mRNA expression and depleted ATP levels (P<0.05). The angiogenesis-regulating molecules vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor receptor and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α were all significantly decreased by 10 or 15 mM carnosine treatment. These results showed that carnosine could suppress human colorectal cell proliferation by reducing β-catenin/Tcf-4 signaling, inducing autophagy and necroptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis. It was demonstrated that carnosine is a potential compound from dietary food for the future clinical treatment and/or prevention of colorectal cancer."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease driven by sustained inflammation in the central nervous system. One of the pathological hallmarks of MS is extensive free radical production. However, the subsequent generation, potential pathological role, and detoxification of different lipid peroxidation-derived reactive carbonyl species during neuroinflammation are unclear, as are the therapeutic benefits of carbonyl quenchers. Here, we investigated the reactive carbonyl acrolein and (the therapeutic effect of) acrolein quenching by carnosine during neuroinflammation. METHODS: The abundance and localization of acrolein was investigated in inflammatory lesions of MS patients and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. In addition, we analysed carnosine levels and acrolein quenching by endogenous and exogenous carnosine in EAE. Finally, the therapeutic effect of exogenous carnosine was assessed in vivo (EAE) and in vitro (primary mouse microglia, macrophages, astrocytes). RESULTS: Acrolein was substantially increased in inflammatory lesions of MS patients and EAE mice. Levels of the dipeptide carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine), an endogenous carbonyl quencher particularly reactive towards acrolein, and the carnosine-acrolein adduct (carnosine-propanal) were ~ twofold lower within EAE spinal cord tissue. Oral carnosine treatment augmented spinal cord carnosine levels (up to > tenfold), increased carnosine-acrolein quenching, reduced acrolein-protein adduct formation, suppressed inflammatory activity, and alleviated clinical disease severity in EAE. In vivo and in vitro studies indicate that pro-inflammatory microglia/macrophages generate acrolein, which can be efficiently quenched by increasing carnosine availability, resulting in suppressed inflammatory activity. Other properties of carnosine (antioxidant, nitric oxide scavenging) may also contribute to the therapeutic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify carbonyl (particularly acrolein) quenching by carnosine as a therapeutic strategy to counter inflammation and macromolecular damage in MS.",

AKI in Albino rats was induced by cecal ligation and puncture surgery where as TNF-α and IL-1β levels were detected using ELISA assay. Protein expression was examined by western blotting and pathological damage using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Treatment with carnosine suppressed AKI induced urea nitrogen and creatinine in Male Albino rat serum in dose-dependent manner. Development of sepsis mediated renal injury in Albino rats was also effectively prevented on treatment with carnosine. Secretion of AKI-induced IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α in renal tissues was alleviated significantly in Albino rats by carnosine treatment. Additionally, in carnosine-treated Albino rats renal tissues AKI induced Bax expression was alleviated while as Bcl-2 was promoted compared to AKI Albino rats. Carnosine treatment improved the survival rate of the Albino rats with AKI. Carnosine inhibits renal tissue damage and increases survival rate in AKI Albino rat model. The mechanism involves alleviation of inflammatory cytokine secretion and promotion of Bcl-2 expression. Thus, carnosine may be used as a therapeutic agent for treatment of AKI."

      "abstract": "Muscle weakness and fatigue are primary manifestations of multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic disease of the central nervous system. Interventions that enhance muscle function may improve overall physical well-being of MS patients. Recently, we described that levels of carnosine, an endogenous muscle dipeptide involved in contractile function and fatigue-resistance, are reduced in muscle tissue from MS patients and a monophasic rodent MS model (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, EAE). In the present study, we aimed to (1) confirm this finding in a chronic EAE model, along with the characterization of structural and functional muscle alterations, and (2) investigate the effect of carnosine supplementation to increase/restore muscle carnosine levels and improve muscle function in EAE. We performed muscle immunohistochemistry and ex vivo contractility measurements to examine muscle structure and function at different stages of EAE, and following nutritional intervention (oral carnosine: 3, 15 or 30 g/L in drinking water). Immunohistochemistry revealed progressively worsening muscle fiber atrophy and a switch towards a fast-twitch muscle phenotype during EAE. Using ex vivo muscle contractility experiments, we observed reductions in muscle strength and contraction speed, but no changes in muscle fatigability of EAE mice. However, carnosine levels were unaltered during all stages of EAE, and even though oral carnosine supplementation dose-dependently increased muscle carnosine levels up to + 94% after 56 days EAE, this did not improve muscle function of EAE mice. In conclusion, EAE mice display significant, yet time-dependent, muscular alterations, and carnosine intervention does not improve muscle function in EAE.",

      "abstract": "Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is rapidly gaining appreciation for its pathophysiologic role in cardiac injury and failure. Oxidative deamination of norepinephrine by MAO generates H2O2 and the catecholaldehyde 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL), the latter of which is a highly potent and reactive electrophile that has been linked to cardiotoxicity. However, many questions remain as to whether catecholaldehydes regulate basic physiological processes in the myocardium and the pathways involved. Here, we examined the role of MAO-derived oxidative metabolites in mediating the activation of cardiac fibroblasts in response to norepinephrine. In neonatal murine cardiac fibroblasts, norepinephrine increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), accumulation of catechol-modified protein adducts, expression and secretion of collagens I/III, and other markers of profibrotic activation including STAT3 phosphorylation. These effects were attenuated with MAO inhibitors, the aldehyde-scavenging dipeptide l-carnosine, and FPS-ZM1, an antagonist for the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE). Interestingly, treatment of cardiac fibroblasts with a low dose (1 μM) of DOPEGAL-modified albumin phenocopied many of the effects of norepinephrine and also induced an increase in RAGE expression. Higher doses (>10 μM) of DOPEGAL-modified albumin were determined to be toxic to cardiac fibroblasts in a RAGE-dependent manner, which was mitigated by l-carnosine. Collectively, these findings suggest that norepinephrine may influence extracellular matrix remodeling via an adrenergic-independent redox pathway in cardiac fibroblasts involving the MAO-mediated generation of ROS, catecholaldehydes, and RAGE. Furthermore, since elevations in the catecholaminergic tone and oxidative stress in heart disease are linked with cardiac fibrosis, this study illustrates novel drug targets that could potentially mitigate this serious disorder.",

A previous study produced KRC breast meat containing high carnosine content through dietary supplementation with β-alanine or L-histidine; however, the KRC that were fed an L-histidine-supplemented diet produced meat that was significantly more tender. Herein, we performed RNA-Seq to identify candidate genes involved in the regulation of carnosine content and meat toughness. Total RNA was isolated from five female KRC breast muscles in each treatment group that KRC fed diets without supplementation, supplemented with β-alanine or L-histidine. Compared to the non-supplemented group, we identified 118 and 198 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the β-alanine or L-histidine supplementation groups, respectively. Genes potentially related to meat tenderness-i.e., those regulating myosin, collagen, intramuscular fat, and calpain-were upregulated (LOC107051274, ACSBG1, and CAPNS2) and downregulated (MYO7B, MYBPH, SERPINH1, and PGAM1). However, carnosine synthase gene was not identified. Functional enrichment analysis identified pathways affected by dietary supplementation, including the insulin signaling pathway (β-alanine supplementation) and the insulin resistance and adipocytokine signaling pathways (L-histidine supplementation). The FoxO signaling pathway was identified as a regulatory network for both supplementation groups. The identified genes can be used as molecular markers of meat tenderness in slow-growing chickens."

Quantitation of carnosine and its analogs in biological matrices results to be crucial for these applications and HPLC-MS procedures with isotope-labeled internal standards are the state-of-the-art approach for this analytical need. The use of these standards allows to account for variations during the sample preparation process, between-sample matrix effects, and variations in instrument performance over analysis time. Although literature reports a number of studies involving carnosine, isotope-labeled derivatives of the dipeptide are not commercially available. In this work we present a fast, flexible, and convenient strategy for the synthesis of the 13C-labeled carnosine analogs and their application as internal standards for the quantitation of carnosine and anserine in a biological matrix.",

      "abstract": "Monoamine oxidase (MAO) catalyzes the oxidative deamination of dopamine and norepinephrine to produce 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL), respectively. Both of these aldehydes are potently cytotoxic and have been implicated in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and cardiometabolic disorders. Previous work has demonstrated that both the catechol and aldehyde moieties of DOPAL are reactive and cytotoxic via their propensity to cause macromolecular cross-linking. With certain amines, DOPAL likely reacts via a Schiff base before oxidative activation of the catechol and rearrangement to a stable indole product. Our current work expands on this reactivity and includes the less-studied DOPEGAL. Although we confirmed that antioxidants mediated DOPAL's reactivity with carnosine and N-acetyl-l-lysine, antioxidants had no effect on reactivity with l-cysteine. Therefore, we propose a non-oxidative mechanism where, following Schiff base formation, the thiol of l-cysteine reacts to form a thiazolidine. Similarly, we demonstrate that DOPEGAL forms a putative thiazolidine conjugate with l-cysteine. We identified and characterized both l-cysteine conjugates via HPLC-MS and additionally identified a DOPEGAL adduct with carnosine, which is likely an Amadori product. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that these conjugates are produced in biological systems via MAO after treatment of the cell lysate with norepinephrine or dopamine along with the corresponding nucleophiles (i.e., l-cysteine and carnosine). As it has been established that metabolic and oxidative stress leads to increased MAO activity and accumulation of DOPAL and DOPEGAL, it is conceivable that conjugation of these aldehydes to carnosine or l-cysteine is a newly identified detoxification pathway. Furthermore, the ability to characterize these adducts via analytical techniques reveals their potential for use as biomarkers of dopamine or norepinephrine metabolic disruption.",

Polydatin (PD), a natural product isolated from Polygonum cuspidatum, is known to have an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic effect. We attempted to compare the protective impact of PD pretreatment on alterations to the intestinal epithelial barrier and the colonic wall's ultrastructure accompanying ulcerative colitis to other conventional drugs in practice, primarily L-carnosine, which has not been addressed before. The rats were divided into 5 groups; 3 of them were treated with sulphasalazine (500 mg/kg), L-carnosine (30 mg/kg), and PD (45 mg/kg). All groups were administered their respective drugs 3 days before the UC was induced by acetic acid intra-rectally, and the treatment was continued until the 11th day. The disease activity index (DAI) was estimated, and a macroscopic scoring was established for the harvested colonic tissue. The tissues were extracted and processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining, caspase-3 immunohistochemical staining, electron microscopy, and biochemical analysis evaluating proinflammatory markers (IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6), myeloperoxidase (MPO), oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation. Histopathological examination of colonic tissue showed that PD pretreatment effectively restored mucosal epithelial cells, intercellular tight junctions, goblet cells, and maintained the intestinal epithelial and endothelial barriers. PD suppressed MPO, proinflammatory markers, and malondialdehyde but enhanced superoxide dismutase and glutathione levels. It also hampered apoptosis, as evidenced by a reduction in caspase-3 expression. PD showed a significantly better response in preserving the intestinal epithelial barrier against acetic acid-induced colitis as compared to sulphasalazine and L-carnosine. These findings demonstrate the therapeutic role of PD for patients with UC.",

A two-factor design was adopted in this study. A total of 640 1-day-old male broilers were assigned to eight treatments with factorial arrangement containing four levels of l-histidine (0, 650, 1300, or 1950 mg/kg) and two levels of beta-alanine (0 or 1200 mg/kg) supplementation; 0 mg/kg histidine and/or 0 mg/kg were treated as control groups. Each treatment including eight replicates with 10 birds each and the feeding trial lasted for 42 days. Dietary supplementation with l-histidine and beta-alanine did not affect average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of broilers during the grower (22-42 days) and the entire phase (1-42 days), compared with the control group (p > 0.05). The only exception was a significantly reduced ADG in the 1950 mg/kg l-histidine group in the starter period (1-21 days, p < 0.05). l-Histidine at 1950 mg/kg significantly decreased redness (a*) and yellowness (b*) values of the meat at 45 min postmortem (p < 0.05), whereas it increased b* value and pH in breast muscle at 24 h postmortem. Moreover, dietary supplementation with beta-alanine alone or combination with l-histidine significantly increased ΔpH in breast muscle (p < 0.01). Dietary l-histidine markedly increased total superoxide dismutase activity and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) both in breast muscle (p < 0.01) and in plasma (p < 0.01), and it decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in breast muscle (p < 0.01). Dietary addition of beta-alanine, alone or combination, significantly increased T-AOC in breast muscle (p < 0.01) and markedly decreased MDA content both in breast muscle and in plasma (p < 0.01). Addition of l-histidine and beta-alanine significantly increased muscle peptide (carnosine and anserine) content (p < 0.05) and upregulated the expression of carnosine synthase, transporter of carnosine/ l-histidine, and l-histidine decarboxylase genes (p < 0.05), with greater change occurring in the combination group of 1300 mg/kg l-histidine and 1200 mg/kg beta-alanine. Overall, dietary l-histidine and beta-alanine could improve meat quality and antioxidant capacity, enhance the carnosine and anserine content, and upregulate the gene expression of carnosine synthesis-related enzymes in broilers."

      "abstract": "Background Horizontal neck wrinkle formation is gaining more attention among cosmetic practitioners and clients. To date, hyaluronic acid products are one of the most common treatment options for this aesthetic concern. However, different therapeutic strategies should be given to solve the problem due to multiple etiological reasons. Given that oxidative damage plays a critical role in neck wrinkle formation, anti-oxidative compounds are now considered by physicians when making a treatment plan. Aims To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a non-cross-linked hyaluronic acid filler in combination with L-carnosine in treating horizontal neck wrinkles. Methods Thirteen patients with a Wrinkle Assessment Scale (WAS) of 2-5 for horizontal neck wrinkles were treated with L-carnosine-containing non-cross-linked hyaluronic acid. Participants were followed-up for 3 months after treatment. The post-treated WAS scores evaluated by physicians were collected when patient satisfaction was surveyed. Any post-treatment adverse events were recorded. Results With a single injection of the above filler, the physician-evaluated WAS scores improved by at least one score at one month and the improvement kept consistent as far as three months after injection. According to the last follow-up visit, 11/13 patients were satisfied with the treatment effect of their neck wrinkle. Moreover, adverse events were rare after filler injection, except for local complications that were considered common reactions to the filler injection procedure. Conclusion The non-cross-linked hyaluronic acid filler containing L-carnosine is safe and effective for treating horizontal neck wrinkles.Level of Evidence IV This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

      "abstract": "Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. However, treatment options for ischemic stroke remain limited. Matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to brain damage during ischemic strokes by disrupting the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and causing brain edemas. Carnosine, an endogenous dipeptide, was found by us and others to be protective against ischemic brain injury. In this study, we investigated whether carnosine influences MMP activity. Brain MMP levels and activity were measured by gelatin zymography after permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (pMCAO) in rats and in vitro enzyme assays. Carnosine significantly reduced infarct volume and edema. Gelatin zymography and in vitro enzyme assays showed that carnosine inhibited brain MMPs. We showed that carnosine inhibited both MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity by chelating zinc. Carnosine also reduced the ischemia-mediated degradation of the tight junction proteins that comprise the BBB. In summary, our findings show that carnosine inhibits MMP activity by chelating zinc, an essential MMP co-factor, resulting in the reduction of edema and brain injury. We believe that our findings shed new light on the neuroprotective mechanism of carnosine against ischemic brain damage.",

      "abstract": "The study of the relationship between hematopoiesis and metabolism is now particularly relevant in view of the high incidence of alimentary dependent diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In this regard, pathogenetic factors of this disease development are studied actively in order to choose adequate drug therapy and usage of bioactive substances with antioxidant properties. The aim of the study was to study the pathogenetic relationship of hematological disorders and imbalance of growth factors, leptin and ghrelin in male Wistar rats in the model of the initial stage of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease development and to assess the regulatory effect of minor bioactive substances - carnosine and α-lipoic acid. Material and methods. The studies were performed on male Wistar rats with initial body weight 150±10 g within 8 weeks. Animals were divided into 5 groups (n=8 in each). Rats of the control group received a complete modified diet AIN93M, in which soybean oil was replaced with sunflower oil and lard (1:1). Rats of the experimental groups consumed high-calorie choline-deficient diet (HCCDD), in which fat content was 45%, fructose content - 20% of the energy value of the diet. Rats of the 2nd group were fed HCCDD without any supplements, the 3rd group - with the addition of carnosine (75 mg/kg body weight), the 4th group - with the addition of α-lipoic acid (75 mg/kg body weight), the 5th group - with the combined addition of carnosine and α-lipoic acid in a total dose of 150 mg/kg body weight. Hematological values were determined on a hematological analyzer. The content of ghrelin and leptin, as well as growth factors GM-CSF and M-CSF in blood plasma and adipose tissue lysates, was determined by multiplex immunoassay using xMAP technology. Results. Rat intake of HCCDD resulted in decreased hemoglobin levels and red blood cell scores compared to controls. Diet enrichment with carnosine and α-lipoic acid did not have a reliable effect on these indicators. Carnosine intake had a protective effect on erythrocyte volume, a decrease of which was recorded in other experimental groups. HCCDD stimulated the growth of the absolute number of leukocytes in peripheral blood due to granulocytes and mononuclears. The enrichment of HCCDD with carnosine and α-lipoic acid led to a further increase in leukocytosis, the maximum level of which was observed in the group of rats fed HCCDD, simultaneously enriched with carnosine and α-lipoic acid (14.86±1.48×109/l compared to 8.67±1.23×109/l in control). All diets used in the research had no effect on the number of erythrocytes and platelets in the peripheral blood of rats. The use of both HCCDD alone and in combination with carnosine or α-lipoic acid intake had a negative effect on the level of growth factors GM-CSF and M-CSF in blood plasma and adipose tissue. The consumption of HCCDD caused an increase in leptin blood level (8.54±0.69 compared to 2.58±0.37 pg/ml in control, р<0.05), which was normalized by enriching the diet with carnosine and α-lipoic acid. Ghrelin blood level significantly decreased in all experimental groups compared to the control: by 30% in rats fed and by almost 50% when carnosine and α-lipoic acid were added to HCCDD. The intake of α-lipoic acid led to hormone level changes in adipose tissue lysates, leptin content decreased (2.31±0.11 vs 2.77±0.15 pg/ml), while ghrelin level significantly increased (0.35±0.14 vs 0.20±0.06 pg/ml), compared with the control group (р<0.05). Conclusion. The revealed interrelation of parameters of the cellular composition of peripheral blood and hemoglobin content with the changes in the content of GM-CSF, M-CSF, leptin and ghrelin in blood plasma and adipose tissue indicates the mutual influence of the studied CSF, leptin, ghrelin and added antioxidants (carnosine and α-lipoic acid) on the regulatory mechanisms of hematopoiesis in rats fed HCCDD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Activation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathway is a significant contributor to the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Carnosine is a dipeptide that can inhibit TGF-β synthesis. We tested the hypothesis that carnosine supplement added to standard therapy will result in reduced urinary TGF-β levels among patients with diabetic nephropathy. METHODS: We randomly assigned 40 patients with diabetic nephropathy and albuminuria 30-299 mg/day to treatment with carnosine (2 g/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. Urinary TGF-β level was determined using ELISA, urine albumin was ascertained by immunonephelometric assay, and renal function and metabolic profiles were determined at baseline and during 12 weeks of active treatment. Primary outcome was decrease in urinary levels of TGF-β. RESULTS: The 2 groups were comparable for baseline characteristics, blood pressure, urine albumin, urine TGF-β and renal function measurements. Urinary TGF-β significantly decreased with carnosine supplement (- 17.8% of the baseline values), whereas it tended to increase with placebo (+ 16.9% of the baseline values) (between-group difference P < 0.05). However, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate and other biochemical parameters remained unchanged during the study period including urinary albuminuria. Both groups were well tolerated with no serious side-effects. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicated an additional renoprotective effect of oral supplementation with carnosine to decrease urinary TGF-β level that serves as a marker of renal injury in diabetic nephropathy.

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder. Early symptoms include motor dysfunction and impaired olfaction. Toxic aggregation of α-synuclein (aSyn) in the olfactory bulb (OB) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) is a hallmark of PD neuropathology. Intranasal (IN) carnosine (2 mg/d for 8 weeks) was previously demonstrated to improve motor behavior and mitochondrial function in Thy1-aSyn mice, a model of PD. The present studies evaluated the efficacy of IN carnosine at a higher dose in slowing progression of motor deficits and aSyn accumulation in Thy1-aSyn mice. After baseline neurobehavioral assessments, IN carnosine was administered (0.0, 2.0, or 4.0 mg/day) to wild-type and Thy1-aSyn mice for 8 weeks. Olfactory and motor behavioral measurements were repeated prior to end point tissue collection. Brain sections were immunostained for aSyn and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Immunopositive cells were counted using design-based stereology in the SNpc and OB mitral cell layer (MCL). Behavioral assessments revealed a dose-dependent improvement in motor function with increasing carnosine dose. Thy1-aSyn mice treated with 2.0 or 4.0 mg/d IN carnosine exhibited fewer aSyn-positive (aSyn(+)) cell bodies in the SNpc compared to vehicle-treated mice. Moreover, the number of aSyn(+) cell bodies in carnosine-treated Thy1-aSyn mice was reduced to vehicle-treated wild-type levels in the SNpc. Carnosine treatment did not affect the number of aSyn(+) cell bodies in the OB-MCL or the number of TH(+) cells in the SNpc. In summary, intranasal carnosine treatment decreased aSyn accumulation in the SNpc, which may underlie its mitigation of motor deficits in the Thy1-aSyn mice.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the implications of L-carnosine on interleukin-1α (IL-1α)-induced inflammation of lacrimal glands (LGs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty rabbits were divided equally into four groups: control group (G1), IL-1α (G2), L-carnosine (G3), and L-carnosine plus IL-1α (G4). Several clinical, histopathological, immunohistochemical, morphometric, and biochemical investigations were performed, followed by statistical analysis to diagnose the presence of dry eye disease (DED). RESULTS: The LGs of G2 rabbits showed degeneration of the acinar cells, increased deposition of collagen fibers, and marked immunoexpression of FasL; elevated levels of interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-β1, and malondialdehyde; and decreased levels of glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and reactive oxygen species compared with those of G1 rabbits. In contrast, administration of L-carnosine to G4 rabbits revealed marked improvement of all previously harmful changes in G2 rabbits, indicating the cytoprotective effects of L-carnosine against IL-1α-induced inflammation of LGs. CONCLUSIONS: IL-1α induced inflammation of LGs and eye dryness via oxidative stress, proinflammatory, apoptotic, and profibrotic effects, whereas L-carnosine mitigated DED through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and antifibrotic effects on LGs. Therefore, this work demonstrates for the first time that L-carnosine may be used as adjuvant therapy for the preservation of visual integrity in patients with DED.HighlightsIL-1α induced dry eye disease through its oxidative stress, proinflammatory, apoptotic and profibrotic effects on the lacrimal glands of rabbit.L-carnosine has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic and antifibrotic effects.L-carnosine mitigated IL-1α induced dry eye disease via elevating the levels of FasL, IFN-γ, TNF-α, TGFβ1 and MDA as well as reducing the levels of antioxidants (GPx, SOD, and catalase) and ROS in the lacrimal glands of rabbit.L-carnosine could be used as a novel adjuvant therapy for the treatment of dry eye disease.",

      "abstract": "Biobased processes to minimize environmental pollutants have attracted much attention. l-Carnosine has been produced by chemical synthesis, and as an alternative to this method, we newly developed engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum synthesizing l-carnosine. To develop the strain, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) was enhanced by attenuating flux to nonoxidative PPP. Enhanced PPP strengthened the histidine pathway and produced 5.0 g/L l-histidine and 3.9 mg/L l-carnosine. Then, the histidine synthetic pathway was reinforced by overexpressing HisG and Rel. This pathway reduced feedback inhibition by l-histidine and strengthened the flux of the histidine pathway; thus, it produced 552.20 mg/g DCW l-histidine. As a result, enhancement of the PPP accumulates more l-histidine than the histidine pathway; thus, the PPP was further enhanced by pgi gene alteration. For sufficient β-alanine products, PanD was overexpressed and produced 99.17 mg/L l-carnosine. The final strain, Car15, which consolidated all three pathways, produced 323.26 mg/L l-carnosine via fed-batch fermentation. Finally, we confirmed the antioxidant and antiglycation effects of biologically synthesized l-carnosine, and the biologically synthesized l-carnosine showed inhibitory activity similar to that of commercial l-carnosine. Consequently, this study suggested a new biosynthetic process for l-carnosine and showed potential as a treatment for metabolic disorders through the assessment of its functions.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Carnosine, an over the counter food supplement, has been shown to improve glucose metabolism as well as cardiovascular risk factors in animal and human studies through its anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antiglycating and chelating properties. The aim of this study is to establish if carnosine supplementation improves obesity, insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, cardiovascular risk factors including arterial stiffness and endothelial function, and other risk factors related to diabetes and cardiovascular disease in the overweight and obese population. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Fifty participants will be recruited to be enrolled in a double-blind randomised controlled trial. Eligible participants with a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 40 kg/m2 will be randomly assigned to the intervention or placebo group. Following a medical review and oral glucose tolerance test to check eligibility, participants will then undergo testing. At baseline, participants will have anthropometric measurements (BMI, dual X-ray absorptiometry and peripheral quantitative CT scan), measurements of glucose metabolism (oral glucose tolerance test, intravenous glucose tolerance test and euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp), cardiovascular measurements (central blood pressure, endothelial function and arterial stiffness), a muscle and fat biopsy, physical activity measurement, liver fibroscan, cognitive function and questionnaires to assess dietary habits, sleep quality, depression, and quality of life. Following baseline assessments, participants will be randomised to either 2 g carnosine or placebo for 15 weeks. In the 15th week, all assessments will be repeated. The preplanned outcome metric is the change between baseline and follow-up measures. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Monash Health and Monash University, Australia. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02686996.",
