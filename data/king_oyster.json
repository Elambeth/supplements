      "abstract": "Ginkgo biloba is widely planted as a colorful foliage tree, and its leaf can be used as a biomass energy source, but it has been underutilized for a long time. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of garden waste as a substrate component in the cultivation process of the king oyster mushroom (Pleurotus eryngii), with the goal of enhancing both the yield of P. eryngii and the efficiency of energy use. The percentages of G. biloba leaf powder in the substrate were 10.5% and 21% to replace sawdust or sugarcane bagasse in a typical substrate. A substrate formulation that could completely replace sawdust and sugarcane bagasse was selected by analyzing mycelial growth rate, days of production, fruiting body length, biological efficiency, yield, stipe thickness, pileus diameter and laccase activity. The results showed that Y1 (treatment with 21% G. biloba leaf powder and sugarcane bagasse) had the highest yield (303.1 ± 31.9 g), which was higher than that of CK (control) (259.3 ± 37.4 g). The crude fiber content of the samples grown on substrate Y1 (as 7.43%) was higher than CK (7.37%). In addition, P. eryngii grown on substrate Y1 had the highest laccase activity for the complete colonization of the mycelium. Thus, these findings suggest that G. biloba leaf powder represents a viable and economical supplement for enhancing both the yield and quality of P. eryngii."

This study investigated the effects of phytic acid alone (Treatment-1) or combined with glutathione (Treatment-2) on inhibiting browning and oxidation resistance of King Oyster mushroom (Pleurotus eryngii) slices during drying and storage. In King Oyster mushroom slices, 0.08% phytic acid combined with 0.1% glutathione inhibited the PPO activity by 97.6%, suppressed browning by 78.09% after 6 h of drying at 60 °C and inhibited browning by 69.93% and oxidation by 78.75% after 12 months of storage at ∼ 20 °C. Results indicated that using phytic acid combined with glutathione may inhibit browning and suppress the oxidation of King Oyster mushroom slices during drying and storage."

      "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX), a broad spectrum chemotherapeutic, has toxic effects on healthy tissues. Mitochondrial processes and oxidative stress act in the DOX-induced toxicity, therefore antioxidant therapies are widely used. The study was aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Pleurotus eryngii extract (PEE), an extract of a fungus with antioxidant properties, against DOX-induced lung damage. Rats were divided into Control, DOX, DOX + PEE, and PEE groups (n = 6). DOX was administered intraperitoneally in a single dose (10 mg/kg BW) and PE (200 mg/kg BW) was administered by oral gavage every other day for 21 days. Histopathological evaluations, immunohistochemical analyses, total oxidant status (TOS)/total antioxidant status (TAS) method, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis were performed. DOX led to severe histopathological disruptions in rat lungs. Also, DOX remarkably increased the expression of dynamin 1 like (DRP1) and decreased the expression of mitofusin 1 (MFN1) and mitofusin 2 (MFN2) genes, which are related to mitochondrial dynamics. Moreover, DOX caused an increase in TOS/ TAS and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels. On the other hand, PEE treatment remarkably normalized the histopathological findings, mitochondrial dynamics-related gene expressions, markers of oxidative stress, and DNA damage. The present study signs out that PEE can ameliorate the DOX-mediated lung toxicity and the antioxidant mechanism associated with mitochondrial dynamics can have a role in this potent therapeutic effect.",

      "abstract": "Pleurotus eryngii (king oyster mushroom) is a renowned culinary mushroom with various medicinal properties that may be beneficial for health maintenance and disease prevention. However, its effect on the nervous system remains elusive. In this study, hot water (PE-HWA) and ethanol (PE-ETH) extracts of P. eryngii were investigated and compared for their neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and neurite outgrowth activities in vitro. Based on the results, both extracts up to 400 μg/mL were nontoxic to PC12 cells and BV2 microglia (p > 0.05). Treatment with 250 μM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) markedly (p < 0.0001) reduced the PC12 cell viability to 67.74 ± 6.47%. Coincubation with 200 μg/mL and 400 μg/mL of PE-ETH dose-dependently increased the cell viability to 85.34 ± 1.91% (p < 0.001) and 98.37 ± 6.42% (p < 0.0001) respectively, while PE-HWA showed no activity. Nitric oxide (NO) released by BV2 microglia was notably (p < 0.0001) increased by 1 μg/mL lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from 7.46 ± 0.73 μM to 80.00 ± 3.78 μM indicating an inflammatory reaction. However, coincubation with 200 and 400 μg/mL of PE-ETH significantly (p < 0.0001) reduced the NO level to 58.57 ± 6.19 μM and 52.86 ± 3.43 μM respectively, while PE-HWA was noneffective. PE-ETH and PE-HWA at 40 μg/mL significantly increased the neurite-bearing cells from 4.70 ± 3.36% to 13.12 ± 2.82% (p < 0.01) and 20.93 ± 5.37% (p < 0.0001) respectively. Pleurotus eryngii, particularly the ethanol extract (PE-ETH) and its potentially bioactive compounds, could be explored as a neurohealth promoting agent, due to its collective neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and neurite outgrowth activities.",

P. eryngii polysaccharides (PEP) are one of the main components. Modulation of β-amyloid-induced neurotoxicity has emerged as a possible therapeutic approach to ameliorate the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of PEP on β-amyloid-induced neurotoxicity in cultured rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and aging rats. After 28 weeks' treatment, exposure of PC12 cells to P. eryngii polysaccharides significantly elevated cell viability, decreased the levels of intracellular calcium, and attenuated the β-amyloid-mediated cell apoptosis. In aging rats, P. eryngii polysaccharides could decrease the production of APP in the brain by an action that is associated with a lowering of the iNOS, and COX-2 level. Our findings indicated that P. eryngii polysaccharides had potential neuroprotective actions against β-amyloid-induced neurotoxicity, which might be through modulating calcium channels, or downstream molecules involved in inflammation.",

      "abstract": "We have recently demonstrated that we could enhance glucan content in Pleurotus eryngii following cultivation of the mushrooms on a substrate containing different concentrations of olive mill solid waste (OMSW). These changes are directly related to the content of OMSW in the growing substrate. Using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-in-flammatory bowel disease (IBD) mice model, we measured the colonic inflammatory response to the different glucan preparations. We found that the histology damaging score (HDS) resulting from DSS treatment reach a value of 11.8 ± 2.3 were efficiently downregulated by treatment with the fungal extracted glucans. Glucans extracted from stalks cultivated at 20% OMSW downregulated to a HDS value of 6.4 ± 0.5 whereas those cultivated at 80% OMSW showed the strongest effects (5.5 ± 0.6). Similar downregulatory effects were obtained for expression of various intestinal cytokines. All tested glucans were equally effective in regulating the number of CD14/CD16 monocytes from 18.2 ± 2.7% for DSS to 6.4 ± 2.0 for DSS + glucans extracted from stalks cultivated at 50% OMSW. We tested the effect of glucans on lipopolysaccharide-induced production of TNF-α, which demonstrated that stalk-derived glucans were more effective than caps-derived glucans. Isolated glucans competed with anti-Dectin-1 and anti-CR3 antibodies, indicating that they contain β-glucans recognized by these receptors. In conclusion, the most effective glucans in ameliorating IBD-associated symptoms induced by DSS treatment in mice were glucan extracts prepared from the stalk of P. eryngii grown at higher concentrations of OMSW. We conclude that these stress-induced growing conditions may be helpful in selecting more effective glucans derived from edible mushrooms.",

The results showed that the toughness, firmness and gumminess of the no-wounding treatment decreased to approximately 75-82.5% of the initial values, and the lignin content and expression of Pe4CL1 and Pe4CL3 decreased by 21-40% and 22-77%, respectively, in comparison to those of the other treatments in the first lignification. These findings indicated that wounding was the main factor inducing the first lignification. The second lignification of tested mushrooms was positively correlated with reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated senescence, accompanied by increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content, electrolyte leakage rate and mitochondrial dysfunction, which showed that ROS-mediated senescence played an essential role in the second lignification. This study is helpful for effective strategies to reduce lignification in stored mushrooms.",

      "abstract": "A preliminary biological investigation of the dry basidiomata of strain C-142-c of Pleurotus eryngii has shown significant antioxidant activity. Two different polysaccharides (PEPS-A1 and PEPS-A2) were isolated from the cultivated edible mushroom, P. eryngii C-142-c strain. Based on acid hydrolysis, methylation analysis, and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments (1H, 13C, distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer, double quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy, total correlation spectroscopy, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy, heteronuclear single-quantum correlation spectroscopy, and heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation spectroscopy), the structures of the repeating unit of PEPS-A1 and PEPS-A2 were established as follows: (l)PEPS-Al (α-glucan): [→6)-α-D-Glcp-(1→6)-α-D-Glcp-(l→]n; and (2) PEPS-A2 (β-glucan): [→6)-β-D-Glcp-(1→6)-β-D-Glcp-(l→]n. The antioxidant activity of PEPS-A1 and PEPS-A2 was evaluated as hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. PEPS-A1 and PEPS-A2 showed SC50 values of 400 μg/mL and 122 μg/mL, respectively, suggesting their possible use as a dietary supplement in functional foods. The polysaccharides were tested for their activity on cell viability using a colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (HT-29). Both polysaccharides affected cell viability after 48 and 72 hours of treatment, inducing the death of 50% of HT-29 cells between 0.25 and 1 μg/mL and between 0.5 and 1 μg/mL, respectively, for PEPS-A1 and PEPS-A2. These results are promising for future applications of these mushroom-derived polysaccharides as antioxidants and antitumor agents.",

It was then chemically converted to its sulfated form. Monosaccharide composition of β-glucan was characterized with p-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester-derivatized sugars through highperformance liquid chromatography analysis. Fourier transform infrared structural analysis showed an S=O bond at 1250 cm-1 and C-S-O binding at 815 cm-1 in PEBG-S. 13C nuclear magnetic resonance analysis showed 1,3-linked α-D-mannopyranosyl and 1,3-β-D-glucopyranosyl in PEBG-S. A concentration-dependent increase of nitric oxide production was noticed in RAW 264.7 cells treated with PEBG-S or PEBG; those treated with PEBG-S showed less cytotoxicity than those treated with PEBG. Cellular levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 were increased by PEBG and PEBG-S treatment, suggesting that they have immunomodulatory activity. Real-time polymerase chain reaction array revealed that the expression levels of nuclear factor-κB and Toll-like receptor signaling genes in cells were upregulated by PEBG and PEBG-S. Moreover, the expression of the β-glucan receptor dectin-2 was significantly upregulated by PEBG and PEBG-S treatment, reflecting immune activation through the dectin-2-Syk-(CARD9/Bcl-10/MALT1) pathway. Our results suggest that PEBG-S could be used as an effective adjuvant or immune enhancer that can be sustainably produced by recycling the by-product of mycelial culture.",

Moreover, the extracts showed Fe2+ chelating and reducing abilities, as well as a large amount of polyphenols and an inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation in the liver and brain tissues. The rats were fed a pellet diet (7.5 g/rat/day) containing P. eryngii var. ferulae DDL01 (PD) for 3 weeks. In the high-fat/high-cholesterol-induced hyperlipidemic rat model, administration of PD caused a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in the levels of serum triacylglycerols, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase and a significant increase (P < 0.05) in the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. PD administration significantly decreased high-fat/high-cholesterol-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. Treatment with the extracts (up to 500 μg/mL) did not significantly affect the viability of HepG2 and 3T3-L1 cells.

Alloxan-induced hyperglycemic mice were used to study the effects of P. eryngii on blood glucose, glycohemoglobin, insulin secretion, damaged pancreatic β-cells, total antioxidant status (TAOS), and hepatic glycogen in hyperglycemic mice. Sixty diabetic mice were divided equally into 5 groups: the alloxan (AX)-induced hyperglycemic group, the AX and glibenclamide (GLI)-treated group, the AX and P. eryngii extracts (PEEs) 50-treated group (PEE 50 mg/kg), the AX and PEE100-treated group (PEE 100 mg/kg), and the AX and PEE200-treated group (PEE 200 mg/kg). The other 12 normal mice were injected intravenously with the normal saline and used as the control group. After PEE (100 and 200 mg/kg) was orally administered to the mice over 5 weeks, blood glucose and HbAlc were significantly decreased in AX-induced hyperglycemic mice (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively), whereas the level of insulin secretion was markedly elevated in (P < 0.05). The pancreatic β-cells damaged by AX partially and gradually recovered after PPE extract was administered to the hyperglycemic mice for 35 days. In addition, PEE treatment gradually increased the body weight and significantly increased the concentration of hepatic glycogen in hyperglycemic mice (P < 0.05). The results suggest that the action of PPE on glycemic metabolism occurs via increasing glycogen and insulin concentrations as well as recovering injured β-cells and reducing free radical damage. PPE may become a new potential hypoglycemic food for hyperglycemic people.",

      "abstract": "Thiabendazole in the substrates incurred from spraying and premixing was translocated to the pileus, stipe, and volva of selected mushrooms. The spraying on the substrates resulted in higher residues of thiabendazole in all three mushrooms than the premixing treatment. For premixing, in the five substrates, half-lives of thiabendazole were found to be 13.6 days for shimeji, 10.0 days for king oyster, 13.7 days for oyster, 19.1 days for sterilized substrate, and 8.4 days for nonsterilized substrate, respectively. For spraying, the longest and shortest half-lives were found to be 19.5 and 8.1 days for the nonsterilized and sterilized substrates, respectively. The residues of thiabendazole in three edible fungi were increased with the incubation days from 3 to 5 to 7. The residues of thiabendazole in king oyster were the highest among the three fungi while those in shimeji and oyster showed similar patterns.",

      "abstract": "Eight distinct bacteria were isolated form diseased mycelia of the edible mushroom, Pleurotus eryngii. 16S rDNA sequence analysis showed that the isolates belonged to a variety of bacterial genera including Bacillus (LBS5), Enterobacter (LBS1), Sphingomonas (LBS8 and LBS10), Staphylococcus (LBS3, LBS4 and LBS9) and Moraxella (LBS6). Among them, 4 bacterial isolates including LBS1, LBS4, LBS5, and LBS9 evidenced growth inhibitory activity on the mushroom mycelia. The inhibitory activity on the growth of the mushroom fruiting bodies was evaluated by the treatment of the bacterial culture broth or the heat-treated cell-free supernatant of the broth. The treatment of the culture broths or the cell-free supernatants of LBS4 or LBS9 completely inhibited the formation of the fruiting body, thereby suggesting that the inhibitory agent is a heat-stable compound. In the case of LBS5, only the bacterial cell-containing culture broth was capable of inhibiting the formation of the fruiting body, whereas the cell-free supernatant did not, which suggests that an inhibitory agent generated by LBS5 is a protein or a heat-labile chemical compound, potentially a fungal cell wall-degrading enzyme. The culture broth of LBS1 was not inhibitory. However, its cell-free supernatant was capable of inhibiting the formation of fruiting bodies. This indicates that LBS1 may produce an inhibitory heat-stable chemical compound which is readily degraded by its own secreted enzyme."
