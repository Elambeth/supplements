      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Long covid describes a syndrome of persistent symptoms following COVID-19 and is responsible for substantial healthcare and economic burden. Currently, no effective treatments have been established. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal) is a medicinal herb traditionally used in India for its immune-strengthening and anti-inflammatory properties. Withanolides, a family of steroid-derived molecules unique to Ashwagandha, have been shown to modulate inflammatory pathways in animal models, and several small randomised trials in humans support its effectiveness for reducing symptoms that are also associated with long covid. Therefore, this study aims to assess whether Ashwagandha is effective and safe for improving functional status and reducing symptom burden in adults living with long covid. METHODS: A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial will be performed at participating general practice (GP) surgeries and long covid clinics across the UK. Individuals diagnosed with long covid will be screened for eligibility and then randomised 1:1 to take 1000 mg daily of Ashwagandha root extract tablets (standardised to <0.9% withanolides) or matching placebo tablets for 3 months (target, n = 2500). Monthly online surveys will be performed to collect patient-reported outcomes, and monthly safety monitoring, including liver function tests, will be conducted by clinical site teams. The primary outcome of the Post-COVID Functional Status Scale score at 3 months will be assessed by baseline-adjusted ordinal logistic regression, according to a pre-published statistical analysis plan. The secondary outcomes included validated quality of life and long covid symptom scales, work status and productivity and adverse events. The trial has been approved as a Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Produce by the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority and by the NHS Research Ethics Committee and Health Research Authority. DISCUSSION: Treatments for long covid are urgently needed. This trial will robustly evaluate the safety and efficacy of a candidate treatment with a promising efficacy and safety profile. If found to be effective, the findings will likely influence treatment guidelines and improve health outcomes in those living with long covid. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: This trial was pre-registered on 15/08/2022: ISRCTN12368131.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent approaches in breast cancer treatment involve exploring natural extracts either as substitutes for traditional chemotherapeutic agents or as adjuvants to enhance their effectiveness. In this context, ethanolic extracts from Withania Somnifera (WS) and Arctium Lappa (AL) have gained attention for their potential anticancer properties across various cancer types. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the in vitro anticancer efficacy of ethanolic extracts from both WS and AL in the MCF7 breast cancer cell line. METHODS: The study encompassed assessments of total antioxidant activity, total flavonoids, total phenolic compounds, and cytotoxicity for each extract. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of these extracts involved Real-time PCR and flow cytometry to analyze apoptotic markers and cell cycle dynamics, respectively. RESULTS: Results indicated that the WS ethanolic extract exhibited better efficacy, especially in terms of IC50. To explore its potential as an adjuvant with doxorubicin (DOX) in breast cancer therapy, 16 non-constant combination ratios were tested. The combination of 1/2 WS to 1/4 DOX, with a combination index (CI) of -0.229 was selected for further downstream molecular analysis. Gene expression analysis revealed a significant upregulation (p < 0.05) of P53, Cas3, Cas7, and Bax. Flow cytometric analysis further highlighted cell cycle arrest at the S phase. Additionally, the study explored the synergistic inhibitory effects of WS and DOX on key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, namely, pyruvate kinase and aldolase. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the ethanolic extract of WS demonstrated a synergistic effect as an adjuvant with DOX, showing promise as a combination therapy for breast cancer.",

This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of ashwagandha extract standardized with Sominone (Somin-On™) in enhancing memory and cognitive functioning in adults with MCI. METHODS: In this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study, 40 subjects with MCI were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Somin-On™ (250 mg daily) or a placebo for 60 days. The outcome measures, improvement in memory and other cognitive functions after 30 and 60 days were assessed using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); Mini-mental state examination (MMSE); Wechsler Memory Scale-III (WMS-III)); and Shepard mental rotation task. RESULTS: Subjects treated with Somin-On™ showed significant improvements in immediate memory, general memory, working memory and visuospatial processing and the response assessed using WMS-III after 30 and 60 days outperforming the placebo group. Scores on the Shepard Mental Rotation test in Somin-On™ group showed a significant rise by 12.22% at 30 days and 31.67% at 60 days, from baseline. Significant improvement was observed with Somin-On™ in memory assessment scales viz. MoCA (7.83% at 30 days and 14.77% at 60 days, from baseline) and MMSE (9.26% at 30 days and 19.21% at 60 days, from baseline) compared to placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: The supplementation of Somin-On™ is an effective therapy to improve the immediate, general and working memory, as well as cognitive functions like attention and information processing speed in adults with MCI.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate greywater treatment through hydroponically growing ashwagandha, often referred to as \"Indian Ginseng,\" which is rich in secondary metabolites and bioactive compounds that enhance its medicinal properties. The research examines the effect of input parameters, such as initial chemical oxygen demand (300-1500 mg/L), phosphate (0-120 mg/L), and nitrate (15-75 mg/L) and their optimization utilizing response surface methodology (RSM) with central composite design (CCD). The interactive effects are analysed with model fit through analysis of variance. The optimized parameters are investigated as 600 mg/L chemical oxygen demand (COD), 37 mg/L phosphate, and 35 mg/L nitrate, with maximum removal efficiencies of 97.74% COD, 93.62% total phosphorus, and 89.68% nitrate-nitrogen while preserving ashwagandha's medicinal qualities. The study assesses growth improvements through physiological traits, showing increase of 72.2% in wet biomass, 20% in plant height, 60% in leaf number, and total chlorophyll content of 45.45 μmol m-2. It also examines phytochemical characteristics, including fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis (-OH peaks within 3500-3000 cm-1) and total phenolic content of leaf and root extracts, measuring 7.14 mg gallic acid equivalents for leaves and 2.155 mg GAE for roots. Additionally, the extracts demonstrated radical scavenging activities of 73.26% for leaves and 83.74% for roots after treatment, highlighting ashwagandha's adaptability and resilience in greywater conditions. Lastly, scanning electron microscopy analysis to assess the impact of wastewater on the root structure. This research presents significant economic potential of the greywater treatment within 6 days by cultivating ashwagandha with the preservation of its medicinal properties.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study explored the role of Withania somnifera/Ashwagandha root extract (ARE) on important gut-microbiome parameters in healthy geriatric dogs. We hypothesized that ARE might promote a healthy gut by its adaptogenic and anti-inflammatory effects and improve vital parameters for healthy ageing. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Telangana, India. Twelve healthy geriatric Beagle dogs aged 12-15 years were enrolled. The dogs were divided into two groups to receive ARE (15 mg/kg, once daily, orally, for 2 months) or a placebo control. Various parameters were assessed, including serum haematology, biochemical markers, stool parameters, and gut-microbiome parameters. RESULTS: The erythrocyte counts and haemoglobin levels were significantly increased with ARE (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001). Moreover, a significant decrease in important serum liver biomarkers (alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST]; p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 at day 60) was observed in the ARE-treated dogs compared to that in the placebo control group. In addition, the levels of L-citrulline were significantly modulated by ARE intervention, whereas the intervention did not affect intestinal-type alkaline phosphatase (I-ALP), lactate, and carbamoyl-phosphate synthase (CPS). Interestingly, the faecal score reduced significantly with ARE (p < 0.001), while the faecal pH remained unaltered. Compared to the baseline, ARE significantly decreased two microbial metabolites, propionic acid, and total short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels after 60 days of intervention, whereas butyrate and acetic acid levels remained unchanged in the faecal samples. CONCLUSION: In summary, these findings suggest that ARE has gut health promoting benefits in healthy geriatric dogs by improving haematological and biochemical profiles; the levels of L-citrulline; propionic acid; and SCFA; thus, reducing age-related changes by modulating the microbiome and the associated metabolites."

      "abstract": "As global change threatens avian biodiversity, understanding species responses to environmental perturbations due to radiation emitted by enormous increase in the application of wireless communication is very urgent. The study investigates the effect of MW radiation on redox balance, stress level, male fertility and the efficacy of Withania somnifera (WS) root extract (100 mg/kg body weight) orally administered in 8 weeks old mature male Japanese quail exposed to 2.4 GHz MW radiation for 2 h/day for 30 days with power density = 0.1264 mw/cm2 and SAR = 0.9978 W/Kg. Wi-fi exposure induces a decrease in testicular weight, volume, density and gonado-somatic index (GSI) while Ashwagandha increases them. Oxidative stress parameters increased and activity of SOD, catalase, GSH was reduced in testes of exposed quail while Ashwagandha treatment reinstates the redox balance. Exposure to Wi-fi alters quail reproduction by increase in corticosterone and decreased testosterone with reduced expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in testis. Wi-fi exposure increases IL1β and reduces IL10 in testis. IL-1β inhibits testicular cell function and promotes apoptosis by increasing NF-κB and decreasing sperm count in exposed quails. Ashwagandha increases expression of ERα, sperm count and immunity in quail testis. Further, decrease in IL1β, NF-κB and increase in IL-10 after administration of Ashwagandha in Wi-fi exposed quail prevents inflammatory damages and enhances gonadal function. Thus, exposure to Wi-fi increases oxidative stress, activates apoptosis, modulates immunity in testis while Ashwagandha reverses them via enhanced ERα expression, increase in sperm count thereby enhancing fertility in male Japanese quail.",

It is known to exert stress-mitigating properties and has been extensively studied for its safety and efficacy in various disorders. This in vivo study assessed the effects of Ashwagandha root extract (ARE) on stress in rats. The anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of ARE were assessed using the elevated plus maze test, sucrose preference test, and forced swim test. The rats were divided into the following groups: control group (no disease), disease control group (no treatment), standardized ARE group (test; ARE administered in doses of 27, 54, and 108 mg/kg body weight), and fluoxetine group (active control). Biochemical parameters in the serum [monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A, MAO-B, serotonin, cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)] and brain tissue (serotonin) were estimated at the end of 36 days to understand the potential mechanism behind the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of ARE. The behavior test results indicated significant improvement in anxiety and depression-like behavior with ARE treatment in a rat model exposed to a validated protocol of chronic variable stress. The results of biochemical analyses revealed a significant increase in serotonin and BDNF levels and a decrease in CRH, ACTH, and cortisol levels. The inflammatory markers IL-6 and TNF-α were also significantly reduced with ARE treatment. ARE demonstrated notable effects on anxiety and depression markers in rats, indicating its potential as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent."

AIM OF THE STUDY: We evaluated the neuroprotective and antidepressant effects of ashwagandha root extract (ARE) on corticosterone-exposed HT-22 cells and unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS)-challenged mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The neuroprotective properties of ARE containing withanolide A were assessed in HT-22 cells subjected to corticosterone-induced oxidative stress. Additionally, the effects of ARE on depression-like behavior, stress-related hormones, and inflammatory cytokine levels were evaluated in a mouse model of UCMS. RESULTS: In HT-22 cells, ARE (100 and 200 μg/mL) and its constituent, withanolide A (1.56 and 3.12 μg/mL), mitigated corticosterone-induced increases in MAO activity, ROS, and MDA levels. Treatment also reversed corticosterone-induced reductions in BDNF, TrkB, p-AKT, p-ERK, and p-CREB and normalized Nrf2 and Keap1 levels, thereby elevating HO-1 expression. In UCMS mice, ARE improved behavioral outcomes, increased sucrose preference, and reduced immobility in the forced swimming test while enhancing activity in the open field test and elevated plus maze. ARE decreased the levels of stress hormones (corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and corticosterone) and increased the levels of neurotransmitters (L-DOPA, 5-HTP, and serotonin). Histological analysis revealed that ARE reduced hippocampal cell loss. Additionally, ARE (60 and 100 mg/kg) restored decreased levels of p-AKT, p-ERK, and p-CREB and lowered inflammation-related proteins (Cox2, iNOS, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that ARE containing withanolide A exhibits notable neuroprotective and antidepressant properties.",

      "abstract": "We investigated the effect of purified withanolides and extracts derived from Ashwagandha on steatosis, the abnormal accumulation of fat that can lead to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Collaborator of ARF (CARF, also known as CDKN2AIP, a protein that regulates hepatic lipid metabolism, fat buildup, and liver damage) was used as an indicator. Six withanolides (Withaferin A, Withanone, Withanolide B, Withanoside IV, Withanoside V, and Withanostraminolide-12 deoxy) reversed the decrease in CARF caused by exposure to free fatty acids (FFAs) in liver-derived cells (HepG2 hepatocytes). After analyzing the effects of these withanolides on CARF mRNA and protein levels, FFA accumulation, protein aggregation, and oxidative and DNA damage stresses, we selected Withaferin A and Withanone for molecular analyses. Using the palmitic-acid-induced fatty acid accumulation stress model in Huh7 cells, we found a significant reduction in the activity of the key regulators of lipogenesis pathways, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARγ and PPARα). This in vitro study suggests that low, non-toxic doses of Withaferin A, Withanone, or Ashwagandha extracts containing these withanolides possess anti-steatosis and antioxidative-stress properties. Further in vivo and clinical studies are required to investigate the therapeutic potential of these Ashwagandha-derived bioactive ingredients for NAFLD.",

      "abstract": "Withania somnifera (WS), also known as ashwagandha, is a popular botanical supplement used to treat various conditions including memory loss, anxiety and depression. Previous studies from our group showed an aqueous extract of WS root (WSAq) enhances cognition and alleviates markers for depression in Drosophila. Here, we sought to confirm these effects in the 5xFAD mouse model of β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation. Six- to seven-month-old male and female 5xFAD mice were treated with WSAq in their drinking water at 0 mg/mL, 0.5 mg/mL or 2.5 mg/mL for four weeks. In the fourth week of treatment, spatial memory, anxiety and depressive-like symptoms were evaluated. At the conclusion of behavioral testing, brain tissue was harvested, immunohistochemistry was performed, and the cortical expression of antioxidant response genes was evaluated. Both concentrations of WSAq improved spatial memory and reduced depressive and anxiety-related behavior. These improvements were accompanied by a reduction in Aβ plaque burden in the hippocampus and cortex and an attenuation of activation of microglia and astrocytes. Antioxidant response genes were upregulated in the cortex of WSAq-treated mice. Oral WSAq treatment could be beneficial as a therapeutic option in AD for improving disease pathology and behavioral symptoms. Future studies focused on dose optimization of WSAq administration and further assessment of the mechanisms by which WSAq elicits its beneficial effects will help inform the clinical potential of this promising botanical therapy."

The present study evaluates the therapeutic potential of 57 phytoconstituents of Withania somnifera against CST. Using binding score cutoff ≤-7.0 kcal/mol, top 10 compounds were screened and after ADME and toxicity-based screening, Withasomidienone, 2,4-methylene-cholesterol, and 2,3-Didehydrosomnifericin were identified as safe and potent drug candidates for CST inhibition. Key substrate binding site residues involved in interaction were LYS82, LYS85, SER89, TYR176, PHE170, PHE177. Four steroidal Lactone-based withanolide backbone of these compounds played a critical role in stabilizing their position in the active site pocket. 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation and subsequent trajectory analysis through structural deviation and compactness, principal components, free energy landscape and correlation matrix confirmed the stability of CST-2,3-Didehydrosomnifericin complex throughout the simulation and therefore is considered as the most potent drug candidate for CST inhibition and Withasomidienone as the second most potent drug candidate. The reverse pharmacophore analysis further confirmed the specificity of these two compounds towards CST as no major cross targets were identified. Thus, identified compounds in this study strongly present their candidature for oral drug and provide route for further development of more specific CST inhibitors."

      "abstract": "Ashwagandha or Withania somnifera is an herbal plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. Because of its wide range of phytochemicals, ashwagandha root extract has been used in numerous research studies, either alone or in conjunction with other natural plants, for various biomedical applications, which include its anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, anti-stress, anti-tumor, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective properties. Additionally, it improves endothelial function, lowers reactive oxygen species, controls apoptosis, and improves mitochondrial function. These properties make it a useful treatment for a variety of conditions, including age-related symptoms, anxiety, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, stress, arthritis, fatigue, and cognitive/memory impairment. Despite the numerous benefits of ashwagandha supplementation, there have been just four meta-analyses on the herb's effectiveness in treating anxiety, neurobehavioral disorders, impotence, and infertility. Moreover, no reviews exist that examine how ashwagandha affects antioxidant response and physical sports performance. Consequently, the goal of this study was to analyze the scientific literature regarding the effects of ashwagandha consumption on antioxidant response and athletic performance."

      "abstract": "Withania somnifera, commonly known as Ashwagandha, has been popular for many years. Numerous studies have shown that the extract of this plant, due to its wealth of active substances, can induce anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, immunomodulatory, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, anti-diabetic, adaptogenic, anti-arthritic, anti-stress, and antimicrobial effects. This review examines the impact of Ashwagandha extract on the vascular endothelium, inflammation, lipid metabolism, and cardiovascular outcomes. Studies have shown that Ashwagandha extracts exhibit an anti-angiogenic effect by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced capillary sprouting and formation by lowering the mean density of microvessels. Furthermore, the results of numerous studies highlight the anti-inflammatory role of Ashwagandha extract, as the action of this plant causes a decrease in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, withanolides, present in Ashwagandha root, have shown the ability to inhibit the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes. Research results have also proved that W. somnifera demonstrates cardioprotective effects due to its antioxidant properties and reduces ischemia/reperfusion-induced apoptosis. It seems that this plant can be successfully used as a potential treatment for several conditions, mainly those with increased inflammation. More research is needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which the substances contained in W. somnifera extracts can act in the human body.",

We hypothesized that ARE can reduce the effects of advancing age, including physiological changes, immune response decline and susceptibility to diseases, by its immunomodulatory effects. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Telangana, India, from July 2022 to September 2022. Twenty apparently healthy dogs, aged 8 years or older, were enrolled. The dogs were divided into two groups to receive ARE (15 mg/kg, once daily, orally) or a placebo control. Various parameters, including serum cortisol levels, haematological profiles, biochemical markers, antioxidant indicators and anti-inflammatory responses, were assessed at the initiation of study, day 30, and day 60. RESULTS: The erythrocyte count and haemoglobin levels were significantly increased with ARE (p < 0.001), whereas leukocyte count decreased (p < 0.05). Moreover, significant decreases in important markers of liver function (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, albumin and globulin; p < 0.001 at day 60), as well as kidney function markers (creatinine and blood urea nitrogen; p < 0.001 at days 30 and 60), were observed in ARE-treated dogs compared to the placebo control group. In addition, the levels of markers of oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione and malondialdehyde) were significantly modulated by ARE intervention, indicating strong antioxidant effects. Interestingly, serum cortisol levels reduced significantly with ARE (p < 0.001). Compared to baseline, ARE significantly decreased key inflammatory markers, including interferon-γ, tumour necrosis factor-α, nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells and interleukin-10 (p < 0.001) levels at day 60. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that ARE has adaptogenic properties in healthy geriatric dogs by improving haematological and biochemical profiles, enhancing antioxidant defence, reducing stress and modulating inflammatory responses.",

Ashwagandha and Andrographis are purported to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity, but this is based on exposure of cells to the parent compounds ignoring phytochemical absorption and metabolism. We explored the anti-inflammatory/antioxidant effects of ashwagandha and Andrographis in ex vivo human models of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Healthy participants supplemented with 2000 mg/day Andrographis (n = 10) or 1100 mg/day ashwagandha (n = 10) for 28 days. Sera collected pre (D0) and post (D28) supplementation were pooled by timepoint and added to adipose explant (AT) and primary human myotube (SKMC) culture media (15% v/v) for treatment. A Taqman panel of 56 genes was used to quantify these. In AT, treatment with ashwagandha sera decreased the expression of genes involved in antioxidant defence and inflammatory response (CCL5, CD36, IL6, IL10, ADIPOQ, NFEL2, UCP2, GPX3, GPX4; geometric 95% CI for fold change > 1) and altered the expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism. In SKMC, ashwagandha sera altered FOXO1 and SREBF1 expression. Andrographis sera decreased IL18 and SERPINEA3 expression in AT. This physiologically relevant in vitro screening characterises the effects of ashwagandha in AT to guide future clinical trials.",

Rats treated with AM (90 mg/kg), protected by ASE doses (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg), and treated by ASE at the same three doses. At the end of the experimental period, DNA comet assay, cytogenetic examinations, sperm-shape analysis, evaluation of the malondialdehyde (MDA) percentages, histopathological examinations, and biophysical tests (modulus, relaxation time, permittivity, entropy, and internal energy change of brain) were documented. The results confirmed that AM treatment induced significant elevation of DNA damage, cytogenetic aberrations, and MDA content in brain, liver, and testis tissues and sperm-shape anomalies. ASE treatment significantly minimized the genetic changes, sperm-shape anomalies, and MDA generation. These enhancements were more pronounced by protective ASE and increased by increasing the dose level. In histopathological examinations, AM treatment caused neurotoxicity in brain tissue. ASE treatment, partially, minimized these damages and the positive effects of therapeutic ASE were more noticeable. Biophysical parameters showed that therapeutic ASE was better for relaxation time, permittivity, and free energy change. Protective and therapeutic ASE were able to recover entropy and internal energy changes in variant degrees."

Ashwagandha (ASW), a medicinal plant is known to prevent neurodegeneration and promote neuronal health. This study investigated the effects of MWR and ASW on oxidative stress and cholinergic imbalance in the hippocampus of adult male Japanese quail. One control group received no treatment, the second group quails were exposed to MWR at 2 h/day for 30 days, third was administered with ASW root extract orally 100 mg/day/kg body weight and the fourth was exposed to MWR and also treated with ASW. The results showed that MWR increased serum corticosterone levels, disrupted cholinergic balance and induced neuro-inflammation. This neuro-inflammation further led to oxidative stress, as evidenced by decreased activity of antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT and GSH. MWR also caused a significant decline in the nissil substances in the hippocampus region of brain indicating neurodegeneration through oxidative stress mediated hippocampal apoptosis. ASW, on the other hand, was able to effectively enhance the cholinergic balance and subsequently lower inflammation in hippocampus neurons. This suggests that ASW can protect against the neurodegenerative effects of MWR. ASW also reduced excessive ROS production by increasing the activity of ROS-scavenging enzymes. Additionally, ASW prevented neurodegeneration through decreased expression of caspase-3 and caspase-7 in hippocampus, thus promoting neuronal health. In conclusion, this study showed that MWR induces apoptosis and oxidative stress in the brain, while ASW reduces excessive ROS production, prevents neurodegeneration and promotes neuronal health.",

Preclinical trials demonstrate that WS slows disease progression in multiple different animal models of ALS. Of the five individuals we found who described using WS for their ALS, two individuals reported moderate benefit while none reported experiencing any significant side effects. There is currently one clinical trial using WS to treat PALS; the results are not yet published. There are no serious side effects associated with WS and the associated cost of this treatment is low.

Despite numerous research data supporting the benefits of this wonder herb, the actual use of ashwagandha for cancer treatment in clinics is limited. The primary reason for this is the inconsistent therapeutic outcome due to highly variable composition and constitution of active ingredients in the plant extract impacting ashwagandha's pharmacology. We investigate here an engineered yield: an ashwagandha extract (Oncowithanib) that has a unique and fixed portion of active ingredients to achieve consistent and effective therapeutic activity. Using the MCF7 cell line, Oncowithanib was studied for its anti-neoplastic efficacy and drug targets associated with cell cycle regulation, translation machinery, and cell survival and apoptosis. Results demonstrate a dose-dependent decline in Oncowithanib-treated MCF7 cell viability and reduced colony-forming ability. Treated cells showed increased cell death as evidenced by enhancement of Caspase 3 enzyme activity and decreased expressions of cell proliferation markers such as Ki67 and Aurora Kinase A. Oncowithanib treatment was also found to be associated with expressional suppression of key cellular kinases such as RSK1, Akt1, and mTOR in MCF7 cells. Our findings indicate that Oncowithanib decreases MCF7 cell survival and propagation, and sheds light on common drug targets that might be good candidates for the development of cancer therapeutics. Further in-depth investigations are required to fully explore the potency and pharmacology of this novel extract. This study also highlights the importance of the standardization of herbal extracts to get consistent therapeutic activity for the disease indication.",

Beyond evaluating muscular aspects, the study explored chronic low-grade inflammation, muscle regeneration, and mitochondrial biogenesis. WSE administration, in comparison to the control group, demonstrated no significant differences in body weight, diet, or water intake, affirming its safety profile. Notably, WSE exhibited a propensity to reduce epidermal and abdominal fat while significantly increasing muscle mass at a dosage of 200 mg/kg. The muscle-to-fat ratio, adjusted for body weight, increased across all treatment groups. WSE administration led to a reduction in the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β, mitigating inflammation-associated muscle atrophy. In a 12-month-old mouse model equivalent to a 50-year-old human, WSE effectively preserved muscle strength, stabilized grip strength, and increased muscle tissue weight. Positive effects were observed in running performance and endurance. Mechanistically, WSE balanced muscle protein synthesis/degradation, promoted fiber differentiation, and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis through the IGF-1/Akt/mTOR pathway. This study provides compelling evidence for the anti-sarcopenic effects of WSE, positioning it as a promising candidate for preventing sarcopenia pending further clinical validation.",

Dunal, known as Ashwagandha, is an adaptogen with significant importance in Ayurveda for its potential health benefits in strength ('balavardhan') and muscle growth ('mamsavardhan'). Despite numerous studies on its efficacy, limited research is reported on its clinical safety and tolerability in healthy individuals. OBJECTIVE: This research evaluated the tolerability and safety of standardized Withania somnifera root extract (WSE) capsules (AgeVel®/Witholytin®) at 1000 mg/day dose upon oral administration in healthy male participants. METHOD: A non-randomized, open-label, single-treatment clinical study included eighteen healthy male participants aged 18 to 60. The participants were administered a dose of 500 mg of the WSE capsules twice daily for four weeks. Each capsule contained not less than 7.50 mg of total withanolides. The study evaluated various indicators in a cohort of healthy participants throughout the trial, including vital signs, organ function tests, urine analysis, X-ray and ECG, cardiorespiratory endurance, body fat percentage, lean body weight, adverse events profile, and tolerability of the WSE capsules. RESULTS: The participant's physical, hematological, and biochemical characteristics were normal, and no significant alterations or irregularities were observed in safety metrics like liver, kidney, and thyroid functions after administering AgeVel®/Witholytin®. CONCLUSION: This study found that healthy male participants could consume a standardized WSE at a daily dosage of 1000 mg for four weeks without any adverse effects. Future research should focus on long-term safety assessments in male and female participants."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The present study explored the molecular mechanism of herbal (Unani) drug Habb-e-asgandh as anti-tumorigenic adjuvant therapy experimentally in U266 cells and its role in treatment of Multiple myeloma. The formulation of Habb-e-asgandh is investigated alone or as a combinatorial therapy with standard drug lenalidomide to check for its efficacy against U266 myeloma cells for prevention of drug relapse and resistance. METHODS: We performed the following assays on singly or in combination of Habb-e-asgandh-Lenalidomide treated U266 cells. The cytotoxicity evaluation done by MTT assay, we studied cell cycle kinetics by Propidium Iodide staining, mitochondrial apoptosis analysis by Annexin V/PI dual staining and JC1 staining assays. Further, anti-oxidative potential was assessed by ORAC assay and cytokine levels estimation of anti-inflammatory (TNF-alpha and IL6) and anti-angiogenic (VEGF and Ang-2) markers were done by ELISA. RESULTS: The myeloma U266 cells when treated with Habb-e-asgandh alone or in combination with standard drug lenalidomide showed cytotoxicity in dose dependent manner with promising effects at 0.4 mg/ml (IC30) and 1.5 mg/ml (IC50) inhibitory concentrations. The formulation treated cells showed modulation in cell cycle kinetics patterned by sub Go/G1 population accumulation. Furthermore, it induced mitochondrial apoptosis mainly at half maximal inhibitory concentration and in combinatorial combinations. Significantly elevated oxidative capacities (p<0.05) and reduced levels of angiogenic and pro-inflammatory markers were observed. Multiple mechanism based inhibition by Habb-e-asgandh in co-treatment with lenalidomide against myeloma cells is indicated.  Conclusion: Habb-e-asgandh formulation possess anti-tumorigenic efficacy against multiple myeloma. The adjunctive Habb-e-asgandh formulation with standard chemotherapeutic drug may prove to be a potent anti-myeloma agent in interventional therapy for Multiple myeloma if further studied in future avenues.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ashwagandha extracts play a significant role in traditional Indian medicine to help treat a wide range of disorders from amnesia, erectile dysfunction, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, cancer, stress, anxiety, and many more. Ashwagandha root is enriched with bioactive plant metabolites of which withanolides are the most important ones. The concentration and constitution of withanolides primarily determine ashwagandha's potency and pharmacology. Various factors modulate the withanolide constitution in the plant-derived extracts, rendering inconsistent therapeutic efficacy. Standardisation of the extraction protocol and a better understanding of the pharmacology mechanism of different extracts with varied withanolide constitutions is therefore critical for developing reliable, repeatable, and effective ashwagandha-based treatment. OBJECTIVES: Here, we work toward defining indication mechanisms for two varieties of ashwagandha extract-ASHWITH (ASH-Ext1) and Regenolide (ASH-Ext2)-with different proprietary withanolide proportions. METHODS: ASH-Ext1 was studied for antioxidant signaling modulation using HEK293, HeLa, and A549 cells, and ASH-Ext2 was studied for subcellular drug targets associated with the reactivation and longevity of human hair follicles, using primary human hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs). RESULTS: Study findings support the antioxidant activity and Nrf2 signaling modulation by ASH-Ext1 in various cell models. Of note, ASH-Ext2 was found to increase β-catenin and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) protein expression levels in HFDPCs. CONCLUSION: The results of drug target modulation show us that the withanolide constitution associated with different extraction protocols influences the pharmacological potential of the extract significantly and points to the value of standardisation not only of total withanolide content but also of internal withanolide proportions."

Ashwagandha (ASH) roots are traditionally used for memory enhancement. This study aimed to evaluate the nootropic activity of ASH as well as its therapeutic anti-amnesic activity against MSG-induced hippocampal-dependent spatial memory impairment and hippocampal-NMDAR modulation. METHOD: A total of 36 rats were divided equally into six groups (n = 6 in each group); the rats in the normal and negative groups were administered daily doses of normal saline and MSG (300 mg/kg), respectively, for 21 days. Two nootropic groups were administered ASH at 300 and 500 mg/kg o.p., respectively, for 21 days. Two other treatment groups were administered daily doses of MSG 300 mg/kg o.p. as well as 300 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg o.p. of ASH for 21 days. The rats' spatial memory was assessed for five days using the MWM. Additionally, NMDAR were measured quantitatively by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: We found that the rats in the nootropic groups showed significantly enhanced nootropic activity characterized by improved hippocampal-dependent spatial memory, as well as increases in the level of NMDAR in the Cornu Ammonis 1 region of their hippocampus. Moreover, we elucidated the therapeutic potential of ASH to protect against the depression of spatial memory caused by MSG-induced neurotoxicity. CONCLUSION: Further, we elucidated a strong correlation between NMDAR-positive cells in the hippocampus and enhancement of spatial learning induced by long-term administration of ASH as well as a strong correlation between NMDAR positive cells in the hippocampus and depression of spatial learning induced by long-term administration of ASH and MSG.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ashwagandha-Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal, well known for its multipotent therapeutic properties has been used in Ayurveda for 3000 years. The plant with more than 50 active phytoconstituents is recognised for its anti-cancerous, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and neurotherapeutic properties demonstrated in in vitro studies and chemically induced rodent models. Genetically targeted Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative disease models have been created in Drosophila and have been used to get mechanistic insight into the in vivo cellular events, and genetic pathways that underlie respective neurodegenerative condition. But hitherto, there aren't enough attempts made to capitalize the genetic potential of these disease models to validate the therapeutic efficacy of different reagents used in traditional medicine, in the context of specific disease-causing genetic mutations. AIM OF THE STUDY: Drugs discovered using in vitro platforms might fail in several instances of clinical trials because of the genetic heterogeneity and variability in the physiological context found among the patients. Drosophila by virtue of its genetically regulated experimental potential forms an ideal in vivo model to validate the candidate reagents discovered in in vitro screens for their efficacy under specific genetic situations. Here we have used genetically induced α-synucleinopathy and tauopathy transgenic fly models to study the efficacy of Ashwagandha treatment, assessing cellular and behavioural parameters. METHODS: We have expressed the disease-causing human gene mutations in specific cell types of Drosophila using GAL4/UAS targeted expression system to create disease models. Human α-synuclein mutant (A30P) was expressed in dopaminergic neurons using Ddc-GAL4 driver strain to induce dopaminergic neurodegeneration and assayed for motor dysfunction. Human TauE14, mutant protein was expressed in photoreceptor neurons using GMR-GAL4 driver to induce photoreceptor degeneration. Microtubular destability and mitotic arrest in the dividing photoreceptor precursor cells were studied using αPH3 antibody. Lysosomal dysregulation caused necrotic black spots were induced by TauE14 with GMR-GAL4 driver, in a white mutant background. These flies mimicking neurodegenerative conditions were supplemented with different concentrations of Ashwagandha aqueous root extract mixed with regular fly food. The treated flies were analysed for cellular and behaviour parameters. RESULTS: Lifespan assay shows that, Ashwagandha-root extract imparts an extended lifespan in male Drosophila flies which are intrinsically less stress resistant. Motor dysfunction caused due to human α-synuclein mutant protein expressed in dopaminergic neurons is greatly brought down. Further, Ashwagandha extract treatment significantly reduces TauE14 induced microtubular destability, mitotic arrest and neuronal death in photoreceptor neurons. Our experiment with tauopathy model in white mutant background exemplify that, Ashwagandha-root extract treatment can bring down lysosomal dysregulation induced necrosis of photoreceptor neurons. CONCLUSION: We have carried out a multifaceted study which elucidates that Ashwagandha can serve as a comprehensive, phytotherapeutic formulation to combat neurodegeneration, targeting multiple causative genetically defective conditions.",

Dunal (Ws) is a common herb plant that has been used for centuries to treat a wide range of conditions, particularly certain chronic diseases due to its antidiabetic, cardioprotective, antistress, and chondroprotective effects, among many others. No conclusive evidence, however, exists about the potential health effects of Ws in adults without chronic conditions. We aimed to evaluate the current evidence on the health benefits of Ws supplementation in healthy adults. RECENT FINDINGS: Based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we systematically reviewed studies indexed in Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed to assess the effects of Ws on hematological and biochemical markers, hormonal behavior, and oxidant response in healthy adults. Original articles published up to March 5, 2022, with a controlled trial design or pre-post intervention design, in which supplementation of Ws was compared to a control group or data prior to intervention were included. Among 2,421 records identified in the search, 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall, most of the studies reported beneficial effects of the Ws supplementation, and no serious adverse events were reported. Participants supplemented with Ws displayed reduced levels of oxidative stress and inflammation, and counterbalanced hormone levels. No evidence of the beneficial effects of Ws supplementation on hematological markers was reported. Ws supplementation appears to be safe, may regulate hormone levels, and has potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the relevance of its application.",

Dunal), an Indian medicinal plant that has been used for centuries to treat insomnia, exhibits a variety of biological activities, such as improving cognitive function, immunity and anxiety. In this study, the effect of enzyme-treated Ashwagandha root extract (EA) and on sleep was evaluated using rodent models. Starch contained in the Ashwagandha root extract was removed by amylase treatment to prepare EA. To evaluate the sleep-promoting activity of EA, a pentobarbital-induced sleep test and electroencephalogram analysis were performed. In addition, the sleep-promoting mechanism of EA was elucidated by analyzing the expression of sleep-related receptors. In the pentobarbital-induced sleep test, EA dose-dependently increased sleep duration. Additionally, electroencephalogram analysis revealed that EA significantly increased δ-wave and non-rapid eye movement sleep times, which are involved in deep sleep, thereby improving sleep quality and quantity. EA also effectively relieved caffeine-induced insomnia symptoms. Furthermore, the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content in the brain and mRNA and protein expression of GABAA, GABAB1, and serotonin receptors were significantly increased by EA compared to the normal group. In particular, EA showed sleep-promoting activity by binding to various GABAA receptor sites. Collectively, EA exhibited sleep-promoting activity through the GABAergic system and may be used as a functional material to improve sleep deprivation.",

      "abstract": "Background Facial skin has an essential cosmetic function in both men and women, and photoaged skin can affect the quality of life in healthy people. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) which is also called Indian ginseng has adaptogenic properties and is used in traditional Indian medicine to maintain balance, energize, and rejuvenate. Objective This randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study assessed the efficacy and safety of topical application of lotion containing 8% standardized Ashwagandha root extract on improvement of skin parameters in the photoaged facial skin of healthy subjects. Methods Fifty-six healthy men and women aged between 18 and 60 years with Fitzpatrick phototype III-VI skin grade were randomized to receive the topical application (lotion on facial skin) of either Ashwagandha 8% (AG, n=28), or an identical placebo (PL, n=28) for 60 days. The primary outcome was the change from baseline on day 60 in the scores for global physician assessment scoring for the five dermatological signs (skin wrinkles, pores, hydration/moisture, skin brightness/tone, and pigmentation) on facial skin. Secondary outcomes were changes from baseline in the transepidermal water loss (TEWL), melanin index, hydration, and skin elasticity (R2 ratio). Another efficacy outcome was quality of life using the health-specific Short Form Health Survey-12 (SF-12). Safety was assessed using local reactions and adverse events. Three (1 AG, 2 PL) patients were lost to follow-up and per-protocol (PP) data included 53 patients (27 AG, 26 PL). For measurement data, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess treatment effect at different time periods in the PP dataset (n=53). Two groups were compared for differences using a t-test for continuous data or a Mann-Whitney 'U' test for ordinal data. Adverse events were compared between two groups using the chi-square test. Results Greater reduction (p<0.0001) in total physician assessment scores from baseline to day 60 was observed with AG (-74.69%) compared to PL (-48.68%). There was a greater improvement in TEWL, skin hydration, and skin elasticity (R2 ratio) with AG as compared to placebo (p<0.0001). However, the change in melanin index was similar in the two groups at the end of day 60 (p=0.969). The percentage increase in melanin index from baseline to day 60 in the PP dataset was by -2.82% with AG and -1.78% with PL, whereas the percentage reduction in TEWL from baseline to day 60 in the PP dataset was by -15.12% with AG and -8.34% with PL. Similarly, greater percentage improvements were seen with AG as compared to PL for skin hydration (20.66% with AG and 9.5% with PL) and elasticity was assessed by the R2 ratio (16.34% with AG and 3.73% with PL). Adverse events were comparable in the two groups. Conclusions Topical application of a lotion containing Ashwagandha standardized root extract improves the skin condition and quality of life in photoaged healthy individuals. Further studies with different skin types and standard comparators are warranted to substantiate these claims of benefit."

Here, we describe the clinical phenotype of suspected ashwagandha-induced liver injury and the potential causative mechanism. The patient was admitted to the hospital because of jaundice. In the interview, it was reported that he had been taking ashwagandha for a year. Laboratory results showed an increase in total bilirubin, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), (gamma-glutamyl transpherase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total cholesterol, triglycerides, and ferritin. Based on clinical symptoms and additional tests, the patient was diagnosed with acute hepatitis and referred to a facility with a higher reference rate to exclude drug-induced liver injury. An R-value was assessed, indicative of hepatocellular injury. The result of the 24 h urine collection exceeded the upper limit of normal for copper excretion in urine twice. The clinical condition improved after intensive pharmacological treatment and four plasmapheresis treatments. This case is another showing the hepatotoxic potential of ashwagandha to cause cholestatic liver damage mixed with severe jaundice. In view of several documented cases of liver damage caused by ashwagandha and the unknown metabolic molecular mechanisms of substances contained in it, attention should be paid to patients reporting the use of these products in the past and presenting symptoms of liver damage.",

      "abstract": "Early cancer diagnosis through characterizing light propagation and nanotechnology increases the survival rate. The present research is aimed at evaluating the consequence of using natural nanoparticles in cancer therapy and diagnosis. Colon cancer cells were differentiated from the normal cells via investigating light diffusion combined with the fluorescence effect of the Ashwagandha chitosan nanoparticles (Ash C NPs). Ionic gelation technique synthesized the Ash C NPs. High-resolution transmission electron microscope, dynamic light scattering, and zeta potential characterized Ash C NPs. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyzed Ash C NPs, chitosan, and Ashwagandha root water extract. Moreover, the MTT assay evaluated the cytotoxicity of Ash C NPs under the action of near-infrared light (NIR) irradiation. The MTT assay outcomes were statistically analyzed by Bonferroni post hoc multiple two-group comparisons using one-way variance analysis (ANOVA). Based on the Monte-Carlo simulation technique, the spatially resolved steady-state diffusely reflected light from the cancerous and healthy cells is acquired. The diffuse equation reconstructed the optical fluence rate using the finite element technique. The fluorescent effect of the nanoparticles was observed when the cells were irradiated with NIR. The MTT assay revealed a decrease in the cell viability under the action of Ash C NPs with and without laser irradiation. Colon cancer and normal cells were differentiated based on the optical characterization after laser irradiation. The light diffusion equation was successfully resolved for the fluence rate on cells' surfaces showing different normal and cancer cells values. Ash C NPs appeared its fluorescent effect in the presence of NIR laser.",

      "abstract": "Background Poor sexual function is a widespread problem affecting about 40% of women and this may worsen their quality of life. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) an adaptogenic herb has been reported to improve sexual satisfaction, sleep, and quality of life in women. Objective The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of standardized Ashwagandha root extract in improving sexual function in healthy females. Methods In this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 80 women between 18 and 50 years of age without any hormonal disturbances and having hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) with a Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score <26, or Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS) score >11 were randomized to receive either capsule containing standardized Ashwagandha root extract 300mg twice daily (n=40), or identical placebo (n=40) for eight weeks. Sexual function was assessed using FSFI, FSDS, and Satisfying Sexual Encounters (SSEs). Assessments were done at baseline, four weeks, and eight weeks. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed using the general health questionnaire (GHQ-28) scale, and safety was assessed using clinical signs and symptoms. Repeat measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for the assessment of treatment effect at different time periods. Nominal data were analyzed for differences using Fischer's Chi-square test. Results There was statistically significant improvement (p<0.0001) in FSFI scores with Ashwagandha [14.20 (0.98) at baseline to 22.62 (2.06) at week 8] as compared to placebo [14.17 (0.71) at baseline to 19.25 (2.23) at eight weeks], and this improvement was observed in all sub-scales (desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, sexual satisfaction, and pain) of the FSFI scale. There was a greater improvement (p<0.0001) in FSDS scores with AG as compared to placebo. Although not statistically significant (p, 0.078), there was a greater reduction (improvement) in GHQ-28 scores at eight weeks with Ashwagandha as compared to placebo, and this trend was observed for all domains of GHQ-28 (global, physical, psychological, and social function). More women with Ashwagandha had improvement in SSEs at week 4 (p, 0.017) and week 8 (p, 0.002) as compared to placebo. Adverse events were comparable in the two groups. Two women reported nausea and one reported drowsiness with AG, whereas two reported nausea, one reported drowsiness and one reported nausea with drowsiness in the placebo group. Conclusions Oral administration of Ashwagandha 300mg twice daily administered for eight weeks improves the female sexual health in otherwise healthy women who do not have any hormonal disturbances. Ashwagandha is a known adaptogen, maintains general well-being and improves vitality."

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest-growing tumor capable of spreading to other organs via blood vessels formed by endothelial cells. Apoptosis and angiogenesis-targeting therapies are attractive for cancer treatment. In this study, we aimed to study the in vitro cytotoxicity of Withania somnifera against human HCC (HepG2) cells, identify potential antitumoral withanolide glycosides from the active fraction, and elucidate cytotoxic molecular mechanisms of identified bioactive compounds. W. somnifera (Solanaceae), well-known as 'ashwagandha', is an Ayurvedic medicinal plant used to promote health and longevity, and the MeOH extract of W. somnifera root exhibited cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells during initial screening. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the MeOH extract and subsequent phytochemical investigation of the active n-BuOH-soluble fraction resulted in the isolation of five withanolide glycosides (1-5), including one new metabolite, withanoside XIII (1), aided by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based analysis. The new compound structure was determined by 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy, electronic circular dichroism, and enzymatic hydrolysis. In addition, withanoside XIIIa (1a) was identified as the new aglycone (1a) of 1. Isolated withanolide glycosides 1-5 and 1a were cytotoxic toward HepG2 cells; withagenin A diglucoside (WAD) (3) exhibited the most potent cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells, with cell viability less than 50% at 100 μM. WAD cytotoxicity was mediated by both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. Treatment with WAD increased protein expression levels of cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (cleaved PARP) but decreased expression levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). Moreover, WAD inhibited tubular structure formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by inhibiting the protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and its downstream pathways, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). These effects were also enhanced by co-treatment with ERK and PI3K inhibitors. Overall, these results indicate that WAD (3) induced HepG2 apoptosis and inhibited HUVEC tube formation, suggesting its potential application in treating liver cancers."

There is a critical need to build up secure, reliable, and efficient drugs against to the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Bioactive compounds of Ashwagandha [Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal] may implicate as herbal medicine for the management and treatment of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of the current work is to update the knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection and information about the implication of various compounds of medicinal plant Withania somnifera with minimum side effects on the patients' organs. The herbal medicine Withania somnifera has an excellent antiviral activity that could be implicated in the management and treatment of flu and flu-like diseases connected with SARS-CoV-2. The analysis was performed by systematically re-evaluating the published articles related to the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and the herbal medicine Withania somnifera. In the current review, we have provided the important information and data of various bioactive compounds of Withania somnifera such as Withanoside V, Withanone, Somniferine, and some other compounds, which can possibly help in the management and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Withania somnifera has proved its potential for maintaining immune homeostasis of the body, inflammation regulation, pro-inflammatory cytokines suppression, protection of multiple organs, anti-viral, anti-stress, and anti-hypertensive properties. Withanoside V has the potential to inhibit the main proteases (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. At present, synthetic adjuvant vaccines are used against COVID-19.

Sixty healthy students were screened/enrolled into a 30-day double-blinded placebo (PLA)-controlled intervention (700 mg daily, full spectrum extract of ASH root). Anthropometrics, demographics, and validated questionnaires assessing physical activity, restorative sleep, perceived stress, and food cravings were assessed before and after the study. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlations, and point biserial correlations were used to screen the data. For sleep and stress, a nonsignificant mixed (group × time) multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was followed by one-way MANOVA (time on sleep/stress) and one-way multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) (group on sleep/stress, using initial sleep as a covariate) as follow-up tests. Further follow-up tests for this MANCOVA showed group membership affected final sleep (58.4 ± 12.4 vs. 48.2 ± 15.0 ASH vs. PLA respectively, P < .05) using initial sleep as a covariate. Initial sleep (confounder) affected final stress, but not final sleep. Mixed analysis of variance (group × time) showed an interaction effect on food cravings, where the ASH group experienced lower cravings than the PLA group over time at end of study. The 30-day intervention was shorter than most other studies where more pronounced stress differences were seen at six weeks, indicating ASH may need the longer time period to show more pronounced stress relieving differences. ASH can be an effective safe intervention in young adult populations to help manage stress and its detrimental impacts on sleep and satiety in as little as 30 days.

      "abstract": "Stress, anxiety, and depression, along with feeling overwhelmed and exhausted have been widely reported by college students as factors that negatively impact their academic performance, and overall well-being. Ashwagandha is an Ayurvedic herb that has been used historically to support healthy responses to stressors, but has recently gained popularity in the United States for its ability to support well-being for populations who experience chronic stress. To our knowledge, there have not been any human trials evaluating the efficacy of ashwagandha on stress in the United States. No studies to date have used qualitative research methods to consider the experiential impact of ashwagandha supplementation. Our purpose was to explore the lived experiences of college students participating in a double-blind randomized control trial evaluating the impact of ashwagandha as an intervention to support college students' well-being. Participants were college students (N = 60) age 18-50 years, who were randomized to either intervention or placebo group to take one capsule twice a day for 30 days. Intervention group participants took 700 mg of full spectrum extract of ashwagandha root per day, whereas those in the placebo group took glycerol capsules. Qualitative data included daily affect check-ins and focus groups. Data were analyzed using Dedoose qualitative coding software and thematic analysis. Four themes resulted regarding energy levels, mental clarity, sleep dynamics, and stress. Our findings demonstrated that ashwagandha increased college students' perceived well-being through supporting sustained energy, heightened mental clarity, and enhanced sleep quality, through a moderate dose of ashwagandha for the course of 30 days.

It is also an excellent aphrodisiac herb that aids in the improvement and maintenance of normal sexual health. The present study aims to evaluate the effect of ashwagandha root extract on improving sexual health in adult males. METHODS: In this 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we investigated the aphrodisiac property of an ashwagandha root extract in adult males. Fifty participants with lower sexual desire were randomly allocated to take 300 mg of ashwagandha root extract or placebo capsules twice daily. Outcomes were measured using the derogatis interview for sexual functioning-male (DISF-M) questionnaire, serum testosterone, serum prolactin, and short-form survey-36 quality of life questionnaire before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Compared to placebo, ashwagandha root extract supplementation was associated with a statistically significant increase in the total DISF-M scores (mean difference -9.8; 95% confidence interval, -10.73 to -8.87; p < 0.0001; t-test). It was also associated with a statistically significant increase in serum testosterone levels (-66.52; -80.70 to -52.34; p < 0.0001; t-test). However, the prolactin level did not change after intervention in both the ashwagandha and placebo groups (-1.06; -2.78 to 0.66; p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that ashwagandha demonstrated a significant subjective perception of sexual well-being and assisted in increasing serum testosterone levels in the participants."

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is considered a universal public health dilemma in women. Due to the high toxicity and low selectivity of conventional anticancer therapies, there is a growing trend of using plant-derived natural products in cancer prevention and therapy. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera, WS) has been used in the Mediterranean region and Ayurvedic medicine for millennia as a functional food and a medicinal plant with anticancer activity. Besides, intermittent fasting (IF) has been engaged recently in cancer treatment. Hence, the combination of WS and IF provides possible solutions to treat cancer and reduce chemoresistance when combined with chemotherapy. In this study, WS root (WSR), IF, and cisplatin were tested on cisplatin-sensitive (EMT6/P) and cisplatin-resistant (EMT6/CPR) mouse mammary cell lines. The phytochemical content of the WSR extract was analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. Antiproliferative and apoptotic effects were assessed for WSR extract, cisplatin, and their combination in vitro using [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] (MTT) and caspase-3 assays. An in vivo study was used to assess the effect of WSR extract, IF, cisplatin, and their combinations in mice inculcated with EMT6/P and EMT6/CPR cells. The safety profile was also investigated using liver enzymes and creatinine assays. In vitro, WSR extract and cisplatin had a synergistic effect in both cell lines. The same combination induced an apoptotic effect higher than the single treatment in both cell lines. In vivo, several combinations of WSR extract, IF, or cisplatin caused significant tumor size reduction and improved the cure rate in mice implanted with EMT6/P and EMT6/CPR cell lines. IF-treated groups showed a significant reduction in serum glucose and an elevation in β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels. In the safety profile, WSR extract, IF, and their combinations were safe. Overall, the combination of WSR extract and IF provides a promising solution for breast cancer treatment besides cisplatin by reducing the proliferation of cancer cells through induction of apoptosis. Moreover, they minimize cisplatin toxicity to the liver and kidney."

INTERVENTION: The key components of ashwagandha include 12 alkaloids and 35 withanolides, which have been proven in various studies to be beneficial in the treatment of anxiety and stress. While research supports that withanolides and alkaloides work as antidepressants and are the main reason ashwagandha is beneficial for depression, the mechanism of action in unknown. Studies also show that withanolides may bolster the immune system, increase stamina, fight inflammation and infection, combat tumors, reduce stress, revive the libido, protect the liver and soothe jangled nerves. Both of these molecules are steroidal and are similar in action and appearance. Ashwagandha stimulates the activation of immune system cells such as lymphocytes and has also been shown to inhibit inflammation and improve memory in animal experiments.",

Initial investigations revealed a hepatocellular pattern of liver enzyme abnormality with jaundice. Investigations, including viral serology, liver specific autoantibodies and an ultrasound scan of the abdomen, were unremarkable. Liver biopsy showed an acute cholestatic hepatitis with confluent necrosis but no features of chronicity. These histopathological findings differ to that of a previously reported case. Review of recent literature revealed that some clinical features and the time course of liver injury were similar to previous reports of ashwagandha drug-induced liver injury (DILI). The patient received treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid. We compare this case to previous reported cases of ashwagandha DILI and discuss the biochemical and histopathological features of ashwagandha DILI, therapeutic strategies and the importance of recognising herbal supplements as a possible cause of DILI.",

Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal), an essential medicine in Ayurveda, is reportedly beneficial in reducing stress and improving memory. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study evaluated the effect of Ashwagandha root extract sustained-release capsule 300 mg (Prolanza™; hereafter Ashwagandha SR) on cognitive functions, stress levels, sleep quality, overall well-being, and safety in stressed subjects. METHODS: Subjects (130 healthy cognitively sound adults [20-55 years, body mass index:18-29 kg/m2]) having a Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score of 14-24 were randomized to receive either Ashwagandha SR or placebo. Subjects took one capsule of Ashwagandha SR or placebo daily for 90 consecutive days. This study was registered on Clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI) on 13/11/2019 [number: CTRI/2019/11/021990]. The primary endpoint was the change in cognitive function as measured by CANTAB from baseline to the end of the study period (90 ± 7 days). The secondary outcomes included the change in PSS-10 score, serum cortisol level (9-11 am), the OHQ score, the PSQI, and serum BDNF levels. RESULTS: Only 125 completed the study and were evaluated. The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) reported significantly improved recall memory, and the total error rate in recalling patterns significantly decreased at visit 4 in the Ashwagandha SR group vs. the placebo group (first attempt memory score:12.9 ± 6.7 vs. 10.1 ± 6.3; total errors:17.5 ± 23.3 vs. 27.7 ± 23.6). At visit 4, lower PSS-10 score (13.0 ± 5.0 vs. 18.7 ± 4.6; p < .0001), serum cortisol levels (p=0.0443), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score (p < .0001) but higher Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (OHQ) scores (p < .0001) were seen in Ashwagandha SR vs. the placebo group, suggesting significantly lower stress levels and significantly better psychological well-being and sleep quality in the former. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first clinical study assessing Ashwagandha SR for its safety and efficacy. Treatment with one Ashwagandha SR capsule once daily for 90 days improved memory and focus, psychological well-being, and sleep quality, reduced stress levels, and was safe and well-tolerated."

As part of an ongoing investigation for bioactive natural products with novel structures, we performed a phytochemical examination of the roots of W. somnifera employed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based analysis. The chemical analysis of the methanol extract of W. somnifera roots using repeated column chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography under the guidance of an LC/MS-based analysis resulted in a new withanolide, withasomniferol D (1). The structure of the newly isolated compound was elucidated by spectroscopic methods, including one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and high-resolution (HR) electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectroscopy, and its absolute configuration was established by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations. The anti-adipogenic activities of withasomniferol D (1) were evaluated using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with Oil Red O staining and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We found that withasomniferol D (1) inhibited adipogenesis and suppressed the enlargement of lipid droplets compared to the control. Additionally, the mRNA expression levels of adipocyte markers Fabp4 and Adipsin decreased noticeably following treatment with 25 μM of withasomniferol D (1). Taken together, these findings provide experimental evidence that withasomniferol D (1), isolated from W. somnifera, exhibits anti-adipogenic activity, supporting the potential application of this compound in the treatment of obesity and related metabolic diseases."

METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Google Scholars, World Health Organization Trials Portal, ClinicalTrials.gov, Clinical Trial Registry of India, and AYUSH Research Portal for all appropriate trials. Randomized controlled trials that examined the effect of Ashwagandha extract versus placebo on sleep in human participants 18 years old and above were considered. Two authors independently read all trials and independently extracted all relevant data. The primary outcomes were sleep quantity and sleep quality. The secondary outcomes were mental alertness on rising, anxiety level, and quality of life. RESULTS: A total of five randomized controlled trials containing 400 participants were analyzed. Ashwagandha extract exhibited a small but significant effect on overall sleep (Standardized Mean Difference -0.59; 95% Confidence Interval -0.75 to -0.42; I2 =  62%). The effects on sleep were more prominent in the subgroup of adults diagnosed with insomnia, treatment dosage ≥600 mg/day, and treatment duration ≥8 weeks. Ashwagandha extract was also found to improve mental alertness on rising and anxiety level, but no significant effect on quality of life. No serious side effects were reported. CONCLUSION: Ashwagandha extract appears to has a beneficial effect in improving sleep in adults. However, data on the serious adverse effects of Ashwagandha extract are limited, and more safety data would be needed to assess whether it would be safe for long-term use.",

Here, we have investigated the therapeutic prospective of Ashwagandha for the COVID-19 pandemic. Nine withanolides were tested in silico for their potential to target and inhibit (i) cell surface receptor protein (TMPRSS2) that is required for entry of virus to host cells and (ii) viral protein (the main protease Mpro) that is essential for virus replication. We report that the withanolides possess capacity to inhibit the activity of TMPRSS2 and Mpro. Furthermore, withanolide-treated cells showed downregulation of TMPRSS2 expression and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro, suggesting that Ashwagandha may provide a useful resource for COVID-19 treatment.",

W. somnifera (Ashwagandha) is one such plant the extracts of which have been tested against a number of ailments including cancer, which remains as one of the most dreadful diseases on the globe. The ever-increasing number of cancer related mortality demands the development of novel chemopreventive agents with minimum side effects. Different compounds isolated from various parts of the plant like root, stem, and leaves have been reported to display significant anti-cancerous and immunomodulating properties and thus can be used alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs for cancer treatment. Through this review, we highlight the importance of W. somnifera in countering the potential oncogenic signaling mediators that are modulated by active constituents of W. somnifera in a variety of cancer types. Further, we hope that active constituents of W. somnifera will be tested in clinical trials so that they can be used as an important adjuvant in the near future for the effective treatment of cancer.",

Current therapies only provide symptomatic relief, and there is no agent to halt the progression of PD. Previously, Ubisol-Q10, a water-soluble formulation of coenzyme-Q10, and ethanolic root extract of ashwagandha (ASH) have been shown to inhibit PD pathology in rodent models when used alone. Here, we evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of oral administration of ASH and Ubisol-Q10 alone and in combination in a paraquat-induced PD rat model. The combined treatment resulted in better-preserved neuron morphology compared to Ubsiol-Q10 or ASH alone. The combination treatment enhanced activation of pro-survival astroglia and inhibited pro-inflammatory microglia. While anti-oxidative effects were seen with both agents, Ubisol-Q10 activated autophagy, whereas ashwagandha showed a better anti-inflammatory response. Thus, the combined treatment caused inhibition of oxidative stress, autophagy activation, inhibition of pro-inflammatory microglia, and activation of pro-survival astroglia. Consequently, paraquat (PQ)-treated rats given the combination treatment in drinking water did not show motor impairment. Based on these interesting observations, the combined treatment containing two well-tolerated natural compounds could be a more effective strategy to halt the progression of PD."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ashwagandha (ASH) is one of the medicinal plants used in traditional Indian, Ayurvedic, and Unani medicines for their broad range of pharmacological activities including, tonic, aphrodisiac, energy stimulant, and counteracting chronic fatigue. Besides, it is used in the treatment of nervous exhaustion, memory-related conditions, insomnia, as well as improving learning ability and memory capacity. ASH is preclinically proven to be efficient in hepatoprotection and improving cognitive impairment, however, its beneficial effects against hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is still unclear. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating the protective effects of ASH root extract against thioacetamide (TAA)-induced HE and delineate the underlying behavioral and pharmacological mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ASH metabolites were identified using UPLC-HRMS. Rats were pretreated with ASH (200 and 400 mg/kg) for 29 days and administrated TAA (i.p, 350 mg/kg) in a single dose. Then, behavioral (open field test, Y-maze, modified elevated plus maze and novel object recognition test), and biochemical (ammonia and hepatic toxicity indices) assessments, as well as oxidative stress markers (MDA and GSH) were evaluated. The hepatic and brain levels of glutamine synthetase (GS), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme-oxygenase (HO)-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA expressions of p38/ERK½ were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Moreover, histopathological investigations and immunohistochemical (NF-κB and TNF-α immunohistochemical expressions) examinations were performed. RESULTS: Metabolite profiling of ASH revealed more than 45 identified metabolites including phenolic acids, flavonoids and steroidal lactone triterpenoids. Compared to the TAA-intoxicated group, ASH improved the locomotor and cognitive deficits, serum hepatotoxicity indices and ammonia levels, as well as brain and hepatic histopathological alterations. ASH reduced hepatic and brain levels of MDA, GS, and iNOS, and increased their GSH, Nrf2, and HO-1 levels. Also, ASH downregulated p38 and ERK½ mRNA expressions, and NF-κB and TNF-α immunohistochemical expressions in brain and hepatic tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provided insights into the promising hepato- and neuroprotective effects of ASH, with superiority to 400 mg/kg ASH, to ameliorate HE with its sequential hyperammonemia and liver/brain injuries. This could be attributed to the recorded increase in the spontaneous alternation % and recognition index, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, as well as upregulation of Nrf2 and downregualtion of MAPK signaling pathways.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ashwagandha has been used as an ayurvedic medicine in the form of 'Rasayana' (as a tonic) even before 3000 BCE in India. As per Ayurveda, it has long been used traditionally for the treatment of inflammation, weakness, impotence, pulmonary tuberculosis. This plant is also beneficial in lumbago and leucorrhea in the female. In the recent past, Withania has shown its anti-cancerous activity in various experimental models. In addition, Withania also possesses many other properties such as anti-oxidant, anti-stress, adaptogenic, and regenerative which will eventually be beneficial and safe in treating cancer patients. AIM OF THE STUDY: This review aims to provide experimental evidence along with a deeper insight into molecular mechanisms of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal) through which it acts as a chemotherapeutic agent against different types of breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature searches with the help of electronic online databases (Elsevier, Google Scholar, Scopus, Springer Link, ScienceDirect, ResearchGate, PubMed) were carried out. The timeline for collection of data for the review article was from 2000 to 2019. The plant name was validated from The Plant List (2013). Version 1.1. Published on http://www.theplantlist.org/(accessed 21st March 2020). RESULTS: Various forms of Withania somnifera were used and several in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies were reported by researchers. They found ashwagandha to exhibit anti-apoptotic, anti-metastatic, anti-invasive and anti-inflammatory properties and gave the evidence that ashwagandha has a capability for averting and treating breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Various in vitro and in vivo studies suggested Ashwagandha may possess a potential for treating breast cancer, especially ER/PR positive breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. A clinical trial has also been conducted in the past that suggested its potential in refining quality of life in breast cancer patients. Studies directed towards molecular pathways have helped in unravelling the key mechanisms of ashwagandha. Future research should be directed towards translational studies involving breast cancer patients. These will reinforce the ancient power of our Ayurvedic medicine.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is a well-established and reputed herb in Ayurvedic medicine. It has been used as a \"Rasayana\" (rejuvenator), nootropic, and as a powerful natural adaptogen. The herb extract is extensively used for general wellbeing and in specific ailments. However, only a few studies have investigated the safety and tolerability of Ashwagandha in humans. This study evaluated the safety of Ashwagandha root extract consumption in healthy adults. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and parallel-group study, 80 healthy participants (40 males, 40 females) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Ashwagandha 300 mg or a placebo of the same dosage, twice daily, orally for 8 weeks. The study was conducted at MV Hospital, and King George Medical University, Lucknow, India. The primary safety outcomes considered were laboratory assessment of hematological parameters, serum biochemistry analysis including hepatotoxicity evaluation, and thyroid function parameters. The secondary outcomes of this study were the clinical adverse events and the vital parameters. The within and between the groups' datasets were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Mann Whitney U test, respectively. RESULTS: A detailed evaluation of the vital signs such as body weight, body temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and Body Mass Index (BMI) were conducted for each participant at the baseline and the end of the study for treatment and placebo groups. Similarly, hematological and biochemical parameters were evaluated at the baseline and at the end of study. The outcome did not indicate any untoward effects in any of the treated volunteers. No statistically significant change or abnormality was observed in the considered parameters including thyroid hormonal profile in both the groups. No adverse events were reported by any of the participants in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Ashwagandha is being consumed since time immemorial following the Ayurvedic medicine practices. Modern science requires evidence of the safety and efficacy of the Ashwagandha extract before mass consumption for various health issues and as a supplement. The present study revealed that the consumption of Ashwagandha root extract for 8 weeks was safe in both males and females volunteers. However, long term study and varying dosage ranges should be investigated in the future.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal.) is long known for its sleep-inducing effects. Ashwagandha can be proposed as an alternative to the recommended present treatments for insomnia. This study aimed to evaluate the pharmacological effect of Ashwagandha root extract on sleep in healthy subjects and also in the subjects having insomnia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a randomized, parallel-group, stratified design, placebo-controlled study. A total of 80 eligible participants, 40 in Arm-A (healthy) and 40 in Arm-B (insomnia) were assigned to two groups, either Ashwagandha or placebo and studied for 8-weeks. The assessment was done based on the sleep parameters (Sleep Onset Latency, Total Sleep Time, Wake After Sleep Onset, Total time in bed, and Sleep Efficiency), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Hamilton Anxiety scale-A questionnaire, mental alertness on rising assessment, and sleep quality questionnaire. Safety and adverse events along with the concomitant medication were also assessed. RESULTS: In both healthy and insomnia subjects, there was a significant improvement in the sleep parameters in the Ashwagandha root extract supplemented group. The improvement was found more significant in insomnia subjects than healthy subjects. Repeat measure Analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirmed the significant improvement in SOL (p 0.013), HAM-A outcomes (p < 0.05), mental alertness (p 0.01), and sleep quality (p < 0.05) of the insomnia patients. A two-way ANOVA was used to confirm the outcomes that denoted sleep onset latency (p < 0.0001) and sleep efficiency (p < 0.0001) as the most improved parameters, followed by TST (p < 0.002) and WASO(p < 0.040). All these parameters (SOL, TST, WASO, TIB, SE, PSQI, HAM-A, Mental Alertness, and Sleep quality) were also statistically assessed for the significant improvement within the group both for the treatment, and the placebo groups in the healthy and the insomnia datasets. Obtained results suggest statistically significant (p < 0.0001) changes between the baseline values and the end of the study results except for the HAM-A and the mental alertness scoresn the healthy subject group. CONCLUSION: The present study confirms that Ashwagandha root extract can improve sleep quality and can help in managing insomnia. Ashwagandha root extract was well tolerated by all the participants irrespective of their health condition and age. Additional clinical trials are required to generalize the outcome.",

Elderly due to the predominant Vata Dosha in the body are easily affected by this problem. Brimhana Nasya (nourishing nasal drop) with Ksheera Bala Taila and oral administration of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal) root powder both are indicated in Ayurvedic classics for the management of insomnia. AIM: To determine the combined efficacy of oral administration of Ashwagandha root powder along with Brimhana Nasya with Ksheera Bala Taila in primary insomnia in geriatric. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was randomized, open-label clinical study conducted at the hospital of Pt. Khushilal Sharma Government Ayurveda College and Institute Bhopal. Randomly selected 60 elderly patients with primary insomnia were randomly divided into two groups (30 in each group). Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to assess the symptoms of primary insomnia. Relief in the subjective symptoms was assessed in percentage. Then, the statistical significance of result within the group was assessed using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test and the comparative effect of therapy in both groups was assessed using Mann-Whitney test. Graph Pad InStat-3 software was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: On subjective sleep quality 86.66% relief with P < 0.0001, on sleep latency 60.02% improvement with P < 0.0001, improvement in sleep duration was reported in 89.15% of patients with P < 0.0001 and improvement in sleep efficiency was reported in 90.14% of patients with statistically extremely significant P < 0.0001 were observed in combined therapy group (Ksheera Bala Taila Brimhana Nasya along with oral administration of Ashwagandha root powder). While 38.66% improvement in sleep efficiency, 40.39% relief in sleep disturbances and 37.05% improvement on subjective sleep quality was reported in group B patients, i.e., Ashwagandha root powder group. CONCLUSION: In 30 days treatment combined therapy was found more effective in the management of primary insomnia in the elderly compared with Ashwagandha root powder alone."

This is the first human study in which an extract of ashwagandha (Withania somnifera Dunal L.) was evaluated for effects in improving overall sleep quality in subjects with NRS. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 150 healthy subjects scoring high on non-restorative sleep measures were given 120 mg of standardized ashwagandha extract (Shoden®) once daily for six weeks. Subjects were evaluated using the Restorative Sleep Questionnaire-weekly version and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Bref (WHOQOL) scale. Sleep actigraphy was used to measure the onset of sleep latency, sleep efficiency, total sleep time and wake after sleep onset. Safety of the treatment was determined by testing of vitals, hematology, biochemistry and urinalysis. RESULTS: A total of 144 subjects completed the study, with no dropouts due to adverse events. A 72% increase in self-reported sleep quality was found for the treatment group, compared with 29% in the placebo group (p < 0.001). Based on activity monitoring data, the treatment group showed significant improvement in sleep efficiency (SE) (p < 0.01), total sleep time (p < 0.001) and sleep latency (p < 0.01) and wake after sleep onset (WASO) (p < 0.05) versus placebo after six weeks. In the ashwagandha group quality of life (QOL) scores showed significant improvement in physical (p < 0.001), psychological (p < 0.001), and environment domains (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with the standardized ashwagandha extract for six weeks improved the overall quality of sleep by significantly improving the NRS condition in healthy subjects.

A systematic search was conducted in three electronic databases following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Guidelines (PRISMA). The inclusion criteria were: (a) VO2max data, with means ± standard deviation before and after the supplement intervention, (b) the study was randomized controlled trial (RCT), (c) the article was written in English. The quality of evidence was evaluated according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. A meta-analysis was performed to determine effect sizes. Five studies were selected in the systematic review (162 participants) and four were included in the meta-analysis (142 participants). Results showed a significant enhancement in VO2max in healthy adults and athletes (p = 0.04). The mean difference was 3.00 (95% CI from 0.18 to 5.82) with high heterogeneity. In conclusion, Ashwagandha supplementation might improve the VO2max in athlete and non-athlete people. However, further research is need to confirm this hypothesis since the number of studies is limited and the heterogeneity was high.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Withania somnifera (Family: Solanaceae), commonly known as Ashwagandha or Indian ginseng is distributed widely in India, Nepal, China and Yemen. The roots of plant consist of active phytoconstituents mainly withanolides, alkaloids and sitoindosides and are conventionally used for the treatment of multiple brain disorders. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This review aims to critically assess and summarize the current state and implication of Ashwagandha in brain disorders. We have mainly focussed on the reported neuroactive phytoconstituents, available marketed products, pharmacological studies, mechanism of action and recent patents published related to neuroprotective effects of Ashwagandha in brain disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All the information and data was collected on Ashwagandha using keywords \"Ashwagandha\" along with \"Phytoconstituents\", \"Ayurvedic, Unani and Homeopathy marketed formulation\", \"Brain disorders\", \"Mechanism\" and \"Patents\". Following sources were searched for data collection: electronic scientific databases such as Science Direct, Google Scholar, Elsevier, PubMed, Wiley On-line Library, Taylor and Francis, Springer; books such as AYUSH Pharmacopoeia; authentic textbooks and formularies. RESULTS: Identified neuroprotective phytoconstituents of Ashwagandha are sitoindosides VII-X, withaferin A, withanosides IV, withanols, withanolide A, withanolide B, anaferine, beta-sitosterol, withanolide D with key pharmacological effects in brain disorders mainly anxiety, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, dyslexia, depression, autism, addiction, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorders. The literature survey does not highlight any toxic effects of Ashwagandha. Further, multiple available marketed products and patents recognized its beneficial role in various brain disorders; however, very few data is available on mechanistic pathway and clinical studies of Ashwagandha for various brain disorders is scarce and not promising. CONCLUSION: The review concludes the results of recent studies on Ashwagandha suggesting its extensive potential as neuroprotective in various brain disorders as supported by preclinical studies, clinical trials and published patents. However vague understanding of the mechanistic pathways involved in imparting the neuroprotective effect of Ashwagandha warrants further study to promote it as a promising drug candidate.",

      "abstract": "Background Ashwagandha is an excellent adaptogen that is being used since ancient times in Ayurvedic medicine. Traditionally, it is used for various ailments and general well-being, including the treatment of geriatric patients. Managing quality of life (QoL) remains a challenge for the elderly population, especially joint pain management, sleep, and general well-being. With a growing global elderly population, QoL management with efficient medication and supplementation is the major healthcare requirement. Objective The objective of this study was to assess the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal.) root extract on the improvement of general health and sleep in elderly people. Methods This 12-week, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted on individuals of either gender aged between 65-80 years. Participants were randomized to receive Ashwagandha root extract at a dose of 600 mg/day (n = 25) orally, or identical placebo capsules with the same dose (n = 25) for 12 weeks. Efficacy was assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire, sleep quality, mental alertness on rising, and Physician's Global Assessment of Efficacy to Therapy (PGAET). The safety and tolerability were assessed using the clinical adverse events reporting and Patient's Global Assessment of Tolerability to Therapy (PGATT). Results Statistically significant (P<0.0001) improvement was observed in the Ashwagandha treatment group compared to the placebo. The mean (SD) total score of WHOQOL-BREF improved from 140.53 (8.25) at the baseline to 161.84(9.32) at the end of the study. The individual domain scores were also improved. At baseline, the sleep quality and the mental alertness on rising were comparatively low in both the groups. However, upon intervention, a significant increase in the quality of sleep (P<0.0001) and mental alertness (P<0.034) was observed in the Ashwagandha treatment group when compared to the placebo group. Overall improvement was observed for the general wellbeing, sleep quality, and mental alertness in the study population. The experimental group population displayed good tolerability to the test product and it was reported as safe and beneficial by the study participants.  Conclusion The study outcomes suggest that Ashwagandha root extract was efficient in improving the QoL, sleep quality, and mental alertness as self-assessed by the elderly participants. The recommended dose used in this study could be effective for the elderly population."

      "abstract": "Background Stress, anxiety and impeded sleep are a frequent feature of life in modern societies. Across socio-economic strata, stress, anxiety and ineffective sleep detract from healthful living and serve as precursors of various ailments. The use of herbs to offset these antecedents and outcomes has greatly increased in recent years. Ashwagandha, an adaptogenic Ayurvedic herb, has been often used to combat and reduce stress and thereby enhance general wellbeing. While there have been other studies documenting the use of Ashwagandha for stress resistance, this is the first study to use a high-concentration root extract while also varying the dosage substantially. Therefore, this is the first study to offer insight into dose-response of a high concentration root extract. Material and methods In this eight-week, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the stress-relieving effect of Ashwagandha root extract was investigated in stressed healthy adults. Sixty male and female participants with a baseline perceived stress scale (PSS) score >20 were randomized to receive capsules of Ashwagandha extract 125 mg, Ashwagandha extract 300 mg or identical placebo twice daily for eight weeks in a 1:1:1 ratio. Stress was assessed using PSS at baseline, four weeks and eight weeks. Anxiety was assessed using the Hamilton-Anxiety (HAM-A) scale and serum cortisol was measured at baseline and at eight weeks. Sleep quality was assessed using a seven-point sleep scale. A repeat measures ANOVA (general linear model) was used for assessment of treatment effect at different time periods. Post-hoc Dunnett's test was used for comparison of two treatments with placebo. Results Two participants (one each in 250 mg/day Ashwagandha and placebo) were lost to follow-up and 58 participants completed the study. A significant reduction in PSS scores was observed with Ashwagandha 250 mg/day (P < 0.05) and 600 mg/day (P < 0.001). Serum cortisol levels reduced with both Ashwagandha 250 mg/day (P < 0.05) and Ashwagandha 600 mg/day (P < 0.0001). Compared to the placebo group participants, the participants receiving Ashwagandha had significant improvement in sleep quality. Conclusion Ashwagandha root aqueous extract was beneficial in reducing stress and anxiety."

      "abstract": "Introduction Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder that can profoundly impact a person's physical health and mental wellbeing. Most of the currently available drugs for insomnia exert adverse effects. Hence, alternative herbal therapies could be effective in treating insomnia. Ashwagandha, a proven \"Rasayana\" from ancient Ayurveda is having the required potential to treat insomnia. Objective To determine the efficacy and safety of Ashwagandha root extract in patients with insomnia and anxiety. Methods This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted at Prakruti Hospital, Kalwa, Maharashtra, India. A total of 60 patients were randomly divided into two groups: test (n = 40) and placebo (n = 20) in a randomization ratio of 2:1. Test product was a capsule containing highest concentration full-spectrum Ashwagandha root extract 300 mg, and the placebo was an identical capsule containing starch. Both treatments were given twice daily with milk or water for 10 weeks. Sleep actigraphy (Respironics Philips) was used for assessment of sleep onset latency (SOL), total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE) and wake after sleep onset (WASO). Other assessments were total time in bed (sleep log), mental alertness on rising, sleep quality, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) scales. Results Two patients, one from each group, did not complete study and the per-protocol dataset (n = 58) included 29 and 19 patients from test and placebo, respectively. The baseline parameters were similar in the two groups at baseline. The sleep onset latency was improved in both test and placebo at five and 10 weeks. However, the SOL was significantly shorter (p, 0.019) after 10 weeks with test [29.00 (7.14)] compared to placebo [33.94 (7.65)]. Also, significant improvement in SE scores was observed with Ashwagandha which was 75.63 (2.70) for test at the baseline and increased to 83.48 (2.83) after 10 weeks, whereas for placebo the SE scores changed from 75.14 (3.73) at baseline to 79.68 (3.59) after 10 weeks. Similarly, significant improvement in sleep quality was observed with test compared to placebo (p, 0.002). Significant improvement was observed in all other sleep parameters, i.e., SOL, SE, PSQI and anxiety (HAM-A scores) with Ashwagandha root extract treatment for 10 weeks. Conclusion Ashwagandha root extract is a natural compound with sleep-inducing potential, well tolerated and improves sleep quality and sleep onset latency in patients with insomnia at a dose of 300 mg extract twice daily. It could be of potential use to improve sleep parameters in patients with insomnia and anxiety, but need further large-scale studies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal) is a herb traditionally used to reduce stress and enhance wellbeing. The aim of this study was to investigate its anxiolytic effects on adults with self-reported high stress and to examine potential mechanisms associated with its therapeutic effects. METHODS: In this 60-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study the stress-relieving and pharmacological activity of an ashwagandha extract was investigated in stressed, healthy adults. Sixty adults were randomly allocated to take either a placebo or 240 mg of a standardized ashwagandha extract (Shoden) once daily. Outcomes were measured using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale -21 (DASS-21), and hormonal changes in cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEA-S), and testosterone. RESULTS: All participants completed the trial with no adverse events reported. In comparison with the placebo, ashwagandha supplementation was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the HAM-A (P = .040) and a near-significant reduction in the DASS-21 (P = .096). Ashwagandha intake was also associated with greater reductions in morning cortisol (P < .001), and DHEA-S (P = .004) compared with the placebo. Testosterone levels increased in males (P = .038) but not females (P = .989) over time, although this change was not statistically significant compared with the placebo (P = .158). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ashwagandha's stress-relieving effects may occur via its moderating effect on the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. However, further investigation utilizing larger sample sizes, diverse clinical and cultural populations, and varying treatment dosages are needed to substantiate these findings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice groups treated orally with 10 mg/kg TEG or WFWS (3.3, 10, 33.3, or 100 mg/kg) for 12 consecutive days were subjected to foot shock stress-triggered hyperthermia test on the 1st, 5th, 7th and 10th day and to marble-burying test on the following 2 days. Effects of treatment on stress-triggered alteration in body weight, core temperature, blood glucose, insulin and cortisol level were quantified and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: WFWS doses up to 10 mg/kg/day were as effective as TEG in affording protection against stress-triggered alteration in body weight, core temperature and marble-burying behavior. Protection against stress-triggered alteration in blood glucose and insulin level, as well as antidepressants or anxiolytic-like activities in the behavioral test, were observed in the higher two WFWS doses (33.3 and 100 mg/kg) treated groups only. CONCLUSION: Ashwagandha metabolites other than withanolides contribute to its stress resistance increasing effects. The observations suggest that modulation of physiological functions of gut microbiota may be involved in the mode of action of Withania somnifera root extracts."

This target was performed through induction of animal model of hypothyroidism by propylthiouracil. After 1 month from treatments, blood samples were collected for biochemical determinations, and liver and kidney were removed for the determination of oxidative stress markers and thyroid gland was removed for histopathological examination. The total phenolic compounds in the extract and the in vitro radical scavenging activity of extract were also determined. The results revealed that the induction of hypothyroidism by propylthiouracil induced a significant increase in serum TSH level but it induced significant decreases in the levels of total T3, free T3, free T4, and total T4 hormones compared with the control values. Also, serum glucose, Il-6, and body weight gain increased significantly while Il-10 and blood hemoglobin levels showed significant decrease. Induction of hypothyroidism increased also the levels of hepatic and renal MDA and NO and decreased significantly the values of GSH, GPx and Na+/ K+-ATPase. Both AME and the anti-hypothyroidism drug significantly ameliorated the changes occurred in the levels of the above parameters and improved histological picture of thyroid gland but with different degrees; where ashwagandha methanolic extract showed the strongest effect. We can conclude that ashwagandha methanolic extract treatment improves thyroid function by ameliorating thyroid hormones and by preventing oxidative stress.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tumor suppressor p53 protein is frequently mutated in a large majority of cancers. These mutations induce local or global changes in protein structure thereby affecting its binding to DNA. The structural differences between the wild type and mutant p53 thus provide an opportunity to selectively target mutated p53 harboring cancer cells. Restoration of wild type p53 activity in mutants using small molecules that can revert the structural changes have been considered for cancer therapeutics. METHODS: We used bioinformatics and molecular docking tools to investigate the structural changes between the wild type and mutant p53 proteins (p53V143A, p53R249S, p53R273H and p53Y220C) and explored the therapeutic potential of Withaferin A and Withanone for restoration of wild type p53 function in cancer cells. Cancer cells harboring the specific mutant p53 proteins were used for molecular assays to determine the mutant or wild type p53 functions. RESULTS: We found that p53V143A mutation does not show any significant structural changes and was also refractory to the binding of withanolides. p53R249S mutation critically disturbed the H-bond network and destabilized the DNA binding site. However, withanolides did not show any selective binding to either this mutant or other similar variants. p53Y220C mutation created a cavity near the site of mutation with local loss of hydrophobicity and water network, leading to functionally inactive conformation. Mutated structure could accommodate withanolides suggesting their conformational selectivity to target p53Y220C mutant. Using human cell lines containing specific p53 mutant proteins, we demonstrated that Withaferin A, Withanone and the extract rich in these withanolides caused restoration of wild type p53 function in mutant p53Y220C cells. This was associated with induction of p21WAF-1-mediated growth arrest/apoptosis. CONCLUSION: The study suggested that withanolides may serve as highly potent anticancer compounds for treatment of cancers harboring a p53Y220C mutation.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine if adjunctive treatment with a standardized extract of Withania somnifera (WSE), with known anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties, improves psychopathology and stress in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV-TR). METHODS: Patients experiencing an exacerbation of symptoms were assigned to WSE (1,000 mg/d) or placebo for 12 weeks, added to their antipsychotic medication, in a random-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted from April 2013 to July 2016. Primary outcomes were change from baseline to end of treatment on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS total, positive, negative, and general symptoms) between treatment groups. Secondary outcomes evaluated stress and inflammatory indices using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), and C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: Sixty-six randomized patients (n = 33 per group) provided efficacy data. Beginning at 4 weeks and continuing to the end of treatment, WSE produced significantly greater reductions in PANSS negative, general, and total symptoms (Cohen d: 0.83, 0.76, 0.83), but not positive symptoms, when compared to placebo. PSS scores improved significantly with WSE treatment compared to placebo (Cohen d: 0.58). CRP and S100B declined more in the WSE group but were not significantly different from placebo. Adverse events were mild to moderate and transient; somnolence, epigastric discomfort, and loose stools were more common with WSE. No significant between-treatment differences were noted in body weight, vital signs, or laboratory measures, which remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: This early study suggests that adjunctive treatment with a standardized extract of Withania somnifera provides significant benefits, with minimal side effects, for negative, general, and total symptoms and stress in patients with recent exacerbation of schizophrenia.

Among the sleep disturbances, NRS has been little studied in the general population, even though this symptom plays an important role in several medical conditions associated with chronic inflammation such as heart disease, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome, as well as various sleep disorders. There is paucity in the literature about effective treatments for NRS. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) has been demonstrated to reduce anxiety and stress, allowing the body to settle down and prepare for sleep. This study will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled interventional study in NRS population.The NRS participants are identified using Restorative Sleep Questionnaire-weekly version (RSQ-W) questionnaire. Actigraphy and polysomnography are used for the objective assessment of sleep. The other assessments used are Hamilton Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) scales, and C-reactive protein. Routine blood and urine analyses will be conducted to assess the safety of treatment. Duration of study for each participant will be 50 days with \"day one\" for screening followed by randomization for the treatment. The duration for medicine/placebo intake shall be 42 days.Primary outcome will be to evaluate effect of daily supplement of ashwagandha extract compared with placebo in subjects with NRS at 6 weeks from baseline, as assessed by the total score of RSQ-W.

However, the effects of the hot water extract of Ashwagandha roots (ASH‑WEX), which is also used in Ayurveda, on skin have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, the present study investigated the anti‑inflammatory activity of ASH‑WEX on skin, by using the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. The results indicated that ASH‑WEX significantly inhibited mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)‑8, IL‑6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF‑α), IL‑1β and IL‑12, and promoted the mRNA expression of the anti‑inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)‑β1 in HaCaT cells. In addition, ASH‑WEX inhibited the lipopolysaccharide‑induced phosphorylation of p38 and c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase, as well as the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (NF)‑κB p65. Downregulation of TNF‑α mRNA and upregulation of TGF‑β1 mRNA were also observed in vivo following ASH‑WEX treatment of mouse skin. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the anti‑inflammatory effect of ASH‑WEX may be due to its ability to suppress the NF‑κB and mitogen‑activated protein kinase pathways, and to modulate cytokine expression. These results suggest that ASH‑WEX can potentially protect against skin inflammation.",

Methods After treating HepG2cells with Ashwagandha water extract (ASH-WX; 6.25 mg/ml-100 mg/ml), cell proliferation was assessed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Antioxidant activities (total antioxidant, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase), Fas-ligand level, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) level and caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities were measured. Molecular modelling assessed the binding-free energies of Ashwagandha in the cyclin D1 receptor. Results The MTT assay demonstrated increased cytotoxicity following treatment of HepG2 cells with ASH-WX compared with control untreated cells and theIC50was 5% (approximately 5.0 mg/ml). Antioxidant activities, Fas-ligand levels and caspase-3, -8 and -9 activities significantly increased, while TNF-α level significantly decreased following ASH-WX treatment compared with control untreated cells. Molecular docking analysis revealed a good prediction of binding between cyclin D1 and Ashwagandha.

      "abstract": "To manage male infertility caused by hormonal imbalance, infections and other predicaments, multifarious treatment strategies are emerging worldwide. Contemporary treatments, such as assisted reproductive techniques, are costly with low success rates of only 10-30%; however, herbal remedies are gaining more attention as an alternative or supplementary therapeutic modality for male infertility. The beneficial effects induced by oral intake of the roots of a small evergreen shrub, Withania sominifera (Ashwagandha) on semen quality of infertile men have previously been studied. Oral intake of Ashwagandha roots has been found to inhibit lipid peroxidation, improve sperm count and motility, and regulate reproductive hormone levels. The molecular mechanisms of these effects, however, are yet to be unveiled. In this review, we will discuss the role of herbal medicines in male infertility; provide a detailed analysis of various human and animal studies involving Withania somnifera; describe a proposed direct oxidative mechanism involving mitigation of oxidative stress as well as an indirect mechanism consisting of a gamma-aminobutyric acid-like-mimetic pathway ameliorating hormonal balance through crosstalk among different endocrine glands to improve male fertility; and how Withania somnifera supplementation mitigates risk factor-induced male infertility as well as ameliorates male fertility.",

      "abstract": "The root of Withania somnifera, commonly known as ashwagandha, is a traditional herb in the Indian Ayurvedic system of medicine and is used as a tonic. Here, we investigated whether W. somnifera root extract exhibits analgesic effects in plantar incision (PI) and spared nerve injury (SNI) rat models. Mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) was measured by von Frey filaments, and pain-related behavior was determined after operation by ultrasonic vocalization (USV) measurements. Indeed, we examined interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels in the isolated dorsal root ganglia (DRG) following SNI in rats using an ELISA cytokine assay. MWT significantly increased 6 and 24 h after PI in rats receiving W. somnifera root extracts (100 and 300 mg/kg). Furthermore, the number of 22-27-kHz USV, which are a distress response, was significantly reduced at 6 and 24 h after PI in W. somnifera-treated rats (100 and 300 mg/kg). SNI-induced hyperalgesia and cytokine levels were significantly alleviated after treating with W. somnifera root extracts (100 and 300 mg/kg) for 15 continuous days. The main active compound, withaferin A, from the W. somnifera root extract has shown the CC chemokine family Receptor 2 (CCR2) antagonistic effects on monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)-induced Ca2+ response in CCR2 stable cell line. These results indicate that W. somnifera root extract has a potential analgesic effect in rat models for both postoperative and neuropathic pain and shows potential as a drug or supplement for the treatment of pain.",

Ashwagandha [Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal], a traditional medicine in Ayurveda, is often prescribed for thyroid dysfunctions. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ashwagandha root extract in subclinical hypothyroid patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, single-center placebo-controlled study was performed at Sudbhawana Hospital, Varanasi, India between May 2016 and September 2016. Fifty subjects with elevated serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (4.5-10 μIU/L) aged between 18 and 50 were randomized in either treatment (n = 25) or placebo (n = 25) groups for an 8-week treatment period. INTERVENTIONS: Ashwagandha root extract (600 mg daily) or starch as placebo. Efficacy Variables: Serum TSH, serum triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroxine (T4) levels. RESULTS: A total of four subjects (two from each group) withdrew their consent before the second visit. Eight weeks of treatment with ashwagandha improved serum TSH (p < 0.001), T3 (p = 0.0031), and T4 (p = 0.0096) levels significantly compared to placebo. Ashwagandha treatment effectively normalized the serum thyroid indices during the 8-week treatment period in a significant manner (time-effects: TSH [p < 0.001], T3 [p < 0.001], and T4 [p < 0.001]). Four subjects (8%) (ashwagandha: 1[4%]; Placebo: 3[12%]) out of 50 reported few mild and temporary adverse effects during this study. CONCLUSION: Treatment with ashwagandha may be beneficial for normalizing thyroid indices in subclinical hypothyroid patients.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Herbomineral formulations are momentous in an audience of worldwide by virtue of their holistic approach to life. These formulations are widely used as complementary therapies in immunocompromised patients including cancer. Still, there is the need of cost-effective and safe herbomineral-based formulation that can modulate immune response by the regulation of cytokines cascades. OBJECTIVE: Current study, we investigated immunomodulatory effect of TEBEH in LPS-induced cytokines expression levels in mouse splenocytes in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The most effective and safe concentrations of TEBEH were chosen by determining the cell viability of splenocytes using MTT assay. The pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, MIP-1α, and IFN-γ were measured in cell supernatants using ELISA. RESULTS: MTT data showed TEBEH formulation was found safe up to 10.53 μg/mL. At noncytotoxic concentrations (0.00001053-10.53 μg/mL), TEBEH significantly (P ≤ 0.001) inhibited the expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β, and MIP-1α in mouse splenocytes as compared with vehicle control. CONCLUSION: In summary, TEBEH may indeed promote an anti-inflammatory environment by suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These observations indicated that TEBEH has potential effects in downregulating the immune system and might be developed as a useful anti-inflammatory product for various inflammatory disorders. SUMMARY: The present study was undertaken to evaluate an immunomodulatory effect of the herbomineral formulation in LPS-induced mouse splenocytes with the measurement of cytokines expression such as TNF-α, IL-1β, MIP-1α and IFN-γ. The results showed that the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and MIP-1α was significantly down-regulated while, IFN-γ was significantly up-regulated in mouse splenocytes. It is hypothesized that modulation of the proinflammatory cytokines might occur via NF-κB pathway. Therefore, the herbomineral test formulation might act as an effective anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory product, and this can be used as a complementary and alternative treatment for the prevention of various types of inflammatory and auto-immune disorders Abbreviations used: LPS: Lipopolysaccharide, IL: Interleukin; NF-κB: Nuclear factor kappa-B, TNF-α: Tumor necrosis factor alpha, MIP-1α: Macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, IFN-γ: Interferon, MTT: 3-(4,5-diamethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2Htetrazolium), ELISA: Enzyme linked immune sorbent assay, ANOVA: Analysis of variance."

Most of currently available drugs for insomnia develop dependency and/or adverse effects. Hence natural therapies could be an alternative choice of treatment for insomnia. The root or whole plant extract of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) has been used to induce sleep in Indian system of traditional home medicine, Ayurveda. However, its active somnogenic components remain unidentified. We investigated the effect of various components of Ashwagandha leaf on sleep regulation by oral administration in mice. We found that the alcoholic extract that contained high amount of active withanolides was ineffective to induce sleep in mice. However, the water extract which contain triethylene glycol as a major component induced significant amount of non-rapid eye movement sleep with slight change in rapid eye movement sleep. Commercially available triethylene glycol also increased non-rapid eye movement sleep in mice in a dose-dependent (10-30 mg/mouse) manner. These results clearly demonstrated that triethylene glycol is an active sleep-inducing component of Ashwagandha leaves and could potentially be useful for insomnia therapy.",

Roots of Ashwagandha have been traditionally known to possess a variety of therapeutic and health promoting potentials that have not been sufficiently supported by laboratory studies. Nevertheless, most, if not all, of the preventive and therapeutic potentials have been assigned to its bioactive components, steroidal alkaloids and lactones. In contrast to the traditional use of roots, we have been exploring bioactivities in leaves of Ashwagandha. Here, we report that the leaves possess higher content of active Withanolides, Withaferin-A (Wi-A) and Withanone (Wi-N), as compared to the roots. We also established, for the first time, hydroponic cultivation of Ashwagandha and investigated the effect of various cultivation conditions on the content of Wi-A and Wi-N by chemical analysis and bioassays. We report that the Withanone/Withaferin A-rich leaves could be obtained by manipulating light condition during hydroponic cultivation. Furthermore, we recruited cyclodextrins to prepare extracts with desired ratio of Wi-N and Wi-A. Hydroponically grown Ashwagandha and its extracts with high ratio of withanolides are valuable for cancer treatment.",

PURPOSE: However, the exact mechanism through which Ashwagandha demonstrates these effects is still unknown. METHODS: In the present study, we hypothesized that the alcoholic extract of Ashwagandha leaves (i-Extract) possesses cholinergic properties, which in turn inhibit the anti-cholinergic nature of scopolamine. Therefore, the potential of i-Extract to recover from the scopolamine-induced cholinergic deficits was assessed by measuring acetylcholine (neurotransmitter) and Arc (synaptic activity-related gene) expression level in the mouse brain. RESULTS: The enzymatic activity of acetyl cholinesterase and choline acetyltransferase was assessed through colorimetric assays, and expression level of Arc protein was examined by Western blotting. Furthermore, mRNA level of these genes was examined by semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR. We observed that the treatment of i-Extract in scopolamine-induced amnesic mouse attenuates scopolamine-induced detrimental alterations in the cholinergic system. CONCLUSION: Thus, our study provided biochemical and molecular evidence of cholinergic properties of Ashwagandha leaf extract during brain disorders associated with cholinergic dysfunction."

The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of Withania somnifera (W. somnifera) root extract as an adjunct therapy to standard OCD treatment. METHODS: Thirty patients with a confirmed diagnosis of OCD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria participated in this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial and were randomly assigned to the treatment group (W. somnifera extract, 120mg/day; n=15) or the placebo group (n=15). All patients were under treatment with Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), and were instructed to take 4 capsules of the extract or placebo per day, preferably after meals, for a period of six weeks. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was used in order to assess the severity of OCD symptoms at baseline and at the end of the trial. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software and Y-BOCS values were presented as median and range (Min-Max). RESULTS: Comparison of the change in Y-BOCS score during the course of the trial revealed a significantly greater effect of W. somnifera (26 (14-40) [pre-treatment] versus 14 (4-40) [post-treatment]; change: -8 (-23 to 0)) versus placebo (18 (11-33) [pre-treatment] versus 16 (10-31) [post-treatment]; change: -2 (-4 to 0)) (P<0.001). The extract was safe and no adverse event was reported during the trial. CONCLUSION: W. somnifera extract may be beneficial as a safe and effective adjunct to SSRIs in the treatment of OCD.",

The identification of strategies to alleviate inflammation may have translational impact to attenuate kidney disease. METHODS: We tested the potential of ashwaganda, sutherlandia and elderberry on tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced chemokine (CCL2 and CCL5) expression in vitro. RESULTS: Elderberry water-soluble extract (WSE) was pro-inflammatory, while sutherlandia WSE only partially attenuated the TNF-α-induced changes in CCL5. However, ashwaganda WSE completely prevented TNF-α-induced increases in CCL5, while attenuating the increase in CCL2 expression and NF-κB activation. The same pattern of ashwagandha protection was seen using LPS as the pro-inflammatory stimuli. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results demonstrate the ashwaganda WSE as a valid candidate for evaluation of therapeutic potential for the treatment of chronic renal dysfunction.",

Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is a herb known to improve the body's physical and psychological condition. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy and safety of a high-concentration ashwagandha root extract (HCARE) supplementation for improving sexual function in healthy females. METHODS: In this pilot study, 50 study subjects were randomized to either (i) HCARE-treated group or (ii) placebo- (starch-) treated group. The subjects consumed either HCARE or placebo capsules of 300mg twice daily for 8 weeks. Sexual function was assessed using two psychometric scales, the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) Questionnaire and the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS), and by the number of total and successful sexual encounters. RESULTS: The analysis indicates that treatment with HCARE leads to significantly higher improvement, relative to placebo, in the FSFI Total score (p < 0.001), FSFI domain score for \"arousal\" (p < 0.001), \"lubrication\" (p < 0.001), \"orgasm\" (p = 0.004), and \"satisfaction\" (p < 0.001), and also FSDS score (p < 0.001) and the number of successful sexual encounters (p < 0.001) at the end of the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that oral administration of HCARE may improve sexual function in healthy women.

      "abstract": "Rapidly increasing aging population and environmental stressors are the two main global concerns of the modern society. These have brought in light rapidly increasing incidence of a variety of pathological conditions including brain tumors, neurodegenerative & neuropsychiatric disorders, and new challenges for their treatment. The overlapping symptoms, complex etiology and lack of full understanding of the brain structure and function to-date further complicate these tasks. On the other hand, several herbal reagents with a long history of their use have been asserted to possess neurodifferentiation, neuroregenerative and neuroprotective potentials, and hence been recommended as supplement to enhance and maintain brain health and function. Although they have been claimed to function by holistic approach resulting in maintaining body homeostasis and brain health, there are not enough laboratory studies in support to these and mechanism(s) of such beneficial activities remain largely undefined. One such herb is Ashwagandha, also called \"Queen of Ayurveda\" for its popular use in Indian traditional home medicine because of its extensive benefits including anticancer, anti-stress and remedial potential for aging and neurodegenerative pathologies. However, active principles and underlying mechanism(s) of action remain largely unknown. Here we provide a review on the effects of Ashwagandha extracts and active principles, and underlying molecular mechanism(s) for brain pathologies. We highlight our findings on the nootropic potential of Ashwagandha leaves. The effects of Ashwagandha leaf extracts are multidimensional ranging from differentiation of neuroblastoma and glioma cells, reversal of Alzheimer and Parkinson's pathologies, protection against environmental neurotoxins and enhancement of memory.",

METHODS: We investigated the effects of MEAG on programmed cell death in HNSCC cells using a Live/Dead assay, detection of nuclear morphologic changes, Mitotracker, siRNA knockdown, and RT-PCR. RESULTS: Treatment with MEAG showed dose-dependent growth-inhibitory activity that attribute to caspase-dependent apoptosis. Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase 9 suggested that MEAG leads to activation of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. MEAG selectively upregulated the expression of Bim protein at the transcriptional level and induced the translocation of Bim into the mitochondria. Knockdown of Bim by siRNA partially blocked MEAG-mediated apoptosis. MEAG also caused an increase in truncated Bid (t-Bid), cleaved caspase-8, and death receptor 5 (DR5). Interestingly, withaferin A (WA), a bioactive component of MEAG, clearly induced apoptosis accompanied by upregulation of Bim, t-Bid, caspase-8, and DR5 similar to the effects of MEAG. CONCLUSIONS: These suggest that MEAG and WA may be potential natural materials for the treatment of HNSCC.",

However, safety and efficacy of this treatment have not been evaluated. Therefore, the present study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ayurvedic treatment (Ashwagandha powder and Sidh Makardhwaj) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: One hundred and twenty five patients with joint pain were screened at an Ayurvedic hospital in New Delhi, India. Eighty six patients satisfied inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Detailed medical history and physical examination were recorded. Patients took 5g of Ashwagandha powder twice a day for three weeks with lukewarm water or milk. Sidh Makardhwaj (100 mg) with honey was administered daily for the next four weeks. The follow up of patients was carried out every two weeks. The primary efficacy end point was based on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response. Secondary end points were ACR50, ACR70 responses, change from baseline in disease activity score (DAS) 28 score and ACR parameters. Safety assessments were hepatic function [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin and ß2 microglobulin], renal function (urea and creatinine and NGAL) tests and urine mercury level. RESULTS: The study was completed by 90.7 per cent (78/86) patients. Patients with moderate and high disease activity were 57.7 per cent (45/78) and 42.3 per cent (33/78), respectively. All patients were tested positive for rheumatoid factor and increased ESR level. Ashwagandha and Sidh Makardhwaj treatment decreased RA factor. A significant change in post-treatment scores of tender joint counts, swollen joint counts, physician global assessment score, patient global assessment score, pain assessment score, patient self assessed disability index score and ESR level were observed as compared to baseline scores. ACR20 response was observed in 56.4 per cent (44/78) patients (American College of Rheumatology criteria) and moderate response in 39.74 per cent (31/78) patients [European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria]. Ayurvedic treatment for seven weeks in rheumatoid arthritis patients showed normal kidney and liver function tests. However, increased urinary mercury levels were was observed after treatment. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study suggest that this Ayurvedic treatment (Ashwagandha powder and Sidh Makardhwaj) has a potential to be used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. However, due to small sample size, short duration, non randomization and lack of a control group as study limitations, further studies need to be done to confirm these findings.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory autoimmune disorder. Withania somnifera Dunal (Solanaceae) (WS), is a common medicinal plant used in traditional systems of medicine for the treatment of arthritis, and is an ingredient of anti-arthritic polyherbal formulations such as Habb-e-Asgand® and Arthritin™. In the present study, we evaluated the antioxidant and anti-arthritic activity of aqueous extract of WS root (WSAq) in collagen-induced arthritic (CIA) rats. METHODS: CIA rats were treated by using three doses of WSAq (100, 200, 300 mg/kg b. wt., orally) and methotrexate (MTX, 0.25 mg/kg b. wt. i.p.) as a standard reference drug for 20 days. The anti-arthritic effect was assayed by measuring the arthritic index, autoantibodies such as rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (a-CCP), anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-collagen type II antibody (a-CII) and inflammatory marker like C-reactive protein (CRP). The oxidative stress parameters were also measured. RESULTS: Treatment with WSAq resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in arthritic index, autoantibodies and CRP (p < 0.05) with maximum effect at dose of 300 mg/kg b. wt. and the results were comparable to that of MTX-treated rats. Similarly, oxidative stress in CIA rats was ameliorated by treatment with different doses of WSAq, as evidenced by a decrease in lipid peroxidation and glutathione-S-transferase activity and an increase in the glutathione content and ferric-reducing ability of plasma (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that WSAq exhibited antioxidant and anti-arthritic activity and reduced inflammation in CIA rats and suggests the potential use of this plant in the treatment of arthritis.",

With a hypothesis that the i-Extract induced expression of Arc protein may cause augmentation in Arc function, we examined the effect of i-extract on a major function of Arc protein, i.e. F-actin expansion, using Arc antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). Stereotaxic infusion of Arc antisense ODN in the CA1 region of hippocampus decreased the level of Arc protein as demonstrated by immunoblotting. However, this decrease was attenuated when treated with i-Extract prior to infusion of Arc antisense ODN. We noted a significant decrease in the polymerization of F-actin during scopolamine-induced amnesia as well as Arc antisense ODN infusion that was restored rather enhanced when pre-treated with i-Extract in both the cases. We also compared the corresponding changes between CA1 (the infusion site) and CA3 (neighbouring site of infusion) regions of hippocampus, and found more pronounced effects in CA1 than in the CA3 region. The extent of F-actin polymerization, as revealed by changes in the dendritic spine architecture through Golgi staining, showed that both scopolamine as well as Arc antisense ODN disrupted the spine density and mushroom-shaped morphology that was again regained if pre-treated with i-Extract. In conclusion, the findings reveal that the Arc helps in polymerization of F-actin and subsequent changes in the morphology of dendritic spines after pre-treatment with i-Extract in scopolamine-induced amnesic mice, suggesting an important role of Arc in scopolamine-induced amnesia and its recovery by i-Extract.",

DESIGN: Systematic review of the literature, with searches conducted in PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL, and Google Scholar by a medical librarian. Additionally, the reference lists of studies identified in these databases were searched by a research assistant, and queries were conducted in the AYUSH Research Portal. Search terms included \"ashwagandha,\" \"Withania somnifera,\" and terms related to anxiety and stress. Inclusion criteria were human randomized controlled trials with a treatment arm that included WS as a remedy for anxiety or stress. The study team members applied inclusion criteria while screening the records by abstract review. INTERVENTION: Treatment with any regimen of WS. OUTCOME MEASURES: Number and results of studies identified in the review. RESULTS: Sixty-two abstracts were screened; five human trials met inclusion criteria. Three studies compared several dosage levels of WS extract with placebos using versions of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, with two demonstrating significant benefit of WS versus placebo, and the third demonstrating beneficial effects that approached but did not achieve significance (p=0.05). A fourth study compared naturopathic care with WS versus psychotherapy by using Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scores as an outcome; BAI scores decreased by 56.5% in the WS group and decreased 30.5% for psychotherapy (p<0.0001). A fifth study measured changes in Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores in WS group versus placebo; there was a 44.0% reduction in PSS scores in the WS group and a 5.5% reduction in the placebo group (p<0.0001). All studies exhibited unclear or high risk of bias, and heterogenous design and reporting prevented the possibility of meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: All five studies concluded that WS intervention resulted in greater score improvements (significantly in most cases) than placebo in outcomes on anxiety or stress scales. Current evidence should be received with caution because of an assortment of study methods and cases of potential bias.",

      "abstract": "Bisphenol A (BPA) safety aspects on human health are debated extensively for long time. In the present study, we have studied the toxicity induced by BPA at no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) using HepG2 cells. We report that BPA at 100 nM induced cytotoxicity to HepG2 cells as determined by MTT assay at 0-72 h. The toxicity was result of reduced oxygen consumption and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential associated with decreased ATP production. The BPA treatment resulted in increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) content with decreased glutathione and other antioxidant enzymes. BPA derived toxicity is a concern to human health and alternative non-toxic natural products/derivatives or adjuvants that serve as antidote will be relevant. In this context, Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) a widely used herb to treat arthritis, rheumatism and to improve longevity for time immemorial is investigated for its antidote effect. Ashwagandha supercritical CO2 extract derived Withanolides (ADW) at 100 μg/ml protect HepG2 cells from BPA induced toxicity by suppressing mitochondrial damage and increased ATP production. Further, cellular MDA content was significantly suppressed with increased non-enzymic and antioxidant enzyme activities. These findings derived from the present study suggest the beneficial effect of ADW in mitigating BPA induced mitochondrial toxicity in HepG2 cells."

      "abstract": "Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) has been described in traditional Indian Ayurvedic medicine as an aphrodisiac that can be used to treat male sexual dysfunction and infertility. This pilot study was conducted to evaluate the spermatogenic activity of Ashwagandha root extract in oligospermic patients. Forty-six male patients with oligospermia (sperm count < 20 million/mL semen) were enrolled and randomized either to treatment (n = 21) with a full-spectrum root extract of Ashwagandha (675 mg/d in three doses for 90 days) or to placebo (n = 25) in the same protocol. Semen parameters and serum hormone levels were estimated at the end of 90-day treatment. There was a 167% increase in sperm count (9.59 ± 4.37 × 10(6)/mL to 25.61 ± 8.6 × 10(6)/mL; P < 0.0001), 53% increase in semen volume (1.74 ± 0.58 mL to 2.76 ± 0.60 mL; P < 0.0001), and 57% increase in sperm motility (18.62 ± 6.11% to 29.19 ± 6.31%; P < 0.0001) on day 90 from baseline. The improvement in these parameters was minimal in the placebo-treated group. Furthermore, a significantly greater improvement and regulation were observed in serum hormone levels with the Ashwagandha treatment as compared to the placebo. The present study adds to the evidence on the therapeutic value of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), as attributed in Ayurveda for the treatment of oligospermia leading to infertility."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive dysfunction of memory and higher cognitive functions with abnormal accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles throughout cortical and limbic brain regions. At present no curative treatment is available, and research focuses on drugs for slowing disease progression or providing prophylaxis. Withania somnifera (WS) also known as 'ashwagandha' is used widely in Ayurvedic medicine as a nerve tonic and memory enhancer. However, there is a paucity of data on the potential neuroprotective effects of W.somnifera against β-Amyloid (1-42)-induced neuropathogenesis. In the present study, we have tested the neuroprotective effects of methanol:Chloroform (3:1) extract of ashwagandha against β-amyloid induced toxicity and HIV-1Ba-L (clade B) infection using a human neuronal SK-N-MC cell line. Our results showed that β-amyloid induced cytotoxic effects in SK-N-MC cells as shown by decreased cell growth when tested individually. Also, confocal microscopic analysis showed decreased spine density, loss of spines and decreased dendrite diameter, total dendrite and spine area in clade B infected SK-N-MC cells compared to uninfected cells. However, when ashwagandha was added to β-amyloid treated and HIV-1 infected samples, the toxic effects were neutralized. Further, the MTT cell viability assays and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) levels supported these observations indicating the neuroprotective effect of WS root extract against β-amyloid and HIV-1Ba-L (clade B) induced neuro-pathogenesis.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer is a leading cause of death accounting for 15-20% of global mortality. Although advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic technologies have improved cancer survival statistics, 75% of the world population live in underdeveloped regions and have poor access to the advanced medical remedies. Natural therapies hence become an alternative choice of treatment. Ashwagandha, a tropical herb used in Indian Ayurvedic medicine, has a long history of its health promoting and therapeutic effects. In the present study, we have investigated an anticancer activity in the water extract of Ashwagandha leaves (ASH-WEX). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Anticancer activity in the water extract of Ashwagandha leaves (ASH-WEX) was detected by in vitro and in vivo assays. Bioactivity-based size fractionation and NMR analysis were performed to identify the active anticancer component(s). Mechanism of anticancer activity in the extract and its purified component was investigated by biochemical assays. We report that the ASH-WEX is cytotoxic to cancer cells selectively, and causes tumor suppression in vivo. Its active anticancer component was identified as triethylene glycol (TEG). Molecular analysis revealed activation of tumor suppressor proteins p53 and pRB by ASH-WEX and TEG in cancer cells. In contrast to the hypophosphorylation of pRB, decrease in cyclin B1 and increase in cyclin D1 in ASH-WEX and TEG-treated cancer cells (undergoing growth arrest), normal cells showed increase in pRB phosphorylation and cyclin B1, and decrease in cyclin D1 (signifying their cell cycle progression). We also found that the MMP-3 and MMP-9 that regulate metastasis were down regulated in ASH-WEX and TEG-treated cancer cells; normal cells remained unaffected. CONCLUSION: We provide the first molecular evidence that the ASH-WEX and TEG have selective cancer cell growth arrest activity and hence may offer natural and economic resources for anticancer medicine.",

      "abstract": "Arc (Activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein) is a member of the immediate-early gene (IEG) family protein. Because of its critical role in learning and memory, it is widely considered to be an important protein in synaptic plasticity and related neurobiological functions. Alcoholic extract of Ashwagandha leaves (i-Extract) was recently shown to have preventive and therapeutic potential for scopolamine-induced amnesia and glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of Arc in scopolamine-induced amnesia and its recovery by i-Extract with particular focus to the changes in Arc expression in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of mice. Morris water maze test showed that spatial learning and memory of mice were drastically reduced by scopolamine administration but improved with i-Extract treatment as compared to control and scopolamine-challenged mice. Molecular analysis revealed a remarkable decline in Arc expression in both hippocampus and cerebral cortex of amnesic mice, which was recovered after i-Extract treatment. Interestingly, Arc expression showed better recovery in the hippocampus than the cerebral cortex and the pre-treatment with i-Extract was more effective than the post-treatment. These findings suggest that Arc may be involved in i-Extract mediated recovery from amnesia.",
