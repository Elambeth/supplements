      "abstract": "Spotty liver disease (SLD) caused by Campylobacter hepaticus has emerged as an important cause of disease in table egg layers in the United States. The disease associated with C. hepaticus results in focal lesions on the livers of infected birds, reduced egg production, and increased mortality of layer hens. Currently, there are no approved treatments and no commercial vaccine available for C. hepaticus, and very limited research is available supporting best approaches for the control of C. hepaticus in organic or antibiotic free-laying hens. We assessed the potential effects of water acidification treatments for the control of C. hepaticus in challenged specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens and transmission of the organism to naïve birds. The objective of this study was to develop a challenge and treatment model to assess the effects of oregano, apple cider vinegar, and citric acid as potential control measures for C. hepaticus in challenged birds. We divided 148 SPF chickens, 17 wk of age, into five groups; four groups (with 51% of the birds in each group orally challenged with C. hepaticus) and one negative control group (n = 8). A dose of 107 cfu/ml of C. hepaticus was given on day 1, day 4, and day 7 by oral gavage. At day 10 after the day 1 challenge, three challenged groups were treated for 5 days with either oregano, apple cider vinegar, or citric acid in the water. One challenged but not treated group and the negative control received only water as treatment. Bile and liver samples from challenged and nonchallenged naïve exposed birds were collected from euthanatized birds at days 9, 15, 20, and 27 after the first day challenge to evaluate the presence of C. hepaticus gross lesions and detection via culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmation. Results showed that challenged birds were able to develop mild to moderate multifocal liver lesions resembling SLD. Severe lesions were evident in the naïve, exposed nonchallenged birds. Positive bacterial culture and colony PCR positives were found in challenged birds in each challenge group. Results from PCR of DNA extracted from liver samples were able to detect a greater number of C. hepaticus-positive samples than culture PCR of bile alone. Treatment with oregano, apple cider vinegar, or citric acid was not able to clear C. hepaticus from challenged birds because more than 44% of the challenged birds remained positive on liver PCR analysis posttreatment. Results also found that C. hepaticus could be passed horizontally because more than 29% of the naïve nonchallenged birds became C. hepaticus positive postintroduction to challenged birds. Overall, this study found that this challenge model for C. hepaticus was successful and that treatments did not clear C. hepaticus in challenged birds. Nevertheless, it appears that acidifying the water could help to reduce C. hepaticus load in naïve birds because in groups treated with oregano, apple cider vinegar, or citric acid C. hepaticus could not be cultured from bile.",

Forty-five primary incisors in thirty children. The treatment was performed under local anesthesia with rubber dam isolation. Sterile paper points were inserted for 60 s to collect the first bacterial swab (S1). Root canal walls were prepared and irrigated with 22 mL within 5 min according to the following groups (randomly with 1:1:1 allocation ratio): Group A: (n = 15) with 5% PPE, Group B: (n = 15) with 5% ACV, and Group C: (n = 15) with 5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). Canals were dried with paper points, and paper point was placed in each canal for 60 s to collect the second bacterial swab (S2). Bacterial colonies were counted after 48-hour incubation at 37 °C and the bacterial counts in the S1 and S2 for each sample were compared using the decimal logarithm. Intra-group comparisons were made using Paired sample t and Wilcoxon signed ranks tests. Between-groups comparisons were made using One-Way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, and Independent Samples tests. The significance level was set at α = 0.05. PPE demonstrated a 60.43% reduction in CFU count, ACV demonstrated a 51.56% reduction in CFU count, while NaOCl showed an 87.49% reduction in CFU count. Although NaOCl has shown effectiveness in reducing bacterial counts, PPE and ACV have also displayed some antibacterial activity. However, their overall efficacy is less established, which raises questions about their viability as a natural alternative to a 5% NaOCl.",

      "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) constitutes a significant health concern because it promotes infectious mastitis in dairy animals and poses a hazard risk to humans. Controlling MRSA infections is a growing challenge on a global scale because of the bacteria's toxicity and its capacity to develop multidrug resistance (MDR). Combating against MDR bacteria and the spread of infectious diseases needs natural antibacterial alternatives to minimize the economic losses of mastitis. The average treatment cost in Egypt was highlighted. The antibacterial effect of apple cider vinegar (ACV) against MDR-MRSA isolates was evaluated, also the study aimed at profiling antimicrobial resistance genes in MRSA isolates. The incidence of mastitis in cows was more than in buffaloes, and the average total treatment cost was estimated at 82 million EGP from 2016 to 2021 (around 14 million EGP annually). Of the 22 S. aureus isolates (20 %), of which (59.1 % were from cows and 40.9 % from buffaloes), 19 (86.4 %) were confirmed as MRSA. All MRSA isolates exhibited resistance to clindamycin (94.7 %), then both ampicillin and doxycycline (84.2 %), and ampicillin and sulbactam, erythromycin and Fosfomycin (each, 78.9 %). Vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin can be used to treat MRSA. The prevalence of MDR was significantly high, with 94.7 % of the cases having multiple antimicrobial resistance (MAR) indices ranging from 0.25 to 0.75. All MRSA isolates tested positive for mecA, 89.5 % for the blaZ gene, 84.2 % for tetM, and 73.4 % for ermB. In vitro, the antibacterial properties of ACV were demonstrated to be superior by our results which demonstrate a zone of inhibition with diameters ranging from 20 to 40 mm detected by Agar well diffusion technique and MIC's (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration) ranging from 2 to 4 μg/ml. Some isolates possess MBC (Minimal Bactericidal Concentration) values at the same MIC. This research proposes the potential of ACV to act as a promising antibacterial alternative against MRSA. This can help minimize the health problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and improve the efficiency of dairy farms. Further studies are recommended to determine the proper dosage for field administration.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The primary cause of memory loss is Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have shown that natural compounds like apple cider vinegar (ACV) have anti-Alzheimer's capabilities. Essential components of ACV, such as gallic acid and chlorogenic acid, may be in charge of the drug's pharmacological effects. METHODS: Using molecular docking and dynamics (MD), the current work looks at the aspect of ACV that protects against AD. To study the conformational relationships and interaction mechanisms between two biological molecules (such as interactions between proteins and drugs or between proteins), MD simulation is frequently used. MD can help understand molecular structural differences between proteins and small compounds. We used acetylcholinesterase (AChE, PDB ID: 1UT6) to MD chlorogenic and gallic acids, as well as the currently prescribed medication rivastigmine (Standard medication). Furthermore, we determine the binding affinity, which may be responsible for AChE inhibition. MD simulations were performed on docked complexes of chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, and rivastigmine with receptor 1UT6 for a 300 ns trajectory to ensure the stability of docked ligand-protein complexes. RESULTS: The results showed that chlorogenic acid has the highest binding affinity and stability for AChE inhibition. In the docking and dynamics analysis, both techniques have predicted chlorogenic acid to be a potential constituent of ACV which shows a similar activity when compared to rivastigmine by virtue of binding affinity. CONCLUSION: These findings identify chlorogenic acid as the key component of ACV that protects against AD-related cognitive and behavioral impairments. This finding will be critical in the development of ACV-based drugs for Alzheimer's disease treatment.",

One such remedy that has gained popularity is apple cider vinegar (ACV). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of ACV consumption on weight, blood glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol levels in a sample of the Lebanese population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 120 overweight and obese individuals were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group receiving 5, 10 or 15 mL of ACV or a control group receiving a placebo (group 4) over a 12-week period. Measurements of anthropometric parameters, fasting blood glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol levels were taken at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12. RESULTS: Our findings showed that daily consumption of the three doses of ACV for a duration of between 4 and 12 weeks is associated with significant reductions in anthropometric variables (weight, body mass index, waist/hip circumferences and body fat ratio), blood glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol levels. No significant risk factors were observed during the 12 weeks of ACV intake. CONCLUSION: Consumption of ACV in people with overweight and obesity led to an improvement in the anthropometric and metabolic parameters. ACV could be a promising antiobesity supplement that does not produce any side effects."

On the 22nd day, PCOS-induced animals were segregated into 4 groups and administered with CMC, ACV, metformin, and a combination of ACV and metformin, respectively. The treatments were continued for 15 days, and on the 36th day, all the animals were sacrificed for biochemical (blood glucose, lipid profile), hormonal (sex hormones and adiponectin), and pro-inflammatory mediator estimations in blood samples. The ovarian tissue samples were used for oxidative stress parameters and histological alterations. The PCOS control animals showed a significant alteration in the estrous cycle. The administration of letrozole resulted in the alteration of hormonal balance and elevation of body weights, glycemic state, lipid profile, pro-inflammatory mediators in serum, and oxidative stress in ovarian samples. Individual treatment groups and combination treatment groups reversed the letrozole-induced alterations in PCOS animals, and more promising results were observed with combination therapy than with individual treatment groups. Further, the therapeutic potential of the combination treatment group was also confirmed by the histological observations in the ovarian samples. The study showed that the combination of ACV and metformin significantly alleviated letrozole-induced PCOS complications in rats. This might have been achieved by mitigating the hormonal imbalance, pro-inflammatory, hyperglycemic, and hyperlipidemic states in serum, and oxidative stress in the ovary samples.",

      "abstract": "AIMS AND BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the antimicrobial activities of commercially available 5% apple cider vinegar (ACV) against Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, and Lactobacillus casei. Materials and methods: Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were conducted using the broth microdilution method. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) of 5.25% was used as a positive control, and comparisons were also made with acetic acid (AA) as the main ingredient in ACV. The three test bacteria treated with the most effective ACV dilution were visualized under a transmission electron microscope (TEM) for structural changes. RESULTS: Minimal inhibitory concentration was determined at 0.625% of the concentration of ACV against S. mutans and E. faecalis and 1.25% of the concentration of ACV against L. casei with two-fold serial dilutions. A concentration of 5 × 10-1% with 10-fold serial dilutions was found to be the MIC value for all three bacteria. No significant differences were found when compared with the positive control (NaOCl) (p = 0.182, p = 0.171, and p = 0.234), respectively, for two-fold serial dilutions and (p = 1.000, p = 0.658, and p = 0.110), respectively for 10-fold serial dilutions. MBC was observed to be 5% ACV for both E. faecalis and S. mutans. However, positive microbial growth was observed on the agar plate when cultured with L. casei. An independent sample t-test showed no significant differences (p > 0.05) in the antimicrobial activities between 5% ACV and 5% pure AA. TEM revealed cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane disruptions on all three bacteria at MIC value. CONCLUSION: Apple cider vinegar has antimicrobial activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, and Lactobacillus casei at their respective MIC values. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Apple cider vinegar can be an alternative antimicrobial dental pulp disinfectant to sodium hypochlorite. Apple cider vinegar can be used safely, especially in children's dental pulp therapy and deep caries management, when adequate tooth isolation is not readily achievable. Thus, adverse reactions commonly associated with other frequently used chemical disinfectants can be avoided.",

METHODS: This study was a randomized clinical trial and the participants were adults with type 2 diabetes. Participants were divided into two groups: ACV and control. The ACV group was treated with 30 ml of ACV per day. Both the intervention and control groups received the same recommendation for a healthy diet. Before and after eight weeks, fasting blood glucose, insulin, hemoglobin A1C, insulin resistance, total cholesterol (Chol), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglyceride were measured. RESULTS: Fasting blood glucose decreased after intervention in both groups, which was only significant in the ACV group (p = 0.01). There was a significant difference in hemoglobin A1C levels between the two groups (p < 0.001) after eight weeks. LDL was decreased in the ACV group (p < 0.001). Total Chol, LDL/HDL and Chol/HDL ratio decreased after the intervention period in the ACV group compared to the control group (p = 0.003, p = 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Daily consumption of ACV may have beneficial effects in controlling blood glucose indices and lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes.

The objective was to study available, natural, and inexpensive ways to improve oral health status among the studied group. Materials and methods A randomized clinical trial was performed on 50 children with cerebral palsy aged from three to six years. Participants were divided into two groups (n=25, apple cider vinegar, manual brushing without toothpaste). Plaque accumulation and gingival status were evaluated using Turesky of the Quigley-Hein plaque index (TQHPI) and modified gingival index (MGI) seven times: pre-intervention baseline (T0), post-intervention at one month (T1), two months (T2), three months (T3), four months (T4), five months (T5), six months (T6). Results Plaque accumulation and gingivitis decreased significantly for the ACV group between T0 and T6 (p<0.05) and demonstrated significantly lower plaque accumulation and gingivitis compared to the manual brushing group (p<0.05) at T5 and T6. The manual brushing group showed decreasing in TQHPI between T0 and T3, then TQHPI increased significantly (p<0.05) at T4, T5, and T6. Conclusions To sum up, this in vitro study has demonstrated the possibility of using apple cider vinegar to reduce plaque and gingivitis. In addition, without additives, apple cider vinegar has both mechanical and chemical effects on dental plaque, and it may be a natural, available, inexpensive, and harmless substance that can improve the quality of oral care for difficult groups of children and people with special needs. Unlike toothbrushes, especially electric toothbrushes, they are effective, but they may be expensive and not available to all children."

      "abstract": "This study evaluated the effect of apple cider vinegar (ACV) on the carcass characteristics and meat quality of broiler chickens. A total of 300 broilers (Arbor Acre) were randomized to six treatments replicated 5 times (50 birds/treatment and 10 birds/replicate) from 2 days old till the sixth week of age in a 2 by 3 factorial layout consisting of dosages (5.0 mL/L and 10.0 mL/L ACV) and administration frequency (antibiotics following standard schedule, twice/week ACV and thrice/week ACV). At the sixth week, sixty birds (10 birds/treatment) were selected for carcass yield, cut part yield, organ weight, meat technological properties, lipid profiles, and malondialdehyde (MDA) level evaluation. Data obtained were subjected to two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test at a P < 0.05 significant level. Birds administered 5.0 mL/L ACV thrice weekly presented a significantly (P < 0.05) higher plucked, eviscerated, dressed, thigh and breast weight compared with the other treatments. The spleen of birds in the control group was significantly (P < 0.05) heavier than those administered ACV. The meat from the 5.0 mL/L ACV group had significantly higher (P < 0.05) water absorptive power and lower refrigeration loss, as depicted in the main effect table. Meat cholesterol, phospholipids, and MDA levels did not differ across the treatments except triglyceride, which was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the 5.0 mL/L ACV thrice-weekly group. This study concludes that ACV administration could improve carcass yield and meat quality indices. Thus, its use as an alternative to conventional antibiotics for broiler chickens might be beneficial.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Monoamine Oxidase (MAO), which catalyzes the oxidative deamination of amines present in the brain and peripheral tissues, is involved in the metabolism of monoamines and is vital for cognition. This study was designed to examine the protective effect of Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) on MAO and amine neurotransmitters such as dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), non-adrenaline (NA) levels. METHOD: In this experiment, out of five groups, three groups of animals were pretreated with one of the test drugs each i.e., Chrysin (10 mg/kg), ACV (0.7% v/v) and Rivastigmine (2.5 mg/kg) along with Zn with high fat diet (HFD) for 3 months and the rest two groups were that of control and disease induced. After the treatment period, mice were examined for MAO-A & B, DA, 5-HT and NA level estimation. RESULTS: The results showed that Zn with HFD had induced a significant increase (p < 0.01, p < 0.001) in MAO-A & B levels and a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in the levels of 5-HT, DA, and NA. Pretreatment of test drugs with Zn with HFD caused a restoration activity and a significant decrease (p < 0.01, p < 0.05) in MAO-A & B levels and a significant increase (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.001) in the level of DA, 5HT and NA as compared to the Zn treated group. Amongst all three test drugs mentioned above, the ACV-treated group showed the most improvement during pretreatment. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that ACV, might prove to be a beneficial nutraceutical & provide a protective effect against Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neurological diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Elevated lipid profiles and impaired glucose homeostasis are risk factors for several cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which, subsequently, represent a leading cause of early mortality, worldwide. The aim of the current study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of apple cider vinegar (ACV) on lipid profiles and glycemic parameters in adults. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in electronic databases, including Medline, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Web of Knowledge, from database inception to January 2020. All clinical trials which investigated the effect of ACV on lipid profiles and glycemic indicators were included. Studies were excluded if ACV was used in combination with other interventions or when the duration of intervention was < 2 weeks. To account for between-study heterogeneity, we performed meta-analysis using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Overall, nine studies, including 10 study arms, were included in this meta-analysis. We found that ACV consumption significantly decreased serum total cholesterol (- 6.06 mg/dL; 95% CI: - 10.95, - 1.17; I2: 39%), fasting plasma glucose (- 7.97 mg/dL; 95% CI: - 13.74, - 2.21; I2: 75%), and HbA1C concentrations (- 0.50; 95% CI: - 0.90, - 0.09; I2: 91%). No significant effect of ACV consumption was found on serum LDL-C, HDL-C, fasting insulin concentrations, or HOMA-IR. The stratified analysis revealed a significant reduction of serum TC and TG in a subgroup of patients with type 2 diabetes, those who took ≤15 mL/day of ACV, and those who consumed ACV for > 8-weeks, respectively. Furthermore, ACV consumption significantly decreased FPG levels in a subgroup of studies that administered ACV for > 8-weeks. Further, ACV intake appeared to elicit an increase in FPG and HDL-C concentrations in apparently healthy participants. CONCLUSION: We found a significant favorable effect of ACV consumption on FPG and blood lipid levels.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress is the critical marker of neurological complications such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is known to have health benefits due to its antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and high antioxidant properties. Therefore, we hypothesized that regular consumption of ACV would protect against AD-like neurological diseases via inhibition of oxidative stress. Authors have compared the efficacy of ACV with that of Chrysin and Rivastigmine in cellular and animal studies. In the cellular study, oxidative stress was induced in Neuro2A cells (1 × 107 ) via H2 O2 (50 μM) treatment. Subsequently, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was performed, and cell viability, SOD, GSH, lipid peroxidation (MDA) levels were measured. Similarly, in the animal study, oxidative stress was introduced in Swiss albino mice (10-11 weeks old, 20-25 g, n = 30) via scopolamine (1 mg/kg). Subsequently, histopathological experiments were performed; cognitive ability, AChE activity, and SOD, GSH, and MDA levels were measured. The in vitro results indicated that ACV (2 μM) provided better protection than Chrysin and Rivstigmine in cell viability. ACV has also performed better in restoring the antioxidants markers (SOD, GSH levels) and reducing MDA and AChE levels. In the in vivo study, test compounds (ACV, Chrysin, and Rivastigmine) improved cognitive impairment, increased the SOD and GSH level, reduced the MDA level and AChE activity, and protected the cortex-hippocampal neurons from degeneration. Here also, ACV (0.7%) showed better neuroprotection than the other two compounds. Therefore, these results supported our hypothesis that moderate consumption of ACV might prove to be beneficial prophylaxis against AD-like neurological diseases.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Atopic dermatitis is a common skin disease characterized by altered cutaneous immunity in which patients often exhibit lower skin microbiota diversity compared to healthy skin and are prone to colonization by Staphylococcus aureus. Apple cider vinegar has been shown to have antibacterial effects; however, its effects on the skin microbiome have not previously been well-described. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the effects of topical dilute apple cider vinegar soaks on Staphylococcus aureus abundance, skin bacterial microbiome composition, and skin bacterial microbiome diversity in atopic dermatitis participants compared to healthy skin. METHODS: Eleven subjects with atopic dermatitis and 11 healthy controls were enrolled in this randomized, non-blinded, single-institution, split-arm pilot study. Subjects soaked one forearm in dilute apple cider vinegar (0.5% acetic acid) and the other forearm in tap water for 10 minutes daily. Skin bacteria samples were collected from subjects' volar forearms before and after 14 days of treatment. 16S sequencing was used to analyze Staphylococcus aureus abundance and skin bacterial microbiome composition, and alpha diversity of microbiota were determined using Shannon diversity index. RESULTS: There was no difference in skin bacterial microbiome in atopic dermatitis subjects after 2 weeks of daily water or apple cider vinegar treatments (p = 0.056 and p = 0.22, respectively), or in mean abundance of S. aureus on apple cider vinegar-treated forearms (p = 0.60). At 2 weeks, the skin bacterial microbiomes of healthy control subjects were not significantly different from the skin bacterial microbiome of atopic dermatitis subjects (p = 0.14, 0.21, 0.12, and 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that daily soaks in 0.5% apple cider vinegar are not an effective method of altering the skin bacterial microbiome in atopic dermatitis. Further studies are needed to explore the effects of different concentrations of apple cider vinegar on skin microflora and disease severity. TRIAL NUMBER: UVA IRB-HSR #19906.",

Further they are associated with high morbidity and mortality from treatment failure. Therapy involves multiple rounds of ineffective antibiotics alongside unwanted side effects, alternative treatments are crucial. Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is a natural, vegan product that has been shown to have powerful antimicrobial activity hence we investigated whether ACV could ameliorate these resistant bacteria. The minimum dilution of ACV required for growth inhibition was comparable for both bacteria (1/25 dilution of ACV liquid and ACV tablets at 200 µg/ml were effective against rE. coli and MRSA). Monocyte co-culture with microbes alongside ACV resulted in an increase in monocyte phagocytosis by 21.2% and 33.5% compared to non-ACV treated but MRSA or rE. coli stimulated monocytes, respectively. Label free quantitative proteomic studies of microbial protein extracts demonstrated that ACV penetrated microbial cell membranes and organelles, altering the expression of key proteins. This resulted in significant reductions in total protein expression, moreover we could only detect ribosomal proteins; 50 s 30 s, enolase, phosphenol pyruvate and the ATP synthase subunit in rE. coli. Elongation factor iNOS and phosphoglycerate kinase OS were the only proteins present in MRSA samples following ACV treatment.",

It is on this background the present study assessed its protective effects against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced oxidative damage in kidneys of rats. METHODS: Twenty four adult rats of Wistar strain were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 6). While group I animals served as control; kidney oxidative damage was induced in groups II and III animals using a single intraperitoneal injection of CCl4 (100%, 1.73 mL/kg body weight, BW). Group II animals were left untreated and groups III and IV counterparts were administered APCV (1.56 mL/kg BW) once daily for a period of 7 days. Thereafter, the animals were fasted over night, and sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and samples (blood and kidney tissues) were collected for biochemical/histopathological examinations. Kidney function markers including urea, creatinine, sodium ion (Na+) and potassium ion (k+) were determined in the serum while thin sections of kidneys were processed for histopathological screening. RESULTS: Compared to the control animals, CCl4 administration caused kidney damage as evidenced by significant (P < 0.05) increase in the evaluated indices (urea, creatinine, Na+ and K+). Interestingly, treatment of CCl4-exposed rats with APCV markedly reversed the above alterations to near normal. Besides, APCV treatment ameliorated the histological derangements (hemorrhagic lesions) caused by CCl4 in the kidney of the experimental rats. CONCLUSION: These observations apparently suggest that Apple cider vinegar has the therapeutic potential to protect against renal impairment and attendant malfunction."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin condition associated with high transepidermal water loss, high skin pH, and Staphylococcus aureus skin colonization. The treatment of AD with bath additives remains highly debated. Recent evidence suggests that dilute apple cider vinegar (ACV) may improve skin barrier integrity in AD, but its safety and efficacy are not well studied. This pilot split-arm study analyzed the effect of dilute apple cider vinegar soaks on skin barrier integrity in patients with atopic dermatitis as measured by skin transepidermal water loss and skin pH. METHODS: A total of 22 subjects (11 AD and 11 healthy controls) were enrolled. Subjects soaked both of their forearms for 14 days, with one arm in dilute ACV (0.5% acetic acid) and the other in water 10 minutes daily. Transepidermal water loss and pH were measured pre- and post-treatment. RESULTS: In both groups, transepidermal water loss increased and pH decreased at 0 minutes post-ACV treatment, but these effects were not sustained at 60 minutes. In total, 72.7% (16/22) of subjects reported mild side effects from ACV with improvement after discontinuing the soaks. CONCLUSIONS: Dilute ACV soaks have no significant effect on skin barrier integrity but caused skin irritation in a majority of subjects. Study limitations include analysis of a single brand, dilution, and application of ACV. Future studies are needed to explore whether lower concentrations of ACV soaks or other applications such as a leave-on acidic ointment could improve skin barrier integrity in a safe, nonirritating way.",

Five experimental diets were evaluated in this study including diets supplemented with 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0% of ACV, 0.5% propionic acid, and a control diet with no supplements. Shrimps (initial weight of 10.2 ± 0.04 g) in triplicate groups with the density of 25 shrimps per tank were fed the diets for 60 days. At the end of the feeding trial, shrimps fed with ACV and PA supplemented diets had significantly higher total protein level than those fed the control diet (P < 0.05). The number of Vibrio spp., R-cells (lipid storage cells) of hepatopancreas and cholesterol level in shrimps fed the diets containing ACV and PA were lower compared to the control group (P < 0.05). However, there was no remarkable variations in glucose concentration, B-cell number and tubule diameter among the experimental diets (P > 0.05). In addition, shrimps fed the ACV diets had significantly lower total heterotrophic marine bacteria compared to the control or PA groups, and the lowest bacterial number was observed in shrimp fed 4% ACV supplemented diet (P < 0.05). Supplementation of 2 and 4% ACV as well as 0.5% PA in the diet led to a significantly higher calcium concentration than the control treatment (P < 0.05). The lowest triglyceride concentration was observed in the shrimps fed diets containing 2.0 and 4.0% ACV, which resulted in 15 and 20% reduction, respectively (P < 0.05). Overall, the findings indicates that ACV and PA possess antimicrobial activity and demonstrate beneficial effects on health status, so they can be potentially used as feed additive in the feeding of L. vannamei.",

The study has adopted an observational approach to evaluate the anticoccidial effect of apple cider vinegar on broiler chicken. The antioxidative changes were measured adding natural apple cider vinegar to drinking water. Four hundred and fifty broiler chickens were purchased from the local market and distributed into three groups (T+vc: positive control, T-vc: negative control Tv: apple cider vinegar) with 150 chickens in each group. The three groups were further replicated into 3 blocks each containing 50 chickens. The groups were fed balanced diet, amprolium was added to the feed of positive control group, and apple cider vinegar was added to the water of Tv group. Measurements of the different variables were started from week 3, at the end of each week 3 birds were chosen randomly, blood samples were collected via the wing vein, and fecal oocysts were counted from intestinal contents of each individual bird using the McMaster technique. Broiler in the control groups T+ve and T-ve showed clinical signs of coccidiosis (blood in feces) and the number of coccidial oocytes in feces increased with time. In the vinegar group, no clinical signs of coccidiosis were observed. Concentrations of total antioxidants and catalase enzyme activity significantly increased (p≤0.05); while malondialdehyde concentration significantly decreased (p≤0.05).",

      "abstract": "The global escalation in antibiotic resistance cases means alternative antimicrobials are essential. The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial capacity of apple cider vinegar (ACV) against E. coli, S. aureus and C. albicans. The minimum dilution of ACV required for growth inhibition varied for each microbial species. For C. albicans, a 1/2 ACV had the strongest effect, S. aureus, a 1/25 dilution ACV was required, whereas for E-coli cultures, a 1/50 ACV dilution was required (p < 0.05). Monocyte co-culture with microbes alongside ACV resulted in dose dependent downregulation of inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-6). Results are expressed as percentage decreases in cytokine secretion comparing ACV treated with non-ACV treated monocytes cultured with E-coli (TNFα, 99.2%; IL-6, 98%), S. aureus (TNFα, 90%; IL-6, 83%) and C. albicans (TNFα, 83.3%; IL-6, 90.1%) respectively. Proteomic analyses of microbes demonstrated that ACV impaired cell integrity, organelles and protein expression. ACV treatment resulted in an absence in expression of DNA starvation protein, citrate synthase, isocitrate and malate dehydrogenases in E-coli; chaperone protein DNak and ftsz in S. aureus and pyruvate kinase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, fructose bisphosphate were among the enzymes absent in C.albican cultures. The results demonstrate ACV has multiple antimicrobial potential with clinical therapeutic implications.",

      "abstract": "The present study was performed to investigate the immunomodulatory and health promoting effects of combined or singular administration of apple cider vinegar (ACV) and Lactobacillus casei in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) diet. An 8-week feeding trial was designed with following treatments: Control (basal diet), Pro (contains 107 CFU g-1L. casei), LACV (contains 1% ACV), HACV (contains 2% ACV), Pro + LACV (contains 107 CFU g-1L. casei plus 1% ACV) and Pro + HACV (contains 107 CFU g-1L. casei plus 2% ACV). Evaluation of skin mucus revealed notable increase of total Ig level and lysozyme activity in Pro + LACV and Pro + HACV treatments compared other groups (P < 0.05). Similarly, serum total Ig and lysozyme activity in HACV, Pro + LACV and Pro + HACV fed carps was remarkably higher than other groups (P < 0.05). However, regarding serum alternative complement (ACH50) activity significant difference was observed just between Pro + HACV and control treatment (P < 0.05). The highest expression of immune related (LYZ, TNF-alpha, IL1b, IL8) and antioxidant enzymes genes (GSR, GST) were observed in carps fed Pro + HACV and Pro + LACV. The expression of GH gene expression in Pro, LACV and HACV treatments was significantly higher than those in control group (P < 0.05). The highest expression level of GH and IGF1 was observed in fish fed combined Pro and ACV (P < 0.05). These results indicated that co-administration of ACV boosted immunomodulatory and health promoting effects of L. casei and can be considered as a promising immunostimulants in early stage of common carp culture.",

      "abstract": "Organic apple cider vinegar is produced from apples that go through very restricted treatment in orchard. During the first stage of the process, the sugars from apples are fermented by yeasts to cider. The produced ethanol is used as a substrate by acetic acid bacteria in a second separated bioprocess. In both, the organic and conventional apple cider vinegars the ethanol oxidation to acetic acid is initiated by native microbiota that survived alcohol fermentation. We compared the cultivable acetic acid bacterial microbiota in the production of organic and conventional apple cider vinegars from a smoothly running oxidation cycle of a submerged industrial process. In this way we isolated and characterized 96 bacteria from organic and 72 bacteria from conventional apple cider vinegar. Using the restriction analysis of the PCR-amplified 16S-23S rRNA gene ITS regions, we identified four different HaeIII and five different HpaII restriction profiles for bacterial isolates from organic apple cider vinegar. Each type of restriction profile was further analyzed by sequence analysis of the 16S-23S rRNA gene ITS regions, resulting in identification of the following species: Acetobacter pasteurianus (71.90%), Acetobacter ghanensis (12.50%), Komagataeibacter oboediens (9.35%) and Komagataeibacter saccharivorans (6.25%). Using the same analytical approach in conventional apple cider vinegar, we identified only two different HaeIII and two different HpaII restriction profiles of the 16S‒23S rRNA gene ITS regions, which belong to the species Acetobacter pasteurianus (66.70%) and Komagataeibacter oboediens (33.30%). Yeasts that are able to resist 30 g/L of acetic acid were isolated from the acetic acid production phase and further identified by sequence analysis of the ITS1-5.8S rDNA‒ITS2 region as Candida ethanolica, Pichia membranifaciens and Saccharomycodes ludwigii. This study has shown for the first time that the bacterial microbiota for the industrial production of organic apple cider vinegar is clearly more heterogeneous than the bacterial microbiota for the industrial production of conventional apple cider vinegar. Further chemical analysis should reveal if a difference in microbiota composition influences the quality of different types of apple cider vinegar."

      "abstract": "This experiment was conducted to study the effect of various levels of ACV® and Propionic acid (PA) on expression of immune related genes and growth performance in white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). Three hundred and seventy-five shrimps with an average initial weight of 10.2 ± 0.04 g were collected and acclimatized for two weeks. Five experimental diets including control diet, 0.5% PA diet and 1%, 2% and 4% ACV® diets were applied to feed the shrimps. They were fed 4 times a day with 2.5% of body weight. After 60 days of culture, shrimps fed with ACV® and PA diets showed no significant difference in growth performance. Expression of prophenoloxidase (proPo), lysozyme (Lys), penaeidin-3a (Pen-3a) and Crustin (Cru) genes were determined from hepatopancreas, using the real-time PCR after 15, 30 and 60 days. Expression of Lys and proPo genes was significantly up regulated in shrimps fed with ACV® and PA diets compared to the control group after 30 and 60 days of treatment. After 15 days, Pen-3a gene expression was significantly higher in PA group compared to the control group. Also, shrimps fed with 1% and 4% ACV® and PA diets showed significantly increased expression of Pen-3a after 30 days. In contrast, expression of Cru was significantly down regulated in response to ACV® diets, but, Cru expression in treated shrimps with PA diet was greater than the control group after 30 and 60 days. Overall, the results provided evidence that ACV® could be used as a natural immunostimulant for shrimps in order to adjust and enhance expression of the immune related genes.",

Four groups of ten female mice were treated as follows: Group I received no treatment and was used as control. Group II was OVX mice. Group III received ACV intragastrically (0.6% of feed), and group IV was OVX and was treated with ACV as described for group III. The treatment was continued for 28 days, during which the mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet. The lipid peroxidation levels in erythrocyte, liver and kidney, triglycerides, total, and VLDL cholesterol levels in serum were higher in the OVX group than in groups III and IV. The levels of vitamin E in liver, the kidney and erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and erythrocyte-reduced glutathione (GSH) were decreased in group II. The GSH-Px, vitamin C, E, and β-carotene, and the erythrocyte GSH and GSH-Px values were higher in kidney of groups III and IV, but in liver the vitamin E and β-carotene concentrations were decreased. In conclusion, ACV induced a protective effect against erythrocyte, kidney, and liver oxidative injury, and lowered the serum lipid levels in mice fed high cholesterol, suggesting that it possesses oxidative stress scavenging effects, inhibits lipid peroxidation, and increases the levels of antioxidant enzymes and vitamin.",
