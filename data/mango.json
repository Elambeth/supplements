      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Pharmacovigilance (PV) systems to assess the safety of antiretroviral treatment used periconception and during pregnancy are lacking in low-resource settings with high HIV burdens, and strategies to guide their implementation are limited. We implemented the Measuring Adverse Pregnancy and Newborn Congenital Outcomes (MANGO) study in Kenya to address these gaps. PARTICIPANTS: In MANGO, we ascertained delivery outcomes for pregnant women living with HIV (WLH) and not living with HIV (WNLH) enrolled in care at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) through two cohorts: C1, a prospective cohort of 1:1 matched WLH and WNLH attending antenatal clinic; and C2, a cross-sectional cohort of all deliveries, including among those who did not attend antenatal clinic at MTRH. FINDINGS TO DATE: 24 205 deliveries were recorded from October 2020 to September 2023 (853 in C1 and 23 352 in C2). Median maternal age was 32 years, 4.5% were WLH and 2.6% of deliveries were stillbirths. Among liveborn infants, 17.2% were preterm (<37 weeks), and 15.1% were low birth weight (<2.5 kg). Prevalence of ≥1 major congenital abnormality was 73.9/10 000 births (47.7 in C1 and 76.1 in C2). Assessing implementation barriers/facilitators, lack of national PV policy was a barrier overcome through establishing partnerships with the Kenya Ministry of Health. The facility's size and complexity were barriers to newborn surface exam coverage overcome through staff training and cocreation of a standardised form for newborn surface exam documentation. High staff turnover was addressed by involving head nurses to champion implementation and incentivising staff participation with medical education credits. Use of audit/feedback cycles and focusing on PV as a way to improve care quality facilitated PV institutionalisation at MTRH. FUTURE PLANS: The MANGO model is a multifaceted strategy with replicative potential in other settings. Research is needed to understand the model's opportunities for implementation in other settings.",

      "abstract": "In this study, the green synthesis of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) mediated by Azadirachta indica is reported, along with an evaluation of their antifungal activity against post-harvest anthracnose and their effects on the storage behaviour (shelf life) and physico-chemical properties of 'Kesar' mangoes, particularly those associated with the ripening process. The CuO NPs were initially synthesized using neem leaf extract and characterized through UV- Visible spectroscopy, SEM, EDX, HR-TEM, FT-IR, XRD, XPS, DLS and zeta potential. Characterization confirmed their monoclinic crystalline structure, spherical morphology, high purity, and stability, with a mean size of 50.93 nm and a zeta potential of -32.50 mV. The antifungal activities of synthesized CuO NPs against the fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides were assessed using poisoned food technique in which 1000 ppm CuO NPs showed lowest colony diameter (20.70 mm) and highest per cent growth inhibition (77.00 %). Subsequently in a dipping treatment lowest per cent disease incidence (00.00 %) were recorded in fruit treated with CuO NPs @ 200 ppm and 250 ppm, respectively. While, highest shelf life (18.23 days) were recorded in fruit treated with CuO NPs @ 250 ppm. Untreated control fruit exhibited increased per cent weight loss, total sugar, reducing sugar, non-reducing sugar and total soluble solids (TSS) over the storage period which responsible for early and rapid ripening. Post-harvest treatments of CuO NPs improved mango quality by reducing weight loss, retaining firmness, and delaying ripening through maintaining peel thickness, lower sugar levels, and higher titratable acidity and ascorbic acid. The 250 ppm concentration was most effective, ensuring safety with copper levels below toxicity thresholds. Therefore, A. indica-CuO NPs treatment is an eco-friendly and safe alternative to preserve fruit quality, reducing post-harvest disease/losses and extending the storage period (shelf life) of mango by delayed the ripening process.",

But has not yet been fully studied in mango. In this experiment, two pairs of homologous genes MiEXPA1s and MiEXPA4s were firstly excavated from mango genome. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of MiEXPA1a2 was gradually increased with the development of mango fruits, while MiEXPA4e1 has the opposite expression pattern. In this study, the functions of two genes were explored by overexpression in Arabidopsis and tomato. MiEXPLA1a2 and MiEXPA4e1 genes with opposite expression levels showed similar gene functions. Compared with wild-type Arabidopsis (WT), overexpression of MiEXPA1a2 and MiEXPA4e1 Arabidopsis promoted early flowering, increased rosette leaves number, caused dwarf plants, and reduced the number of seeds. In addition, MiEXPA1a2 and MiEXPA4e1 transgenic plants significantly increased root length and survival rate under drought and salt stress treatments. It was also found that MiEXPA1a2 and MiEXPA4e1 promoted root length in response to gibberellin treatment, while ABA significantly inhibited it. We found similar phenotypes to Arabidopsis in transgenic tomato plants, such as promoted early flowering, reduced plant height, increased sepal length, affected the fruit and seed quality. Interestingly, MiEXPA4e1 is significantly shorter the pod length in Arabidopsis and reduced the fruit weight in tomato, while MiEXPA1a2 does not have this phenomenon. In conclusion, MiEXPLA1a2 and MiEXPA4e1 genes have potential applications in regulating plant flowering, regulating phenotype, and improving stress response.",

      "abstract": "The GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) gene encodes a receptor integral to Gibberellic acid (GA) signaling, which is pivotal for plant growth, development, and stress responses. Until now, GID1 genes have not been documented in mango. In this research, the mango (Mangifera indica) genome yielded four GID1 homologous genes, and this study focuses on the research of MiGID1A and MiGID1B genes. Expression analysis indicated that MiGID1A is mainly expressed in leaves, while MiGID1B is predominantly found in flowers and buds. Both genes exhibited a significant upsurge in expression under salt and drought stress conditions. Moreover, the overexpression of these genes significantly advanced early flowering under long-day conditions. MiGID1A and MiGID1B transgenic plants showed significantly higher root length and survival rate than WT plants under drought and salt stress treatment. In addition, under drought and salt stress treatment, the contents of malonaldehyde (MAD) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decreased significantly, and the levels of proline (Pro) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) notably increased in the MiGID1A-OE and MiGID1B-OE transgenic plants. GA3 treatment significantly improved germination rates, root elongation, and early flowering in both MiGID1A-OE and MiGID1B-OE lines. At the same time, ABA treatment alleviated the inhibition of seed germination, root growth, and flowering in transgenic Arabidopsis. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays demonstrated that MiGID1A and MiGID1B were capable of interacting with DELLA family proteins. Existing reports have demonstrated that GID1 participates in various regulatory processes by promoting the degradation of DELLA proteins. SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein-like (SPL3a/b) and WRKY12a/b. The findings imply a significant regulatory function for the MiGID1A and MiGID1B genes in the processes of flowering, stress management, and gibberellin response.

      "abstract": "Mango (Mangifera indica L.), a climacteric fruit, undergoes rapid ripening driven by ethylene signaling, which plays a crucial role in modulating ascorbic acid (AsA) metabolism. AsA biosynthesis is primarily governed by the L-galactose pathway, with GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase (MiGalDH) catalyzing a key step. This study investigates the transcriptional regulation of MiGalDH by MiMYB1R1-like and MiMYB44-like during ethylene-mediated ripening. Ethylene treatment accelerated ripening and significantly reduced GalDH activity, leading to a decline in AsA levels. Notably, dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) content increased toward the end of storage, suggesting enhanced AsA turnover. RNA-seq analysis revealed that ethylene upregulated MiMYB1R1-like while downregulating MiMYB44-like. Functional assays, including Y1H, EMSA and Dual-Luc analyses, confirmed that both transcription factors directly bind to the MiGalDH promoter to regulate its expression. Virus-induced gene silencing of MiMYB1R1-like and MiMYB44-like significantly reduced MiGalDH expression and AsA content but increased GalDH activity, suggesting enhanced AsA turnover to maintain redox balance. Overexpression of MiMYB1R1-like sustained GalDH activity and promoted AsA biosynthesis throughout ripening, whereas MiMYB44-like overexpression exhibited stage-specific effects-enhancing GalDH activity early but repressing it later. Overall, our findings highlight the pivotal role of MiGalDH in AsA metabolism and identify MiMYB1R1-like and MiMYB44-like as key transcription factors. This study provides novel insights into the transcriptional control of ethylene-induced ripening and AsA metabolism, offering potential targets for improving fruit quality and extending shelf life."

      "abstract": "The contamination of water resources by heavy metals, such as lead ions, represents a serious environmental and public health problem, requiring effective treatment methods. This study evaluated the adsorptive potential of Tommy Atkins mango peel as a biosorbent for removing lead ions from synthetic aqueous solutions. The mango peels were obtained in the city of Crato, CE, dried in an oven at 313.15 K for 3 days, and then ground to a uniform powder. The material was characterized using x-ray fluorescence, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The fluorescence results indicated that the peel has a high potassium (5.093%) and calcium (2.170%) content, as well as significant incorporation of lead ions (28.882%) after the adsorption process. Infrared analysis identified functional groups such as ─OH, ─CH, ─C═O, and ─C─O, which are crucial for retaining metal ions. Electron microscopy images revealed a fibrous structure and uniform porosity, favoring adsorbent-adsorbate interaction. Kinetic studies showed that the pseudo-first-order model was the most suitable for describing the process, with an adjusted R2 of 0.96258. The equilibrium time was reached in 60 min, with an adsorption capacity of 9.65 mg g-1. Adsorption isotherms revealed that the Sips model provided the best fit to the experimental data, with maximum adsorption capacities of 72.57, 51.44, and 30.92 mg g-1 at temperatures of 278.15, 298.15, and 318.15 K, respectively, with greater efficiency observed at lower temperatures. Thermodynamic analysis indicated an exothermic process, with ΔH° (-53.97 kJ mol-1), ΔS° (-0.161 kJ mol-1 K-1), and negative ΔG° confirming the favorable and spontaneous nature of adsorption, alongside a reduction in system entropy. Tommy Atkins mango peel, therefore, demonstrates promising characteristics as a biosorbent, combining efficiency in the adsorption process with environmental sustainability due to its origin as agricultural waste. This study contributes to the valorization of plant by-products and expands the possibilities of accessible and sustainable solutions for the treatment of water contaminated by heavy metals."

However, the influence of L. rhamnosus on the quality of mango juice has not yet been determined. Therefore, the effects of L. rhamnosus FJG1530 on the physicochemical properties, physiological activity, and volatile and non-volatile compounds of mango juice were extensively examined in this study. The data showed that L. rhamnosus FJG1530 possessed strong adaptability to mango juice, reducing its total sugar and increasing its total flavonoids. L. rhamnosus FJG1530 fermentation enhanced the ability of mango juice to clear the free radicals ABTS and DPPH, as well as improving the inhibition of lipase and α-glucosidase. In addition, L. rhamnosus FJG1530 treatment improved the volatile compounds in mango juice, especially promoting the formation of acids and alcohols. Simultaneously, metabolomic analysis revealed that 592 non-volatile compounds in mango juice were significantly changed by L. rhamnosus FJG1530 fermentation, with 413 dramatically increased and 179 significantly decreased metabolites. This study demonstrates that the fermentation process using L. rhamnosus FJG1530 was beneficial for ameliorating the quality of mango juice."

      "abstract": "The control of powdery mildew disease is one of the main objectives in Mango production. Mango production with superior quality is becoming increasingly challenging due to climate change, which may negatively affect all stages of their development. Recently, Nanotechnology is a promising and rapidly evolving field that could be a very useful tool to raise the efficiency of fungicides. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of sulfur nanoparticles (SNPs) and reducing the incidence of powdery mildew, improving growth performance and productivity of mango cv. Keitt (Mangifera indica L.). Four concentrations of SNPs (0, 100, 300, and 500 ppm) were compared to sulfur microform (bulk) at a concentration of 500 ppm. At a private farm on Cairo Alex Desert Road K78, Egypt, foliar spray treatments were administered to an eight-year-old mango cv. Keitt grafted on Sukari rootstock. The experiment was conducted using a randomized complete block design, with each tree receiving a five-liter spray of the solution. The results suggested that the use of 500 ppm concentration of SNPs led to reducing powdery mildew disease incidence by 8.8% but it negatively affected productivity, as it decreased by 27% compared to the control treatment. Whereas 100 ppm concentration of SNPs led to increasing the productivity by 342% compared to the control treatment, reducing powdery mildew disease incidence in mango was recorded at 14.6%. Furthermore, the TSS and vitamin C increased significantly by 16 Brix and 46.3 mg, respectively, in association with decreasing titratable acidity in fruits. In aggregate, our data demonstrated that 100 ppm and 300 ppm of sulfur nanoparticles was more efficient than 500 ppm of sulfur bulk in improving POD and PPO enzyme activity. It is recommended to add SNPs of 100 ppm as foliar spraying three times at 15-day intervals for alleviating the harmful impact of disease on mango trees by improving the enzyme activity, thereby yield, and fruit quality of mango trees exposed to powdery mildew disease.",

The present study investigated the effect of regular mango intake on inflammation and insulin sensitivity in participants with overweight or obesity and chronic low-grade inflammation. Methods: A human clinical study was performed using a randomized, controlled, two-arm, parallel design with a 2 h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) administered before and after 4 weeks (4 W) of mango or control product intake (1 cup/twice a day). Fasting and time course blood sampling for 2 h post-OGTT were analyzed for effects on plasma metabolic and inflammation endpoints using analysis of covariance and repeated-measure approaches (SAS 9.4). Results: Forty-eight adults (37.6 ± 2.8 years, 30.5 ± 4.1 BMI kg/m2) completed the study. Markers of inflammation (IL-6, TNFα, hs-CRP) were not different at the end of 4 W (p > 0.05). The intervention did not significantly influence fasting glucose concentrations; however, insulin was significantly lowered with the mango compared to the control intervention (8.2 ± 1.2 vs. 15.3 ± 1.2 µIU/mL respectively, p = 0.05). Furthermore, the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), along with the disposition index (DI), was significantly improved in the mango compared to the control interventions (HOMA-IR, 2.28 ± 1.19 vs. 4.67 ± 1.21, p = 0.03; DI, 2.76 ± 1.02 vs. 5.37 ± 1.03, p = 0.04). Mean insulin concentrations were also significantly lower at W4 compared to W0 after the OGTT in the mango vs. control intervention (intervention × week effect, p = 0.04). Relative expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), a gene regulating endogenous antioxidant defense, was non-significantly increased twofold in the mango intervention (W4 vs. W0). Conclusions: Collectively, the data suggest that mango intake increased insulin sensitivity in individuals with chronic low-grade inflammation, possibly through activating Nrf-2 genes and increasing cellular antioxidant status. The data warrant further research on consuming mango fruit as part of a dietary pattern to address insulin resistance and the mechanisms underpinning the actions of mango intake.",

The modified biochar exhibited strong magnetic properties (19.803 emu/g) and a specific surface area of 30.456 m2/g, facilitating easy separation after adsorption. Using Response Surface Methodology-Central Composite Design (RSM-CCD), the adsorption model demonstrated high accuracy (F-value: 315.510, p < 0.0001, R2 = 0.9959). Thermodynamic analysis indicated that the process was endothermic and spontaneous, driven by physical interactions, with positive enthalpy and negative Gibbs free energy values. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model best described the adsorption, highlighting significant chemical interactions, while the Freundlich isotherm suggested adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces. The maximum TC adsorption capacities for MKB and its magnetic composite were 27.050 mg/g and 42.670 mg/g, respectively. The RL, n, and E parameters confirmed the desirability and physical nature of the interactions (0-1,〉1, and < 8 kJ/mol, respectively). The intraparticle diffusion model indicated multiple mechanisms were involved, and the biochar maintained excellent performance across reuse cycles, making it a highly effective and reusable adsorbent for water and wastewater treatment.",

The influence of innovative sonicated zein/TEO-based NEs (ZTNEs) as nanofillers on the physico-mechanical characteristics of the resulting P/CMCS edible films was investigated. A stable and well-dispersed ZTNE was achieved using 20 % zein with 10 min of ultrasound treatment, leading to a reduced droplet size (194.23 ± 0.41 nm) and high ζ-potential (-48.72 ± 0.74 mV). Furthermore, the homogeneity of the ZTNE dispersion, evaluated via confocal laser microscopy (CLSM) analysis, indicated that it can be uniformly incorporated into P/CMCS edible films. In addition, the incorporation of ZTNE into P/CMCS edible films improved barrier properties, mechanical strength, oxidative stability, and antimicrobial properties compared with P/CMCS edible films without ZTNE, possibly due to hydrogen bonding in the film matrix, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs as well as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Interestingly, the results indicated that P/CMCS/ZTNE/US 10 min and P/CMCS/ZTNE 4 % films demonstrated substantial antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (11.54 ± 0.72 and 16.62 ± 1.13 mm, respectively) and Staphylococcus aureus (12.81 ± 1.03 and 14.13 ± 0.69 mm), respectively. Moreover, P/CMCS/ZTNE/US 10 min and P/CMCS/ZTNE 4 % films were found to be effective in mango preservation over a 12-day storage period at 25 °C ± 1 °C, as assessed by fruit firmness, weight loss, total soluble solid content, total phenolic content, lipoxygenase activity, and electronic nose analysis. Consequently, these findings indicate that P/CMCS/ZTNE edible films may function as an effective biodegradable packaging solution for fruit preservation within the food industry.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer (OvC) constitutes significant management challenges primarily due to its late-stage diagnosis and the development of resistance to chemotherapy. The standard treatment regimen typically includes carboplatin and paclitaxel, with the addition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) harboring BRCA1/2 mutations. However, the variability in treatment responses suggests the need to investigate factors beyond BRCA1/2 mutations, such as DNA repair mechanisms and epigenetic alterations. Notably, homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD) is observed in an additional 20% of HGSOC cases, indicating a broader spectrum of DNA repair defects. Existing commercial HRD assays have certain limitations, prompting a global effort to develop new genomic and functional tests through academic research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study investigates, in the 187 high-grade serous and endometrioid tumors from the MITO16/MaNGO-OV-2 trial, academic HRD genomic tests in conjunction with a RAD51 immunofluorescence assay to assess functional activation of HRD. Additionally, the study incorporates analysis of microRNA-506 (miR-506) expression as a putative epigenetic effector. RESULTS: The RAD51 test identified HRD in 73% of the samples and genomic HRD testing in 57%, with HRD identified in 45% of samples by both tests. The significant discrepancy between the two assays emphasizes the need to refine tumor classification for HRD. A three-group genomic classification unveiled superior progression-free survival (PFS) in high- and mild-HRD tumors compared with negative-HRD tumors. High concordance between RAD51 and genomic testing in high-HRD tumors suggests a subset of 'super-HRD' tumors exhibiting superior PFS. High expression of miR-506 may be used to further refine HRD status. CONCLUSIONS: The study underscores the complexities of HRD assessment and advocates for a combined genomic and functional approach to enhance predictive accuracy in OvC treatment responses.",

      "abstract": "Salinity stress disrupts water uptake and nutrient absorption, causing reduced photosynthesis, stunted growth, and decreased crop yields in plants. The use of indole acetic acid (IAA), arginine (AN), and mango fruit waste biochar (MFWB) can be effective methods to overcome this problem. Indole acetic acid (IAA) is a natural auxin hormone that aids cell elongation and division, thereby increasing plant height and branching. L-arginine, an amino acid, is crucial for plant defense mechanisms, forming proline, polyamines, and nitric oxide, which regulate biological activities and prevent oxidative damage. Mango fruit waste biochar enhances soil fertility and water retention, thereby enhancing fruit development and yield. This study investigates the effects of combining IAA and AN as amendments to fenugreek, with and without MFWB. Four treatments (control, 2mM IAA, 250 mg/L AN, and 250 mg/L AN + 2mM IAA) study were conducted in four replications using a completely randomized design. Results demonstrate that the 250 mg/L AN + 2mM IAA with MFWB treatment led to a significant rise in fenugreek plant length (30.26%), plant fresh weight (36.37%), and plant dry weight (15.78%) over the control under salinity stress. There was a notable increase in chlorophyll a (5.13%), chlorophyll b (14.06%), total chlorophyll (7.79%), and shoot N, P, K from the control under salinity stress also showing the potential of 250 mg/L AN + 2mM IAA with MFWB. In conclusion, applying 250 mg/L AN + 2mM IAA with MFWB is a strategy for alleviating salinity stress in fenugreeks.",

      "abstract": "Mango anthracnose, mainly caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, is the major destructive postharvest disease of mango during storage and transport. Dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS), an organic volatile found in some microorganisms or plants, inhibited growth of C. gloeosporioides in vitro, but its effects on mango anthracnose and its molecular mechanisms of action have not been well characterized. In this study, the EC50 of DMTS against Colletotrichum spp. from mango mainly ranged from 2.3 to 20.0 μL/L. In vivo, the fumigation rates of 20 μL/L of DMTS for 24 h, or 80 μL/L for 3 h or 6 h could effectively reduce severity of anthracnose (natural inoculum) on postharvest mangoes with inhibitory effects of 61.7 %, 65.7 %, and 69.4 %, respectively, as observed 10 days after treatment. Furthermore, there was no detectable DMTS residue in mango skin or flesh, and an overall improvement in the quality of the fruit with higher soluble solids, total sugars, vitamin c, and β-carotene, and lower titratable acidity than the non-treated control. In addition, DMTS could significantly reduce ergosterol content in mycelia of C. gloeosporioides, and gene expression analysis showed DMTS significantly suppressed expression of ergosterol biosynthesis-related genes Cgerg6 and Cgerg11 after mycelia were exposed to DMTS. Knock-out mutants for each of these two genes showed reduced sensitivity to DMTS. After gene complementation in situ, the sensitivity of complementary transformants to DMTS was restored to that of the parental strain. Therefore, we concluded that the genes Cgerg6 and Cgerg11 are involved in an interaction with the antifungal activity of DMTS. This is the first study to demonstrate a control effect of DMTS on mango postharvest anthracnose resulting in reduced disease severity and enhanced fruit quality. Transformant studies also revealed some potential molecular mechanisms of the antifungal activity of DMTS that may lead to improved management of mango postharvest anthracnose.",

Melatonin (MT) is a natural bioactive molecule that has multiple physiological functions in plants. This study investigated the effect of exogenous MT on mango disease resistance against C. gloeosporioides and related molecular mechanism. MT treatment at 1 mmol L-1 limited the expansion of anthracnose in mango inoculated with C. gloeosporioides, which was associated with increased level of defense-related indexes, including activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL) and peroxidase (POD), expression of MiPAL, Mi4CL and MiPOD and contents of total phenolics, flavonoids and lignin. RT-qPCR analysis of 15 MiWRKY members revealed that MiWRKY45 had the highest expression in response to MT + C. gloeosporioides. MiWRKY45 transcription factor was identified as a nucleus-localized transcriptional activator based on subcellular localization and transcriptional activation assays. MiWRKY45 bound to W-box motif and activated the expression of MiPAL, Mi4CL and MiPOD, as verified by DNA affinity purification-seq (DAP-seq), yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and dual-luciferase reporter (DLR) assays. Transient transformation analysis revealed that MiWRKY45 positively regulated phenylpropanoid pathway, thereby enhancing mango resistance. These results suggest that MiWRKY45, as a positive regulator, is involved in MT-induced resistance against anthracnose in mangoes.",

An untargeted metabolomic approach based on ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was carried out to investigate the differences between artificially ripened and naturally ripened mangoes. The principal component analysis results indicate a clear separation between the different treatment groups. Variance analysis, fold change, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were employed to find potential markers. In total, 69 metabolites were identified, with significant variations in the abundance of organic acids, vitamins, carbohydrates, and polyphenols closely related to the ripening methods of mangoes. These results contribute to a better understanding of the metabolic changes in mangoes due to different ripening methods, which could be used to assist in evaluating the quality of mango fruit."

However, prochloraz resistance has been detected in L. theobromae. This study aimed to explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for prochloraz resistance in L. theobromae. The results show that no point mutation in the target gene LtCYP51 of the prochloraz-resistant L. theobromae strain was detected, but the expression was upregulated significantly. Additionally, the full-length sequences of the cytochrome P450 gene CYP55A3 were successfully amplified and identified from L. theobromae, and the qRT-PCR results confirm that CYP55A3 was significantly upregulated after treatment with prochloraz. The knockout mutant of the CYP55A3 presented significantly lower gene expression levels than the wild-type strain HL02, with a 16.67-fold reduction, but a 1.34-fold reduction in P450 activities and a 1.72-fold increase in the accumulation of prochloraz in the mycelia. Treatment with the P450 enzyme inhibitor significantly synergized with the prochloraz toxicity. The wild-type strain was highly resistant to pyraclostrobin and carbendazim; similarly, the sensitivity of the knockout mutant to pyraclostrobin and carbendazim also notably increased. There was no significant difference between the wild-type strain and the gene-complemented strain. The homology model and molecular docking analysis provide evidence that prochloraz interacts with the protein structure of CYP55A3. These findings suggest that the overexpression of the target gene LtCYP51 and the detoxification gene CYP55A3 were involved in the molecular mechanisms of resistance to prochloraz by L. theobromae."

Freshly harvested 'Keitt' mangoes were subjected to: CP treatment (for 5 min (CP5) and 10 min, CP10), dipping in \"Chronos Prochloraz\" for 30 s (industry practice), and untreated group (control). All samples were stored at 11 °C for 30 days, prior to minimal processing and hot air drying at 60 °C. Results after 30 days of storage demonstrated that untreated samples (control) had the highest TSS (15.06 ± 0.32 °Brix), while CP10 pretreated samples had the lowest TSS (13.80 ± 0.06 °Brix) value (p ≤ 0.05). In comparison to the fresh samples post storage, all pretreated dried mango slices retained lower total flavanols with CP5 (13.49 ± 1.64 mg GAE 100/g), CP10 (20.12 ± 1.42 mg GAE 100/g) and SMB (23.89 ± 3.35 mg GAE 100/g), but higher than the dried untreated samples (6.68 ± 0.53 mg GAE 100/g).

METHODS: Here, by using immunohistochemistry followed by digital pathology, we investigated the expression of several markers related to glycolysis including monocarboxylate transporter 1 and 4 (MCT1, MCT4), glutamine metabolism (glutaminase, GLS) and hypoxia/acidosis (carbonic anhydrase 9, CA IX) in tissue microarrays of > 300 patients recruited in the MITO16A clinical trial, which involved treatment of ovarian cancer patients with carboplatin/taxol plus bevacizumab. RESULTS: Regarding the prognostic impact of these markers, results indicate that GLS expression correlated with progression-free survival, but this effect disappeared when data were corrected for multiple testing. All other markers showed no correlation with clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: These results indicate marked heterogeneity of expression of metabolism-associated markers in ovarian cancer; however, there was a lack of association with clinical benefit after chemotherapy/anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment. Notwithstanding the lack of prognostic value, knowledge of the pattern of expression of these biomarkers in tumors can be useful for patient stratification purposes when new drugs targeting these metabolic pathways will be tested.",

      "abstract": "The rising environmental problem of plastic packaging waste has led to the development of sustainable alternatives, particularly for food packaging. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biodegradable, thermoplastic polyesters. They are employed in the production of various products, including packaging films. The bio-based nature and appropriate features of PHAs, similar to conventional synthetic plastics, have garnered significant attention from researchers and industries. The current study aimed to produce biodegradable food packaging using mango peel (a major agricultural waste) with enzymatic hydrolysis and PHAs synthesis. Mango peel is the hub for macro-and micronutrients, including phytochemicals. The process includes an enzymatic hydrolysis step that converts complex carbohydrates into simple sugars using mango peel as a substrate. The produced sugars are used as raw materials for bacteria to synthesize PHAs, which are a class of biodegradable polymers produced by these microorganisms that can serve as packaging materials in the food industry. To solve environmental problems and increase the utilization of agricultural by-products, this review presents a practical method for producing food packaging that is environmentally friendly."

      "abstract": "Current treatments for severe acne include combinations of synthetic anti-inflammatory and antibacterial drugs, which possess numerous side effects. Therefore, this study developed microemulsion-based hydrogel containing lemongrass leaf essential oil (Cymbopogon citratus (DC.) Stapf) and mango seed kernel extract (Mangifera indica Linn) as a potential natural therapy for inflammatory acne. To this end, the microemulsions were first prepared using pseudo-ternary phase diagrams with soybean oil and coconut oil, cremophor RH40, and PEG 400. The optimal formula could load 1% lemongrass oil and 10% mango extract, possessed a spherical droplet size of ~18.98 nm, a zeta potential of -5.56 mV, and a thermodynamic stability. Secondly, the microemulsion-based hydrogel was developed by simple mixing the optimal microemulsion in carbopol-940 hydrogel (3.5% w/w). The product showed a viscosity of ~3728 cPs, a pH of 5.4-6.2, a spreadability of ~24 cm, an in-vitro Franz-cell cumulative release rate of ~80% for polyphenol content and ~60% for citral within 12 h, and a good physicochemical stability of > 3 months. Thirdly, the skin compatibility/irritability of the microemulsion-based hydrogel was determined by the HET-CAM assay, which showed non-irritation level. Finally, the anti-inflammatory activities of the hydrogel, using heat-induced BSA denaturation assay and LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 NO inhibition assay, was 4-times higher than that of the reference drug Klenzit-C® (adapalene and clindamycin gel). Moreover, the hydrogel possessed strong anti-biofilm activity in Cutibacterium acnes, comparable with Klenzit-C®. Conclusively, the microemulsion-based hydrogel containing lemongrass oil and mango seed extract demonstrated much potentials to be a promising natural drug for acne treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postharvest mango fruit are highly susceptible to rapid ripening, softening and senescence, greatly limiting their distribution. In this study, we evaluated the potential effects of carvacrol (0.06 g L-1) on mango (25 ± 1 °C) and the mechanisms by which it regulates antioxidant activity, energy and cell wall metabolism. RESULTS: The results showed that carvacrol treatment delayed the 'Guifei' mango color transformation (from green to yellow) and the decrease in firmness, titratable acidity, weight loss and soluble solids content, and suppressed the increase in relative conductivity, malondialdehyde content and reactive oxygen species (H2O2 and O2 ·-) as well as enhancing antioxidant activity. In addition, carvacrol treatment increased ascorbic acid and reduced glutathione levels, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase, monodehydroascorbate reductase and dehydroascorbate reductase activities in mango. Meanwhile, energy level (adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, adenosine monophosphate and energy charge) content and energy metabolizing enzyme activities (H+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, succinate dehydrogenasepears and cytochrome C oxidase) were increased on carvacrol treatment, which resulted in the maintenance of higher energy levels. Finally, the application of carvacrol was effective in maintaining firmness and cell wall components by inhibiting the activities of polygalacturonase, cellulase, pectin methyl esterase and β-galactosidase. CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates that carvacrol effectively delays the ripening and softening of mangoes by modulating energy metabolism and cell wall dynamics through the attenuation of oxidative stress. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

In the context of the MITO16A/MaNGO OV-2 trial, a Phase IV study of chemotherapy combined with BEV in first-line treatment of advanced OC, we evaluated TP53 mutations by next-generation sequencing and p53 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on 202 and 311 cases, respectively. We further correlated TP53 mutations in terms of type, function, and site, and IHC data with patients' clinicopathological characteristics and survival. TP53 missense mutations of unknown function (named unclassified) represented the majority of variants in our population (44.4%) and were associated with a significantly improved overall survival (OS) both in univariable (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.20-0.92, p = .03) and multivariable analysis (HR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.18-0.86, p = .02). Concordance between TP53 mutational analysis and IHC was 91%. We observed an HR of 0.70 for OS in patients with p53 IHC overexpression compared to p53 wild-type, which however did not reach statistical significance (p = .31, 95% CI = 0.36-1.38). Our results indicate that the presence of unclassified TP53 mutations has favorable prognostic significance in patients with OC receiving upfront BEV plus chemotherapy. In particular, unclassified missense TP53 mutations characterize a subpopulation of patients with a significant survival advantage, independently of clinicopathological characteristics. Our findings warrant future investigations to confirm the prognostic impact of TP53 mutations in BEV-treated OC patients and deserve to be assessed for their potential predictive role in future randomized clinical studies.",

      "abstract": "In subtropical regions, April to June represents a temporary moisture stress for mango trees, leading to huge economic loss. Although water is available in the deep root zone, the upper soil surface, which has fibrous roots, is dry, and the tree transpiration rate is high. Moisture stress causes an increased oxidation state, which is detrimental to fruit growth and development. Finding substitutes for moisture stress management is important for sustainable mango production. To manage this moisture stress in mango, we tested if foliar application of 20, 50, 100 and 150 μM melatonin helped to maintain a reduced oxidation state in the cells. Applications were made at three phenological stages of fruit development (marble, egg and mature fruit stages) in 16-year-old trees and the same plants for each treatment were followed over three years. Melatonin application indeed improved the fruit yield of mango. Moisture stress decreased yield by 55.94% compared to irrigated trees but only by 7.5% in melatonin treatment. Also, more 'A' grade fruits were harvested in irrigated and melatonin-treated conditions than in non-irrigated and non-treated conditions. Indeed, the total chlorophyll content in the leaves of moisture-stressed melatonin-treated trees (12.58 mg.g-1 fresh weight) was well above non-treated trees (6.77 mg.g-1) and similar to irrigated trees (12.50 mg.g-1). A dose-dependent increase in the chlorophyll content of melatonin-treated plants was found. Similarly, the activities of catalase, peroxidase, superoxidase dismutase enzymes in leaves of irrigated and melatonin-treated trees were lower than in non-irrigated condition, and superoxide free radial formation was lower in moisture-stressed melatonin-treated trees (0.77 nmol H2O2.mg-1 protein) and irrigated trees (0.65) than moisture-stressed non-treated trees (4.27). Significant variations was found in antioxidants (total, reduced and oxidized glutathione and ascorbate) content and antioxidant enzymes' activities (i.e., glutathione reductase and ascorbate peroxidase) in irrigated, melatonin-treated and non-irrigated conditions. Overall, 150 μM exogenous melatonin applied three times at different fruit development stages may be a sustainable and useful approach to manage transient moisture stress in mango trees thanks to its positive action on the antioxidant system.",

      "abstract": "White mango scale (WMS) Aulacaspis tubercularis Newstead (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) is a polyphagous armored scale insect which is considered one of the key pests of mango (Mangifera indica L.) around the world. Mango is widely grown in Ethiopia whereas its production is challenged by WMS in the last decade. Effective formulations that could help manage the scale as part of IPM practice were sought from field experiments at Seka mango farm, Ethiopia in 2019 and 2020 seasons. The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of some formulations against WMS on mango trees. Randomized complete block designs with three replications were used for the experiments and each tree served as a plot. Allocation of each treatment within each replication was done randomly. The treatments were applied sequentially three times at 14 days interval using motorized Knapsack sprayer coinciding with peak period of natural infestation. Scale numbers before and after each spray were counted using a microscope with LCD. Sum of live crawler, female and male was registered as WMS count data. Results showed that dimethoate, diazinon, imidacloprid & λ-cyhalothrin sprayed alone; dimethoate rotated with imidacloprid & λ-cyhalothrin, chlorpyrifos-ethyl rotated with paraffin, and diazinon rotated with azadirachtin, caused total mortality of the scales. The results also showed that, chlorpyrifos-ethyl, deltamethrin, paraffin oil and λ-cyhalothrin sprayed alone caused percent reduction with range 83-95 % in both seasons. Hence, the study revealed that dimethoate, diazinon, imidacloprid & λ-cyhalothrin applied individually, dimethoate rotated with imidacloprid & λ-cyhalothrin, chlorpyrifos-ethyl rotated with paraffin and diazinon rotated with azadirachtin fully protect mango trees from WMS and significantly superior to other treatments. Therefore, chemical control of A. tubercularis may consider the use of these materials as foliar application and can be used as components for integrated pest management plans for WMS. However, application in the form of rotation is preferred to the alone spray as the former could substantially reduce the likelihood of inducing pesticide resistance. Cost implications and effects of the products on the natural enemy and residual toxicity in fruits need to be studied."

      "abstract": "Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is a popular fruit grown in tropical and subtropical regions. Mango has a distinctive aroma, flavour, and nutritional properties. Annual global mango production is >50 million tonnes. Major producers of mango include India, Bangladesh, China, Mexico, Pakistan, Indonesia, Brazil, Thailand, and the Philippines, and it is shipped worldwide. Harvested mango fruit are highly perishable, with a short shelf life. Physiological disorders are among the major factors limiting their postharvest quality and shelf life, including when fruit need phytosanitary treatments, such as hot water treatment, vapour heat treatment, and irradiation. This review focuses on problematic physiological disorders of mango flesh, including physiology and biochemistry. It considers factors contributing to the development and/or exacerbation of internal disorders. Improved production practices, including pruning, nutrient application, and irrigation, along with monitoring and managing environmental conditions (viz., temperature, humidity, and vapour pressure deficit), can potentially maintain fruit robustness to better tolerate otherwise stressful postharvest operations. As demand for mangoes on international markets is compromised by internal quality, robust fruit is crucial to maintaining existing and gaining new domestic and export consumer markets. Considering mango quality, a dynamic system, a more holistic approach encompassing pre-, at-, and post-harvest conditions as a continuum is needed to determine fruit predisposition and subsequent management of internal disorders."

Methyl salicylate (MeSA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) have been utilized to elevate the endogenous levels of SA and JA in horticultural products after harvest. However, their ability to preserve mango is uncertain. Individually and combined effects of exogenous MeSA and MeJA on mango ripening quality were investigated. 'Nam Dok Mai' mangoes were fumigated with MeSA, MeJA, and MeSA plus MeJA (MeSAJA) prior to storage for 6 d at 25 °C and 80-85% relative humidity (RH). Fruit ripening attributes, respiration rate, ethylene (ET) production, total phenolics (TP), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were assessed. Endogenous SA and JA levels were measured, as were the activities of lipoxygenase (LOX) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), and the expression of related genes MiPAL, MiICS, and MiLOX. Individual application of MeSA or MeJA preserved the mango quality by reducing ET production, respiration rate, and MDA levels while raising TP shortly after treatment. The ripening quality mirrored the induced SA and JA levels and correlated with the high expression of biosynthetic-related genes (MiPAL, MiICS, and MiLOX). Individual treatments stimulated SA and JA biosynthesis, demonstrating that these phytohormones are functionally connected and interdependent. When combined, MeSAJA caused a tradeoff response and distinct phenotypic outcomes compared to the individual treatments. As a result, MeSA fumigation is a practical method for preserving mango quality after harvest.",

One of the most important by-products is mango seed kernel (MSK), which can be used as a valuable energy source for feeding growing calves in the tropical and subtropical productive regions of the world. This study investigated the effect of replacing corn grains (CGs) with MSK on intake, nutrient digestibility, blood metabolites and rumen parameters. Eighteen growing male Friesian calves (200 ± 6.55 kg of body weight and 9-11 months old) were randomly assigned to three treatment groups. Three concentrate feed mixtures were formulated such that MSK replaced CG at 0%, 25% and 50%. Dry matter intake was unaffected, whereas dry matter, organic matter and fibre digestibility increased linearly (p < 0.05) with increased inclusion of MSK. Ruminal pH (p = 0.053) and total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration (p = 0.041) increased linearly. There was a linear decrease in cholesterol (p = 0.029) and AST (p = 0.028) levels in the blood of calves. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the positive effect of replacing 50% of CG with MSK on rumen parameters, including a higher ruminal pH and total VFA concentration, alongside higher nutrient digestibility. The dietary inclusion of mango seed can serve as a valuable and sustainable dietary component for growing calves.",

      "abstract": "Gibberellic acids (GAs) are a group of endogenous phytohormones that play important roles in plant growth and development. SLENDER RICE (SLR) serves as a vital component of the DELLA gene family, which plays an irreplaceable role in regulating plant flowering and height, as well as stress responses. SLR gene has not been reported in mango, and its function is unknown. In present study, two DELLA subfamily genes MiSLR1 and MiSLR2 were identified from mango. MiSLR1 and MiSLR2 were highly expressed in the stems of the juvenile stage, but were expressed at a low level in flower buds and flowers. Gibberellin treatment could up-regulate the expression of MiSLR1 and MiSLR2 genes, but gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor prohexadione-calcium (Pro-Ca) and paclobutrazol (PAC) treatments significantly down-regulated the expression of MiSLR1, while MiSLR2 was up-regulated. The expression levels of MiSLR1 and MiSLR2 were up-regulated under both salt and drought treatments. Overexpression of MiSLR1 and MiSLR2 genes significantly resulted early flowering in transgenic Arabidopsis and significantly up-regulated the expression levels of endogenous flower-related genes, such as SUPPRESSOR OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1), APETALA1 (AP1), and FRUITFULL (FUL). Interestingly, MiSLR1 significantly reduced the height of transgenic plants, while MiSLR2 gene increased. Overexpression of MiSLR1 and MiSLR2 increased seed germination rate, root length and survival rate of transgenic plants under salt and drought stress. Physiological and biochemical detection showed that the contents of proline (Pro) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly increased, while the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2 were significantly decreased. Additionally, protein interaction analysis revealed that MiSLR1 and MiSLR2 interacted with several flowering-related and GA-related proteins. The interaction between MiSLR with MiGF14 and MiSOC1 proteins was found for the first time. Taken together, the data showed that MiSLR1 and MiSLR2 in transgenic Arabidopsis both regulated the flowering time and plant height, while also acting as positive regulators of abiotic stress responses.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the effects of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens GSBa-1 treatment on anthracnose disease resistance and the metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phenylpropanoids in mangoes during storage. Mangoes were soaked in a solution containing 1 × 108 CFU/mL of B. amyloliquefaciens GSBa-1. The anthracnose disease incidence, disease index, respiration intensity, ethylene release, reactive oxygen species content, and the activities of related metabolic enzymes, phenylpropanoid-related metabolic enzymes, and phenolic acids in the skin and pulp of mangoes were investigated under normal temperature storage conditions. The results showed that the antagonistic bacterial treatment (ABT) did not significantly inhibit the growth of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in vitro. However, it significantly reduced the incidence of mango anthracnose disease when applied to the mango peel. ABT enhanced the latent resistance of mango to anthracnose disease by activating its reactive oxygen and phenylpropanoid metabolism. It maintained higher levels of ROS production and elimination in the peel. Moreover, it rapidly activated manganese superoxide dismutase, induced the accumulation of H2O2, and enhanced the activity of manganese superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and peroxidase in the mango peel. Furthermore, ABT activated phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamic acid-4-hydroxylase, 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase, and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase in the mango peel and pulp, promoting the accumulation of antifungal phenolic acids such as gallic acid, catechins, and ellagic acid. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens GSBa-1 may be a potent inhibitor of mango anthracnose, primarily enhancing the resistance of mangoes to anthracnose by synergistically activating ROS in the peel and phenylpropanoid metabolism in the pulp, thereby reducing the incidence of anthracnose effectively."

      "abstract": "The effect of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) treatments and storage conditions in the regulation of the physicochemical and bioactive properties of mango fruits (Mangifera indica L. cv. BARI-4) were investigated during storage. Different concentrations of 1-MCP treated samples (T0 = Control, T1 = 0.5 μL/L, T2 = 1.0 μL/L, T3 = 1.5 μL/L, and T4 = 2.0 μL/L) were stored in developed storage structure (10±1 °C and 90 % RH), cold storage (3 ± 1 °C and 80 ± 2 % RH), and ambient storage (29 ± 3 °C and 65 ± 2 % RH). The change in fruit quality including weight loss, firmness, surface color, storage life, chemical, and bioactive properties were studied periodically at 10, 20, 30 and 40 days of storage. The results demonstrated that 1-MCP treatment effectively maintained the quality of fruits by retarding the loss of weight, firmness, total soluble solids (TSS), and titratable acidity, which were served as a quality parameter during storage. The 1-MCP treatment dramatically delayed the change in color, quality measures, and bioactive properties compared to the control group. The storage condition greatly influenced the postharvest quality value and storage life. In combination with the developed storage structure and 1-MCP treatment preserved the acceptability of fruits to a great extent for around 40 days. The T2 = 1.0 μL/L 1-MCP treatment preserved the fruit quality for the highest days of storage 14, 34, and 46 days in ambient storage, cold storage, and develop storage structure respectively. The developed storage structure (10 ± 1 °C and 90 % RH) with 1-MCP (1.0 μL/L) treatment suggested the optimum storage ability for preserving the postharvest storage life of mango fruits. By implementing these findings mango growers and suppliers can reduce post-harvest losses, expand market reach, and provide consumers with high-quality mangoes that retain their quality for an extended period."

      "abstract": "Stem End Rot (SER) is a devastating post-harvest disease of mango fruits causing severe losses during storage. In 22 July 2023, 31 out of 50 intact mangoes (cv. Sensation) collected from five orchards in Huaping county (26°37'N 101°15') showed typical symptoms of SER after stored for 9 d in room temperature (24-28℃). Initially, small dark brown to black spots appeared around the fruit peduncle, which rapidly expanded through the pulp tissues. The symptomatic mangoes were surface disinfected by 3% NaClO for 30 s after soaking in 75% alcohol for 3 min, and cleaned by sterile water for 3 times. Tissues were cut from the edge of lesions, dried by sterile filter paper, transferred to PDA and cultured at 28 ℃ for 5 d (Tovar-Pedraza et al., 2020). The single-spore isolation method was used to obtain pure culture. Thirty eight isolates presented four distinct kind of morphology on PDA medium. Among them, 11 isolates with same morphology were significantly distinct from common pathogens of SER. The colonies were white and pale yellow on reverse side. Mycelia grew fast and reached the edge of 90 mm Petri dish after cultured for 5d. Pycnidia were black and scattered on the mycelial mats after 15-20 d. Conidia were fusoid, straight to slightly curved, four septa, and brown. Pigmented median cells doliiform, 14.97 - 18.62(16.11 ±0.89)×5.61- 7.28 (6.61±0.51) μm. Apical cell hyaline, subcylindrical; 1-3 tubular transparent apical appendages 12.27 - 16.68 (13.65±3.78)×1.14 - 1.99 (1.59±0.36) μm. Basal cell conical with a truncate base, hyaline, and 1-2 tubulose basal appendages with 2.85 - 7.97 (5.18±1.88)×0.99 - 1.85 (1.38±0.29) μm (n=50). These fungi were described as Pestalotiopsis kenyana. based on morphological characters (Maharachchikumbura et al., 2014) which were different from isolates characterized as other common SER pathogens (Botryosphaeria, Neofusicoccum). Based on morphology, HPSX-4 was selected for further identification. ITS region, tef1-α, β-tub of HPSX-4 were amplified and sequenced (Xun et al., 2023). The sequences were deposited in GenBank (ITS:OR889126, tef1-α:OR913431, β-tub: OR913432). The ITS, tef1-α, β-tub sequence of HPSX-4 showed 100% (525/525)，99.59% (241/242), and 100% (742/742) identity to the P. kenyana CBS442.67 sequences (ITS: NR147549，tef1-α: KM199502, β-tub: KM199395), respectively. HPSX-4 clustered with P. kenyana CBS 442.67 (type strain) based on maximum likelihood method by MEGA 7.0.21(Minh et al., 2013). Pathogenicity test was performed on 12 healthy mangoes (cv. Golek) by placing mycelial plugs around the peduncle and the middle of the fruit by pin-prick method according to Feng et al.(2023). Sterile PDA were used as control (three mangoes). Every inoculated fruit was incubated at 28°C, 95% ± 3% humidity with three replicates for each treatment. The experiment was repeated three times. Typical symptoms of SER were observed. There were no symptoms in the control group. The strain was reisolated and identified as P. kenyana with the method mentioned above which fulfilled Koch's postulates. This is the first report of P. kenyana causing SER disease on Mangifera indica L.. This study expands our understanding of the pathogen range of mango SER which conducive to prevent and control the SER caused by P. kenyana."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: The continuous use of anthelmintic drugs has led to global issues of resistance. One breakthrough to address this problem is the utilization of bio-anthelmintics derived from active compounds in agro-industrial waste. This in vivo study investigated the effectiveness of Podang mango (Mangifera indica L.) fruit peel waste extract for anthelmintic purposes, using concentrations up to 5%. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 28 Etawa crossbred goats aged 17 months. Goats were randomly assigned to four groups: A negative control, an aqueous fruit peel extract (AFPE) group at 2.5%, another AFPE group at 5%, and a positive control receiving ivermectin. Goats chosen had egg per gram (EPG) counts surpassing 1000 before exposure to Haemonchus contortus. For 7 days within a 9-week study, AFPE from Podang mangoes was given. On the 7th day, the positive control group was administered ivermectin. AFPE dosage relied on the average abomasum fluid per kilogram of animal weight. The feeding regimen consisted of concentrate and Pennisetum purpureum cv. Mott is customized for the nutritional needs of livestock. Data on feed consumption, digestibility, average daily gain, percentage reduction in fecal egg count, body condition score, and clinical parameters were collected throughout the study. RESULTS: At higher treatment levels (AFPE), there was a greater reduction in both EPG and fecal egg counts. The expected and normal ranges were maintained for consumption and digestibility. While body weight increased, FAMACHA parameters showed a decrease. Compared to the negative control group, substantial disparities (p < 0.05) existed for hemoglobin, red blood cells, and hematocrit in both the positive control and the treatment groups. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, indicative of liver and kidney health, were within normal ranges. CONCLUSION: At a concentration of up to 5%, Podang mango waste extract (AFPE) can function as a substitute for traditional helminth medicines or bio-anthelmintics in goats, enhancing their production."

The emission spectra displayed well-defined and prominent peaks that suggested the existence of many fluorophores, such as water content, β-carotene, tartrazine food color, and chlorophyll components. For this study, water and yellow food coloring solution, the two most popular adulterants were added to pure and authenticated mango pulp that had been diluted to an 8% concentration. The fluorophore profile of the samples was ascertained by using multivariate analysis (principal component analysis) in conjunction with fluorescence spectroscopy. The findings showed that the existence of water content is directly correlated with the spectral bands at 444 and 467 nm, and for food color at 580 nm thus the best indicators to detect adulteration of high water contents and food color. Chlorophyll and β-carotene intensities varied among juices, acting as a discriminant marker to distinguish between those with unripened pulp (high chlorophyll intensity) and those with more water and other pigments (lower chlorophyll and β-carotene intensities). With fluorescence emission spectroscopy, qualitative assessment of mango juice can be quickly determined by spectral features, providing details on composition and quality."

This survey was aimed at gathering information regarding the management of thromboembolic prophylaxis within the MITO (Multicenter Italian Trials in Ovarian Cancer)-MaNGO (Mario Negri Gynecologic Oncology) groups. We designed a self-administered, multiple-choice online questionnaire available only for MITO-MaNGO members for one month, starting in May 2022 and ending in June 2022. We processed one response form per center, and 50 responses were analyzed, with most of the respondents (78%) over 40 years old. We found that 82% of them consider thromboembolic prophylaxis in gynecologic oncology to be relevant. In 82% of the centers, a standardized protocol on venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is used, which is applied to both patients undergoing surgery and those undergoing chemotherapy. In the remaining 18% of centers, prophylaxis is used exclusively for patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment. Prophylaxis of patients undergoing surgery and chemotherapy treatment is managed in most cases by the surgeon (72%) and oncologist (76%), respectively. Only 26% of respondents use a thromboembolic risk assessment scale, and of these, those used are the Caprini Score (6%), Khorana Score (6%), and Wells Score (2%). The respondents have good knowledge of low-molecular-weight heparin (90%) and average knowledge of dicumarolics (40%), direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (68%), and antiplatelet agents (40%). The results of our survey indicate that there is a good awareness of thromboembolic prophylaxis in gynecologic oncology. Nevertheless, it is used less in outpatients than in patients undergoing surgery. Moreover, the thromboembolic risk assessment scores are barely used."

METHODS: The HRD analysis was performed on DNA from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor samples of 100 untreated OC patients for which Myriad assay results were available, using TruSight Oncology 500 HRD assay (Illumina), Oncomine Comprehensive Assay Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and SOPHiA DDM HRD solution panel (SOPHiA Genetics). RESULTS: A good overall concordance with the reference method was demonstrated at three different levels: BRCA mutational status (from 94.4 % to 97.7 %), the genomic instability value (from 88.2 % to 95.3 %) and for the HRD status (from 90.4 % to 97.6 %). Moreover, a trend in favour of HRD positive patients for response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival similar to Myriad was observed for all three tests.

Caco-2/HT29-MTX cells were incubated with six extracts of ileal fluid collected pre- and 4-8 h post-mango consumption before being subjected to inflammatory stress. (Poly)phenols in ileal fluids were analysed by UHPLC-HR-MS. Epithelial barrier function was monitored by measurement of trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and the production of selected inflammatory markers (interleukin-8 (IL-8) and nitric oxide (NO)) and the major mucin of the mucosal layer (MUC2). Post-mango intake ileal fluids contained principally benzoic acids, hydroxybenzenes and galloyl derivatives. There was a high interindividual variability in the levels of these compounds, which was reflected by the degree of variability in the protective effects of individual ileal extracts on inflammatory changes in the treated cell cultures. The 24 h treatment with non-cytotoxic doses of extracts of 4-8 h post-mango intake ileal fluid significantly reduced the TEER decrease in monolayers treated with the inflammatory cytomix. This effect was not associated with changes in IL-8 expression and secretion or claudine-7 expression. The mango derived-ileal fluid extract (IFE) also mitigated cytomix-dependent nitrite secretion, as a proxy of NO production, and the MUC2 reduction observed upon the inflammatory challenge. These insights shed light on the potential protective effect of mango (poly)phenols on the intestinal barrier exposed to inflammatory conditions.",

The application of biocontrol agents (BCAs) bears a vast potential for managing the same, which is yet to be exploited to its fullest extent. Hence, studies were conducted for BCAs application of Debaryomyces hansenii, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens strains on mango fruit under in-vitro, in-vivo conditions to know the efficacy of these BCAs on the postharvest pathogen, shelf life and quality retention of mango fruit. The 'poisoned food technique' was attempted for in-vitro studies. For the in-vivo studies, fruit of the commercial cultivar 'Amrapali' were un-inoculated and pre-inoculated with major postharvest pathogens (anthracnose: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and stem-end rot: Botryodiplodia theobromae) were treated with BCA, followed by ambient storage at (24 ± 4 °C, 75 ± 5 % RH). From the results, it has been observed that under in vitro studies, BCA Debaryomyces hansenii (Strain: KP006) and Bacillus subtilis (Strain: BJ0011) at the treatment level 108 CFU mL-1 while, the Pseudomonas fluorescens at 109 CFU mL-1 (Strain: BE0001) were significantly effective for pathogen inhibition. However, under the in vivo studies, the BCA Debaryomyces hansenii (Strain: KP006) at 108 CFU mL-1 treatment level was found to significantly reduce the pathogen's decay incidence while positively influencing the shelf life and biochemical (quality) attributes. This treatment increased the storage life of mango fruit by more than three days over control fruit. Therefore, BCA Debaryomyces hansenii (Strain: KP006) at 108 CFU mL-1 can be used to control the postharvest pathological loss of mango fruit without affecting its internal quality."

      "abstract": "In the textile industry, textile materials are dyed and multi-functionalised by multi-step treatments that considerably increase the environmental impacts by increasing water and energy usage along with increasing the generation of volume of effluent. In this work, Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were in situ formed and stabilised with gallnut, feijoa fruit skin, and mango seed kernel-derived tannins, and wool fabrics were coated simultaneously with these Ag NPs in the same bath. The Ag NP treatment produced dark to light olive-brown shades on wool fabrics. The treatment conditions for the treatment with Ag NPs were optimised to achieve the best results. The colour intensity, UV radiation absorption, antibacterial activity, surface electrical resistance, and durability of the treatment to washing were assessed by various methods. The gallnut-derived tannin (GNT)-stabilised Ag NP-coated wool fabrics showed overall the best results including excellent antibacterial activity against various types of bacteria. The treatment was durable to at least 20 cycles of IWS 7A washes (equivalent to 80 domestic washes). For the 0.5% Ag NPs on the weight of fibre (owf) dosage, the UV light transmission through the trisodium citrate-stabilised Ag NP-coated fabric at 365 and 311 nm was 6.37 and 0.95% respectively, which reduced to 1.63 and 0.20% for the fabric coated with GNT-stabilised Ag NPs providing excellent protection against UV radiation. The surface resistivity of wool fabric reduced from 1.1 × 1012 ohm cm-1 for the untreated fabric to 1.1 × 109 ohm cm-1 for the fabric coated with 2.0% owf GNT-stabilised Ag NPs. The stabilisation of Ag NPs with GNT prolonged the wash-durability by reducing the leaching of Ag NPs from the treated fabric. The developed method could be a sustainable alternative to traditional multi-stage treatments conducted in the textile industry with toxic synthetic dyes and finishing agents for the colouration and multifunctionalisation of wool fabrics."

      "abstract": "Due to the rapid growth of the aquaculture industry, large amounts of organic waste are released into nature and polluted the environment. Traditional organic waste treatment such as composting is a time-consuming process that retains the ammonia (NH3) in the compost, and the compost produced has little economic value as organic fertilizer. Illegal direct discharge into the environment is therefore widespread. This study investigates the recovery of NH3 through thermophilic composting of shrimp aquaculture sludge (SAS) and its application as a soil conditioner for the growth of mango plants. A maximum composting temperature of 57.10 °C was achieved through self-heating in a 200 L bench-scale reactor, resulting in NH3 recovery of 224.04 mol/ton-ds after 14 days. The addition of calcium hydroxide and increased aeration have been shown to increase NH3 volatilization. The recovered NH3 up to 3 kg-N can be used as a source of clean nitrogen for high-value microalgae cultivation, with a theoretical yield of up to 34.85 kg-algae of microalgae biomass from 1 ton-ds of SAS composting. Despite the high salinity, SAS compost improved mango plant growth and disease resistance. These results highlight the potential of SAS compost as a sustainable source of clean nitrogen for microalgae cultivation and soil conditioner, contributing to a waste-free circular economy through nutrient recycling and sustainable agriculture.",

The porous starch samples were obtained using enzymatic treatment and its potential to retain aroma compounds from coffee extract was evaluated. The physicochemical properties, structure characteristics, porosity characteristics and adsorption quantity of starches were also determined. The retention of coffee aroma compounds was investigated through combining starch or porous starch with odorants, and storing the mixtures at room temperature for 7 and 14 days, respectively. The chemical properties of aroma compounds as well as starch surface properties were observed to affect the retention of aroma compounds upon storage. Additionally, 2-furanmethanol, d-limonene and maltol were selected to be the primary target compounds to assess the retention of odorants. This study observed a noticeable decrease in d-limonene content throughout the storage period. On the contrary, after 14 days of storage, the porous starch exhibited high retention of hydroxy compounds including 2-furanmethanol and maltol. However, after prolonged storage their ability to retain 2-furanmethanol and maltol slightly decreased. Therefore, the porous starch derived from mango seeds exhibited the potential to retain coffee aroma compounds and could be a desirable green adsorbent for food and cosmetic industries.",

In this study, 18 COMT genes were identified in the chromosome-level reference genome of mango, named MiCOMTs. A phylogenetic tree containing nine groups (I-IX) was constructed based on the amino acid sequences of the 71 COMT proteins from seven species. The phylogenetic tree indicated that the members of the MiCOMTs could be divided into four groups. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that all MiCOMT genes have particularly high expression levels during flowering. The expression levels of MiCOMTs were different under abiotic and biotic stresses, including salt and stimulated drought stresses, ABA and SA treatment, as well as Xanthomonas campestris pv. mangiferaeindicae and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides infection, respectively. Among them, the expression level of MiCOMT1 was significantly up-regulated at 6-72 h after salt and stimulated drought stresses. The results of gene function analysis via the transient overexpression of the MiCOMT1 gene in Nicotiana benthamiana showed that the MiCOMT1 gene can promote the accumulation of ABA and MeJA, and improve the salt tolerance of mango. These results are beneficial to future researchers aiming to understand the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of MiCOMT genes.",

This study focused on optimizing the production conditions of an enzyme cocktail from Aspergillus niger ATCC 9642 using solid-state fermentation (SSF) and assessing its effectiveness in saccharifying mango peels through a simple, rapid, and efficient one-step process. A rotatable central composite design was employed to determine optimal conditions of moisture, time, and pH for enzyme production in SSF medium. The optimized enzyme cocktail exhibited cellulase activity (CMCase) at 6.28 U/g, filter paper activity (FPase) at 3.29 U/g, and pectinase activity at 117.02 U/g. These optimal activities were achieved with an SSF duration of 81 h, pH of 4.66, and a moisture content of 59%. The optimized enzyme cocktail effectively saccharified the mango peels without the need for chemical agents. The maximum saccharification yield reached approximately 81%, indicating efficient conversion of mango peels into sugars. The enzyme cocktail displayed consistent thermal stability within the tested temperature range of 30-60°C. Notably, the highest sugar release occurred within 36 h, with glucose, arabinose, galactose, and xylose being the primary monosaccharides released during saccharification. This study highlights the potential application of Aspergillus niger ATCC 9642 and SSF for enzymatic production, offering a simple and high-performance process for monosaccharide production. The optimized enzyme cocktail obtained through solid-state fermentation demonstrated efficient saccharification of mango peels, suggesting its suitability for industrial-scale applications.",

Mango juice exposed to UV radiation was also used to determine zero-order and first-order kinetic models of microbial (total plate count, yeast and mold count, and Escherichia coli) reduction. According to the microbiological results, UV light at 120 J/cm2 caused a 5.19 log reduction. It was found that microbial inactivation of all tested microorganisms followed first-order kinetic model. The treatments did not differ significantly in terms of the quality metrics. L*, b*, pH, total soluble solid, total phenolic compound, total flavonoid content, and antioxidant activity as measured by the DPPH and FRAP assay all tended to decline during storage at 4 °C, whereas a*, ∆E, titratable acidity, total plate count, yeast and mold count, as well as the total plate count, had an increasing trend. During storage at 4 °C, UV irradiation increased the shelf life of mango juice by about 14 days compared to the control sample. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the potential of UV treatment as an alternative to thermal pasteurization for preserving mango juice quality and safety while also prolonging shelf life.",

In this work, a novel ethylene scavenger was prepared from amorphous silica-alumina derived from sugar cane bagasse ash (SC-ASA) and used to prolong the shelf life of mango fruits during storage. KMnO4 at 2, 4, or 6 wt %/w was loaded on SC-ASA using an impregnation method. The results showed that 4% w/w KMnO4 loaded on SC-ASA (4KM/SC-ASA) was superior for ethylene removal at an initial ethylene concentration of 400 μL L-1 for 120 min under ambient conditions (25-27 °C and 70-75% relative humidity), resulting in 100% ethylene removal. The kinetic study of ethylene removal showed that the adsorption data were best fitted with a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The effects of 4KM/SC-ASA as sachets on the quality changes of the mango fruits were investigated, with the results showing that mango fruits packed in cardboard boxes with 4KM/SC-ASA had significantly delayed ripening, low levels of ethylene production, respiration, and weight loss, high fruit firmness, low total soluble solids, and high acidity compared to those of the control treatment. These findings should contribute to developing an ethylene scavenger to extend the shelf life of fruits, reduce the waste of the sugar and ethanol industries, and make it a valuable material."

The synthesized material was characterized and applied in chloroquine (CQN) and sertraline hydrochloride (SER) removal from contaminated waters. The biosorbent was subjected to a regenerative study and treatment using a synthetic mixture of contaminants to evaluate its applicability in real effluents. The biosorbent was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy images, scanning electron microscopy, dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectra, and zeta potential to characterize its chemical and morphology properties. The techniques applied showed the effectiveness of the proposed modification. In the adsorption experiments, the optimal adsorbent dosage was 0.01 g for both contaminants. The pH strongly influenced the adsorption of the drugs on MS-Fe3O4, and the best results were obtained in the pH range of 5-6. Kinetic data showed a better fit to the pseudo-second-order model, and the equilibrium time was achieved in 16 h for CQN and 4 h for SER. Isotherm studies revealed maximum adsorptive capacities of 49.42 and 64.79 mg g-1, respectively, for CQN and SER, at 318 K, demonstrating that the increase in temperature is a favorable factor, and the Sips model better describes the process. The thermodynamic parameters indicate an endothermic (ΔH° >0), spontaneous (ΔG° <0), and reversible (ΔS° >0) nature of the adsorption. This process is essentially governed by physical forces, such as hydrogen and π-π bonds. However, it is also valid to consider the presence of electrostatic forces due to the ionizing nature of CQN and SER. The MS-Fe3O4 biosorbent showed good performance when evaluated in a synthetic mixture of four contaminants, with an overall removal efficiency of approximately 86% and the regenerative capacity of three reusing cycles.",

Mango seeds were graphitized at different temperatures (800 °C, 900 °C, 1000 °C, and 1100 °C) and their effectiveness as anodes was evaluated. Surface morphology analysis indicated that the proposed anode was characterized by layered branches and micro-sized deep holes, facilitating enhanced biofilm formation and microorganism attachment. Maximum power densities achieved in the MFCs utilizing the mango seed-packed anodes graphitized at 1100 °C and 1000 °C were 2170.8 ± 90 and 1350.6 ± 125 mW m-2, respectively. Furthermore, the weight of the graphitized seed anode demonstrated a positive correlation with the generated power density and cell potential. Specifically, MFCs fabricated with 9 g and 6 g anodes achieved maximum power densities of 2170.8 ± 90 and 1800.5 ± 40 mW m-2, respectively. A continuous mode air cathode MFC employing the proposed graphitized mango anode prepared at 1100 °C and operated at a flow rate of 2 L h-1 generated a stable current density of approximately 12 A m-2 after 15 hours of operation, maintaining its stability for 75 hours. Furthermore, a chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of 85% was achieved in an assembled continuous mode MFC. Considering that the proposed MFC was driven by sewage wastewater without the addition of external microorganisms, atmospheric oxygen was used as the electron acceptor through an air cathode mode, agricultural biomass waste was employed for the preparation of the anode, and a higher power density was achieved (2170.8 mW m-2) compared to reported values; it is evident that the proposed graphitized mango seed anode exhibits high efficiency for application in MFCs."

The results indicate that a 0.01% morin application effectively delayed fruit softening and yellowing and sustained the nutritional quality. After 12 days of storage, the contents of soluble sugar and carotenoid in the treatment groups were 68.54 mg/g and 11.20 mg/100 g, respectively, lower than those in control, while the vitamin C content in the treatment groups was 0.58 mg/g, higher than that in control. Moreover, a morin application successively enhanced the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD), but reduced the activity of polygalacturonase (PG) and pectin lyase (PL). Finally, real-time PCR and correlation analysis suggested that morin downregulated the ethylene biosynthesis (ACS and, ACO) and signal transduction (ETR1, ERS1, EIN2, and ERF1) genes, which is positively associated with softening enzymes (LOX, EXP, βGal, and EG), carotenoid synthesis enzymes (PSY and, LCYB), sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), and uncoupling protein (UCP) gene expressions. Therefore, a 0.01% morin treatment might efficiently retard mango fruit ripening and senescence to sustain external and nutritional quality through ethylene-related pathways, which indicates its preservation application."

The main compound found in oregano was carvacrol (69.1%); in rosemary and pepper oil, it was thymol (77.2%); cinnamaldehyde (85.1%) was the main constituent of cinnamon bark, and the eugenol (84.84%) in cloves. When evaluating the antifungal activity of these compounds, thymol and carvacrol showed greater inhibitory activity against fungi. Therefore, this study showed the great potential of oregano, clove, rosemary pepper, and cinnamon bark essential oil as alternative treatments to synthetic fungicides in controlling postharvest diseases in mangoes.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Irvingia gabonensis (Aubry-Lecomte ex O'Rorke) Baill., also known as \"African mango\" or \"bush mango\", belonging to family Irvingiaceae, has been mostly used as food and traditional medicine for weight loss and to enhance the health. AIM OF THE STUDY: The overconsumption of high-fat and high-carbohydrate (HFHC) food induces oxidative stress, leading to neurological and cognitive dysfunction. Consequently, there is an immediate need for effective treatment. Hence, this study explored the efficacy of orlistat, metformin, and I. gabonensis seeds' total aqueous extract (IG SAE) in addressing HFHC-induced cognitive impairment by mitigating oxidative stress and their underlying mechanistic pathways. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Initially, the secondary metabolite profile of IG SAE is determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a mass detector (UHPLC/MS). The in vivo study involves two phases: an established model phase with control (10 rats on a standard diet) and HFHC diet group (50 rats) for 3 months. In the study phase, HFHC is divided into 5 groups. The first subgroup receives HFHC diet only, while the remaining groups each receive HFHC diet with either Orlistat, metformin, or IG SAE at doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, respectively, for 28 days. RESULTS: More than 150 phytoconstituents were characterized for the first holistic approach onto IG metabolome. Characterization of IG SAE revealed that tannins dominate metabolites in the plant. Total phenolics and flavonoids were estimated to standardize our extract (77.12 ± 7.09 μg Gallic acid equivalent/mg extract and 8.039 ± 0.53 μg Rutin equivalent/mg extract, respectively). Orlistat, metformin, and IG SAE successfully reduced the body weight, blood glucose level, lipid profile, oxidative stress and neurotransmitters levels leading to improved behavioral functions as well as histological alternation. Also, IG SAE halted inflammation, apoptosis, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, together with promoting autophagy, via modulation of PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β/CREB, PERK/CHOP/Bcl-2 and AMPK/SIRT-1/m-TOR pathways. CONCLUSION: Metformin, orlistat, and IG SAE offer a promising multi-target therapy to mitigate HFHC diet-induced oxidative stress, addressing cognitive function. This involves diverse molecular mechanisms, particularly the modulation of inflammation, ER stress, and both PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β/CREB and AMPK/SIRT-1/m-TOR pathways. Furthermore, the higher dose of IG SAE demonstrated effects comparable to orlistat and metformin across most studied parameters.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive type of brain cancer, with a 5-year survival rate of ~5% and most tumours recurring locally within months of first-line treatment. Hypoxia is associated with worse clinical outcomes in GBM, as it leads to localized resistance to radiotherapy and subsequent tumour recurrence. Current standard of care treatment does not account for tumour hypoxia, due to the challenges of mapping tumour hypoxia in routine clinical practice. In this clinical study, we aim to investigate the role of oxygen enhanced (OE) and blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) MRI as non-invasive imaging biomarkers of hypoxia in GBM, and to evaluate their potential role in dose-painting radiotherapy planning and treatment response assessment. METHODS: The primary endpoint is to evaluate the quantitative and spatial correlation between OE and BOLD MRI measurements and [18F]MISO values of uptake in the tumour. The secondary endpoints are to evaluate the repeatability of MRI biomarkers of hypoxia in a test-retest study, to estimate the potential clinical benefits of using MRI biomarkers of hypoxia to guide dose-painting radiotherapy, and to evaluate the ability of MRI biomarkers of hypoxia to assess treatment response. Twenty newly diagnosed GBM patients will be enrolled in this study. Patients will undergo standard of care treatment while receiving additional OE/BOLD MRI and [18F]MISO PET scans at several timepoints during treatment. The ability of OE/BOLD MRI to map hypoxic tumour regions will be evaluated by assessing spatial and quantitative correlations with areas of hypoxic tumour identified via [18F]MISO PET imaging. DISCUSSION: MANGO (Magnetic resonance imaging of hypoxia for radiation treatment guidance in glioblastoma multiforme) is a diagnostic/prognostic study investigating the role of imaging biomarkers of hypoxia in GBM management. The study will generate a large amount of longitudinal multimodal MRI and PET imaging data that could be used to unveil dynamic changes in tumour physiology that currently limit treatment efficacy, thereby providing a means to develop more effective and personalised treatments."

The present study's goal is to appraise the chemo preventive possessions of MF on azoxymethane (AOM)-mediated colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in rats. Rats clustered into 5 groups, negative control (A), inoculated subcutaneously with normal saline twice and nourished on 0.5% CMC; groups B-E injected twice with 15 mg/kg azoxymethane followed by ingestion of 0.5% CMC (B, cancer control); intraperitoneal inoculation of 35 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil (C, reference rats) or nourished on 30 mg/kg (D) and 60 mg/kg (E) of MF. Results of gross morphology of colorectal specimens showed significantly lower total colonic ACF incidence in MF-treated rats than that of cancer controls. The colon tissue examination of cancer control rats showed increased ACF availability with bizarrely elongated nuclei, stratified cells, and higher depletion of the submucosal glands compared to MF-treated rats. Mangiferin treatment caused increased regulation of pro-apoptotic (increased Bax) proteins and reduced the β-catenin) proteins expression. Moreover, rats fed on MF had significantly higher glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and lower malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in their colonic tissue homogenates. Mangiferin supplementation significantly down-shifted pro-inflammatory cytokines (transforming growth factor-α and interleukine-6) and up-shifted anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukine-10) based on serum analysis. The chemo-protective mechanistic of MF against AOM-induced ACF, shown by lower ACF values and colon tissue penetration, could be correlated with its positive modulation of apoptotic cascade, antioxidant enzymes, and inflammatory cytokines originating from AOM oxidative stress insults.",

Its processing generates huge quantities of mango byproducts, which is often discarded unscrupulously into the environment and, therefore, needs effective waste management practices. The extraction of mango peels' dietary fiber using enzymatic method can be a useful valorization strategy for management of mango by-products. In the present investigation, dietary fiber (soluble and insoluble fraction) was extracted by enzymatic hydrolysis using α-amylase, protease, and amyloglucosidase. Highest yield of dietary fiber (67.5%, w/w) was obtained at 60 °C temperature using recommended enzyme concentrations including α-amylase (40 µL), protease (110 µL), and amyloglucosidase (200 µL) after a treatment time of 60 min. SEM analysis indicated the increased porosity of dietary fiber samples caused due to the hydrolytic effect of enzymes on its surface structure, whereas FTIR analysis confirmed the functional groups present in dietary fiber. The coexistence of crystalline and amorphous nature of polymers present in soluble and insoluble fractions of dietary fiber was assessed by XRD analysis. Further, the analysis of functional properties including WHC, OHC, and SC revealed the suitability of using extracted mango peel's dietary fiber in the food systems.",

The entire plant, including the leaves, fruit, roots, and flowers, has various therapeutic characteristics used for centuries to cure various illnesses. This systematic review aimed to identify an inexpensive, simple, and effective method of preventing and controlling dental caries. The search was performed among the studies written in English, the database of abstracts concentrating on the effects of Mangifera indica (Mango) on dental caries detected in Pubmed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Central. In total, we find 37 articles. The relevant English language articles published up to August 2022 were collected, screened, and reviewed. Search words contained \"Mangifera indica\" and \"dental caries\" or \"Streptococcus mutans\" or \"tooth demineralization.\" For our systematic review analysis, we included 3 randomized controlled trial studies studying a total of 130 people, of whom 110 were children aged 8 to 14 and 20 were adults aged 20 to 25. These experiments all employed mouthwash containing an extract from Mangifera indica. In conclusion, it has been proven in 2 separate studies that saliva's PH will increase significantly. In addition, a reduction of S. mutants has been observed in another research. Overall, it was concluded that mango extract mouthwash is highly effective in decreasing the bacteria that can cause dental caries. however, we firmly believe that conduction of more detailed in vivo studies regarding Mangifera indica implications in dental caries treatment is essentially needed for further confirmation."

      "abstract": "Mango is a climacteric fruit that ripens quickly after harvest due to its climacteric nature. Edible coatings have been reported to delay the ripening of various harvested fruit. The efficacy of the applied edible coatings could be improved by using in combination as a layer-by-layer (LBL) approach. So, the influence of LBL application of chitosan (CH) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was studied on mangoes during postharvest storage at 15 °C for 20 days. Mangoes were coated with monolayers of CH (1 % w/v) and CMC (1 % w/v) as well as LBL application of CH and CMC and were compared with control. The treatment of mangoes with CH and CMC-based LBL treatment resulted in lower decay percentage and weight loss along with higher total chlorophyll pigments and suppressed total carotenoid accumulation. The LBL application of CH and CMC showed lower activity of chlorophyll degrading such as chlorophyllase (CPS), pheophytinase (Phe), Mg-dechalatase (MGD) and chlorophyll degrading peroxidase (Chl-POD) enzymes as well as reduced changes in b*, a* and L* along with a suppressed increase in ethylene (EP) and CO2 production (CPR) rates having higher antioxidant such as catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes activity. In addition, mangoes coated with LBL treatment of CH and CMC exhibited lower water-soluble pectin (WSP) and higher protopectin (PP) having higher concentrations of chelate soluble (CSP) and sodium carbonate-soluble pectin (SCP). Similarly, LBL-coated mangoes showed significantly higher hemicellulose (HCLS) and cellulose (CLS) contents in contrast with control. It was observed that mangoes coated with CH and CMC-based LBL coating exhibited higher flesh firmness and showed suppressed cellulase (CS), pectin methylesterase (PME), polygalacturonase (PG) and β-galactosidase (β-Gal) enzymes activity. The concentrations of total soluble solids and ripening index were markedly lower and titratable acidity was higher in the LBL-based coating treatment in comparison with control. In conclusion, LBL treatment based on CH and CMC coatings could be used for the delay of ripening and softening of harvested mangoes.",

      "abstract": "Mango fruit tend to oxidize and senescence rapidly after harvesting, significantly reducing their commercial value. This study investigated the effect of exogenous auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) on fruit quality, antioxidant system, and cell wall metabolism of mango fruit during storage. The results showed that the 1.0 mM IAA treatment delayed weight loss and maintained the firmness, pH and contents of total soluble solids (TSS) and titratable acidity (TA) of the mango fruit. The 1.0 mM IAA treatment increased the peroxidase (POD) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activities and the ascorbic acid (AsA) and total phenols (TP) contents but decreased the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity in postharvest mango fruit. Moreover, beta-galactosidase (β-Gal) and polygalacturonase (PG) activities were increased, but the pectinesterase (PME) activity was decreased in the IAA-treated fruit. Transcriptome analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the IAA vs. control groups were mainly associated with oxidative stress responses, cell wall metabolism, and transcription factors (TFs). The IAA treatment upregulated the antioxidant-related genes (SOD, CAT1, PODs, GSTs, Prxs, and Trxs) and MYB TFs, and downregulated cell wall metabolism-related genes (PG, PME31 and two PME63) and 11 ethylene-responsive transcription factors (ERFs). These results suggested that exogenous IAA could improve the antioxidant system and maintain the storage quality of mango fruit by regulating gene expression and metabolic pathways. The results provide insights into the mechanisms involved in IAA-mediated delayed ripening and senescence of mango fruit.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the anti-hyperglycemic action of mango seed kernel extract (MKE) and various mechanisms involved in its actions to improve pancreatic β cells and hepatic carbohydrate metabolism in diabetic rats. An intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg of streptozotocin (STZ) followed by 30 consecutive days of treatment with MKE (250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg body weight) was used to establish a study group of diabetic rats. Using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS) for identification, 26 chemical compounds were found in MKE and the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the MKE also revealed the existence of mangiferin, gallic acid, and quercetin. The results confirmed that in each diabetes-affected rat, MKE mitigated the heightened levels of fasting blood glucose, diabetic symptoms, glucose intolerance, total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). As demonstrated by a remarkable increment in serum and pancreatic insulin, the diabetic pancreatic β cell function was potentiated by treating with MKE. The effect of MKE on diabetic pancreatic apoptosis clearly reduced the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells, which was related to diminished levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Bax and an increase in Bcl-xL protein expression. Furthermore, diabetes-induced liver damage was clearly ameliorated along with a notable reduction in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and abnormal liver histology. By enhancing anti-oxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, MKE alleviated diabetes-induced pancreatic and liver oxidative damage, as demonstrated by diminished levels of malondialdehyde. In minimizing the expression levels of glucose 6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-1 proteins in the diabetic liver, MKE also enhanced glycogen content and hexokinase activity. Collectively, these findings indicate that by suppressing oxidative and inflammatory processes, MKE exerts a potent anti-hyperglycemic activity in diabetic rats which serve to protect pancreatic β cell apoptosis, enhance their function, and improve hepatic glucose metabolism.",

A small bowel resection and primary anastomosis was performed and the patient had an uncomplicated post-operative course. Meckel's diverticuli are a relatively common phenomenon and may pre-dispose to bowel obstructions through a number of different mechanisms.

Autotetraploid leaves displayed lower Ψl and Gs in both treatments, but the lack of irrigation only affected Gs. Foliar cells of the adaxial epidermis and the spongy mesophyll contained linear pectin epitopes, whereas branched pectins were localized in the abaxial epidermis, the chloroplast membrane, and the sieve tube elements of the phloem. Cell and fruit organ size was larger in autotetraploid than in diploid mango trees, but the sugar content in the fruits was similar between both cytotypes. Specific cell wall hygroscopic pectins correlate with more stable Ψl of autotetraploid leaves under soil water shortage, keeping lower Gs compared with diploids. These preliminary results point to diploids as more susceptible to water deficits than tetraploids."

      "abstract": "Alum and ferric salts as traditional chemical coagulants for turbidity removal in water and wastewater are expensive, and have known harmful effects. Thus, attempts to replace the chemical coagulants with safe and effective natural solutions are increasingly being made in terms of research studies to investigate the coagulation efficacies of various plants one of which is Mango (Mangifera indica). It is worth noting that M. indica has various genotypes of different origins across the world. In this study, eight (8) common M. indica genotypes in Uganda were identified, protein contents of their seed kernels determined, and coagulating efficacies investigated. Coagulation solution of each selected genotype was obtained by dissolving 5 g powder of the selected Mango seed kernel sample in 100 mL of distilled water. Next, 5 mL of this coagulant (or stock) solution was used to treat 200 mL of turbid water with turbidity ranging from 15 to 120 NTU. Using 0.01 M hydrochloric acid as an extraction solvent, protein contents of selected genotypes including Apple mango, Kate, Kent, Bire, Doodo red, Takataka, Kagoogwa, and Tommy Atkins were 38.02 %, 30.66 %, 15.94 %, 22.11 %, 21.50 %, 16.98 %, 16.36 %, and 17.87 %, respectively. Efficacies of coagulant from Apple mango, Kate, Kent, Bire, Doodo red, Takataka, Kagoogwa, and Tommy Atkins seed kernel samples were 92.2, 89.3, 66.0, 78.7, 76.9, 71.1, 68.9, and 73.1 %, respectively. Apple mango was the best performing genotype as a coagulant and this was followed by Kate. Coagulation efficacy was generally found to increase with increasing turbidity and/or coagulant's concentration. For instance, Apple Mango coagulant removed 16.7 %, 50.3 %, and 92.2 % of initial turbidity 15, 65 and 120 NTU, respectively. Kent removed 57.5, 66, and 69 % of initial turbidity 120 NTU using 5, 20, and 30 mL of stock solution, respectively. This study demonstrated the influence of the choice of a plant genotype on coagulation efficacy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare and investigate the effects of 1-(3-phenyl-propyl) cyclopropene (PPCP) and melatonin (MT) as anti-ethylene agents on postharvest senescence, quality, chilling tolerance, and antioxidant metabolism in the mango fruit cv. \"Keitt\". The study involved exposing the fruit to 20 μL L- 1 PPCP or 200 μM MT, in addition to a control group of untreated fruit, before storing them at 5 ± 1 °C for 28 d. The findings revealed that the treatments with PPCP and MT were effective in reducing chilling injury and preserving fruit quality when compared to the control group. RESULTS: The use of 20 μL L- 1 PPCP was an effective treatment in terms of mitigating chilling injury and preserving fruit quality for 28 d. This was attributed to the decrease in metabolic activity, specifically the respiration rate and the production of ethylene, which led to the maintenance of fruit firmness and bioactive compounds, energy metabolism, and antioxidant activity, such as ascorbic acid, total flavonoids, trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, dehydroascorbate reductase, glutathione reductase activity, ATP, and ATPase activity. The study also found that the MT treatment at 200 μM was effective in reducing chilling injury and weight loss and improving membrane stability. Additionally, it led to a decrease in malondialdehyde content and electrolyte leakage, and the maintenance of fruit quality in terms of firmness, peel and pulp colour values for mango peel and pulp total carotenoid content, as well as phenylalanine ammonia lyase and tyrosine ammonia lyase activity. These findings indicate that PPCP and MT have the potential to be efficient treatments in maintaining mango quality and minimizing post-harvest losses. CONCLUSION: The utilisation of treatments with 20 μL L- 1 of PPCP or 200 μM MT was found to effectively preserve the postharvest quality parameters, in terms of bioactive compounds, energy metabolism, and antioxidant activity, of mangoes cv. \"Keitt\" that were stored at 5 ± 1 °C for 28 d.",

The obtained results were compared with mean fruit fly population values from two previous years without the combined use of both techniques. The treatments were: SIT + ABC, SIT, ABC, and Control, and each treatment was established in blocks of 5000 Ha separated by distances of 5-10 km. The evaluations were carried out through fruit sampling to assess percent parasitism and trapping of adult flies to obtain Flies per Trap per Day (FTD) values. The mean percentage of parasitism increased from 0.59% in the control treatment to 19.38% in the block with ABC. The FTD values decreased from ~0.129 and ~0.012 in the control block to 0.0021 in the block with SIT and ABC, representing a 98% suppression. The difference between the two periods in the control block was not significant. We conclude that the integration of both techniques resulted in an additive suppression of the pest population, supporting the use of both control techniques in an area-wide pest management context."

      "abstract": "Anthracnose decay caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides greatly shortens the shelf life and commercial quality of mango fruit. Putrescine (1,4-Diaminobutane) is involved in modulating plant defense to various environmental stresses. In this research, in vivo and in vitro tests were used to explore the antifungal activity and the underlying mechanism of putrescine against C. gloeosporioides in mango fruit after harvested. In vivo tests suggested that putrescine markedly delayed the occurrence of disease and limited the spots expansion on inoculated mango fruit. Further analysis exhibited that putrescine treatment enhanced disease resistance, along with enhanced activities of chitinase (CHI), β-1,3-glucanase (GLU), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), 4-coumarate coenzyme A ligase (4CL), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and the accumulation of lignin, flavonoid, phenolics, and anthocyanin in infected mango fruit. In addition, in vitro tests showed that putrescine exerted strongly antifungal activity against C. gloeosporioides. Putrescine induced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and severe lipid peroxidation damage in C. gloeosporioides mycelia, resulting in the leakage of soluble protein, soluble sugar, nucleic acids, K+ and Ca2+ of C. gloeosporioides mycelia. The mycelium treated with putrescine showed severe deformity and shrinkage, and even cracking. Taken together, putrescine could effectively reduce the incidence rate and severity of anthracnose disease possibly through direct fungicidal effect and indirect induced resistance mechanism, thus showing great potential to be applied to disease control.",

The effects of CuO NPs on the morphological, mechanical, thermal, physical and antifungal properties of the CS films and postharvest quality of mango fruit were determined. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis confirmed that CuO NPs were uniformly dispersed into the CS matrix. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) profiles showed that intermolecular H-bondings occurred between CS and CuO NPs, accompanied by decreased crystallinity and increased amorphous structure. In comparison to the pure CS film, addition of CuO NPs obviously improved the morphological, mechanical, thermal, physical and antifungal properties of CSC film. CSC coating treatment obviously delayed the fruit decay and yellowing, as well as reduced losses of weight and firmness of mango (Mangifera indica L.) fruit during the storage, when compared with the control and CS coating treatment. Meanwhile, it significantly decreased the respiration rate and ethylene generation and maintained high level of ascorbic acid (AsA), titratable acid (TA) and soluble sugar content (SSC) of the fruit during the storage. Notably, Cu presented in the CSC film was restrained to the peel, indicating that the CSC coated mango fruit had good edible safety. Principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed that CSC coating played a positive role in mango preservation. Therefore, CSC coating can be considered a potential application for successfully controlling of postharvest disease and prolonging the shelf life for mango fruit.",

METHODS: The mango fruit (Mangifera indica L.cv. Guixiang) was treated with 0 (control), 2, 5, and 8 mM of reduced glutathione (GSH) after harvest. The fruit was stored at 25 ± 1 °C for 12 days to observe the changes in the antioxidant capacity and postharvest quality. RESULTS: Compared with the control, the 5 mM GSH treatment significantly decreased the weight loss by 44.0% and 24.4%, total soluble solids content by 25.1% and 4.5%, and soluble sugar content by 19.0% and 27.0%. Conversely, the 5 mM GSH treatment increased the firmness by 25.9% and 30.7% on days 4 and 8, respectively, and the titratable acidity content by 115.1% on day 8. Additionally, the 5 mM GSH treatment decreased the malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide contents and improved the antioxidant capacity of mango fruit by increasing the superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activities and upregulating the expression of the encoding genes. Meanwhile, the higher levels of monodehydroascorbate reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase, and glutathione reductase enzyme activities and gene expressions accelerated the AsA-GSH cycle, thereby increasing the accumulation of AsA and GSH and maintaining the redox balance. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the experimental results suggest that 5 mM GSH maintains high antioxidant capacity and postharvest quality of mangoes and can use as an effective preservation technique for postharvest mangoes.",

      "abstract": "The growing demand for cellulosic pulp presents an opportunity to explore alternatives to this material, focusing on utilizing agro-industrial residues. Mango's tegument is a rich source of cellulose, making it a valuable raw material for manufacturing single-use articles or blends with biopolymers. In this sense, employing conventional alkaline and acid chemical treatments, the mango's tegument was treated to obtain cellulosic pulp. The teguments were subjected to treatment with alkaline solutions (2% and 4% NaOH w/v) at 80 °C for 1 or 2 h or with an acetic acid solution (1:1 or 1:2 CH3COOH:H2O2) at 60-70 °C for 1 or 2 h. After treatment, an evaluation was conducted to assess the yield, color, chemical analysis, and structural, thermal, and morphological properties. The alkali treatments produced cellulosic pulps with a light color with 37-42% yield and reduced hemicellulose content. The acid treatments produced orange-brown cellulosic pulp with 47-48% yield and higher hemicellulose content. The acid pulps were thermally more stable (maximum decomposition at 348-357 °C) than the alkali pulps (maximum decomposition at 316-321 °C). The crystallinity index demonstrated that both treatments increased the crystallinity of the cellulose pulps compared with the untreated tegument. The thermal stability of cellulosic pulp at the processing temperatures of disposable tableware (50-120 °C) revealed that plates, bowls, trays, and cups could be produced. Another potential application is as a component of blends with biopolymers to make straws or rigid food packaging (trays) with reinforced structures."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the influences of a dipping/coating composed of calcium chloride (CaCl2 ) or chitosan on the quality of ripe mango pieces during frozen storage for 6 months. The fruits were dipped in solutions with concentrations of 0.5% and 1% for different times (15 or 30 min for CaCl2 and 1 or 15 min for chitosan). We found that treatment with 1% CaCl2 for 30 min significantly retarded the color changes with the highest L* (p < 0.05) and the lowest of b* and ∆E (p ≥ 0.05). Interestingly, treatment with 0.5% CaCl2 for 30 min significantly preserved the contents of total phenolics and total flavonoids and the antioxidant activities at values higher than the control levels, as determined by DPPH and ABTS assays (p < 0.05). Moreover, treatment with 0.5%-1% chitosan for 1 min effectively delayed the loss of moisture and weight. The results indicate that dipping in CaCl2 is an alternative simple food processing technique for improving the quality of ripe mango pieces during frozen storage that effectively delays the color changes and preserves the antioxidant content and activity. HIGHLIGHTS: The coating of frozen ripe mango pieces with CaCl2 and chitosan was first investigated. CaCl2 effectively retarded the color change during storage and after thawing. Chitosan effectively delayed the loss of moisture and weight of mango pulp. Coating with 0.5% CaCl2 for 30 min maintained the phytochemicals and antioxidant activities. Coating treatment can preserve mango qualities and could be commercialized with cost savings. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The present article proposes a strategy that effectively delays the physicochemical changes and preserves the nutritional properties of mango fruit and could be commercialized with cost savings. A frozen mango can either be consumed (ready-to-eat frozen mango) or used as a food raw material.",

This study evaluated the storage behavior of two mango cultivars and their response to exogenous melatonin (MT, 1000 μmol L-1) treatment in attenuating fruit decay and enhancing fruits' physiological and metabolic processes and gene relative expression subjected to cold storage. MT treatment in both mango cultivars significantly delayed weight loss, firmness, respiration rate, and decay incidence. However, MT did not influence the TSS, TA, and TSS:TA ratio regardless of the cultivar. Moreover, MT inhibited the decrease in total phenol and flavonoid content and AsA content while delaying the increase in the MDA content of mango during storage in both cultivars. In addition, MT dramatically inhibited the enzyme activity of PPO. In contrast, an increase in the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and APX) and PAL and their genes' relative expression was noticed in MT-treated fruits versus control in both cultivars. However, MT treatment was cultivar dependent in most parameters under study. These results demonstrated that MT treatment could be an essential postharvest treatment in minimizing decay, maintaining fruit quality, and extending mango fruits' postharvest shelf life by enhancing the physiological and metabolic processes during cold storage."

Conventional chemical fungicides and plastic prevent fungal diseases but they are hazardous to humans and the environment. Direct application of essential oil for post-harvest fruit control is not a cost-effective approach. The current work offers an eco-friendly alternative to controlling the post-harvest disease of fruit using a film amalgamated with oil derived from Melaleuca alternifolia. Further, this research also aimed to assess the mechanical, antioxidant, and antifungal properties of the film infused with essential oil. ASTM D882 was performed to determine the tensile strength of the film. The antioxidant reaction of the film was assessed using the DPPH assay. In vitro and in vivo tests were used to evaluate the inhibitory development of the film against pathogenic fungi, by comparing the film with different levels of essential oil together with the treatment of the control and chemical fungicide. Disk diffusion was used to evaluate mycelial growth inhibition, where the film incorporated with 1.2 wt% essential oil yielded the best results. For in vivo testing of wounded mango, the disease incidence was successfully reduced. For in vivo testing of unwounded mango to which the film incorporated with essential oil was applied, although some quality parameters such as the color index were not significantly affected, weight loss was reduced, soluble solid content was increased, and firmness was increased, compared to the control. Thus, the film incorporated with essential oil (EO) from M. alternifolia can be an environmentally friendly alternative to the conventional approach and the direct application of essential oil to control post-harvest disease in mango."

The mango fruit was then stored for 10 days at 25 °C and 85-90% relative humidity. Quality characteristics and the active oxygen metabolism of postharvest mangoes were evaluated every 2 days. Compared to untreated mango fruit, those with the treatments of 1-MCP alone or 1-MCP + MT had a better appearance and higher levels of soluble sugar, ascorbic acid, and titratable acidity. Moreover, these treatments prevented the loss of fruit firmness, successfully delayed the escalation of a* and b* values, and reduced malondialdehyde content and superoxide anion generation rate. After 10 days of storage, mango fruit treated by 1-MCP alone or 1-MCP + MT exhibited increased activities of antioxidant enzymes such as ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and other peroxidases; nevertheless, the two treatment protocols maintained higher mango total phenolic content only at the later stage of storage. These findings suggest that mango fruit treated with 1-MCP alone or with 1-MCP + MT improves the quality characteristics and antioxidant activities. Moreover, compared to 1-MCP treatment alone, 1-MCP + MT-treated mangoes exhibited higher quality and a stronger regulation of active metabolism during storage."

      "abstract": "Obesity is a condition caused by surplus adipose tissue and is a risk factor for several diet-related diseases. Obesity is a global epidemic that has also been challenging to treat effectively. However, one promoted therapy to safely treat obesity is anti-adipogenic therapeutics. Therefore, identifying potent anti-adipogenic bioactive compounds that can safely be used clinically may effectively treat obesity in humans. Mango leaf has potential medicinal properties due to its many bioactive compounds that may enhance human health. Mangiferin (MGF) is a primary constituent in mango plants, with many health-promoting qualities. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of MGF, and tea brewed with mango leaves in cultured adipocytes. The anti-adipogenic efficacy of mango leaf tea (MLT) and MGF in 3T3-L1 cells were assessed, along with cell viability, triglyceride levels, adiponectin secretion, and glucose uptake analyzed. In addition, changes in the mRNA expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism within 3T3-L1 cells were determined using quantitative real-time PCR. Our results showed while both MLT and MGF increased glucose uptake in adipocytes, only MLT appeared to inhibit adipogenesis, as determined by decreased triglyceride accumulation. We also observed increased secretory adiponectin levels, reduced ACC mRNA expression, and increased FOXO1 and ATGL gene expression in 3T3-L1 cells treated with MLT but not MGF. Together, these results suggest that MLT may exhibit anti-adipogenic properties independent of MGF content."

      "abstract": "Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) represent an emerging class of contaminants. With a potential to negatively impact human health and the ecosystem, existence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic systems is becoming a worrying concern. Antibiotics is a major class of PhACs and their existence in wastewater signifies a health risk on the long run. With the purpose of competently removing antibiotics from wastewater, cost-effective, and copiously available waste-derived adsorbents were structured. In this study, mango seeds kernel (MSK), both as a pristine biochar (Py-MSK) and as a nano-ceria-laden (Ce-Py-MSK) were applied for the remediation of rifampicin (RIFM) and tigecycline (TIGC). To save time and resources, adsorption experiments were managed using a multivariate-based scheme executing the fractional factorial design (FrFD). Percentage removal (%R) of both antibiotics was exploited in terms of four variables: pH, adsorbent dosage, initial drug concentration, and contact time. Preliminary experiments showed that Ce-Py-MSK has higher adsorption efficiency for both RIFM and TIGC compared to Py-MSK. The %R was 92.36% for RIFM compared to 90.13% for TIGC. With the purpose of comprehending the adsorption process, structural elucidation of both sorbents was performed using FT-IR, SEM, TEM, EDX, and XRD analyses which confirmed the decoration of the adsorbent surface with the nano-ceria. BET analysis revealed that Ce-Py-MSK has a higher surface area (33.83 m2/g) contrasted to the Py-MSK (24.72 m2/g). Isotherm parameters revealed that Freundlich model best fit Ce-Py-MSK-drug interactions. A maximum adsorption capacity (qm) of 102.25 and 49.28 mg/g was attained for RIFM and TIGC, respectively. Adsorption kinetics for both drugs conformed well with both pseudo-second order (PSO) and Elovich models. This study, therefore, has established the suitability of Ce-Py-MSK as a green, sustainable, cost-effective, selective, and efficient adsorbent for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater."

      "abstract": "Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is one of the most popular tropical fruits grown in Egypt and several other countries, making it a potential export commodity. Excessive deterioration after harvest requires various treatments to maintain fruit quality. We evaluated the treatments effects of melatonin (MT) as an anti-ethylene agent and tragacanth gum (TRG) as an edible coating individually and together (MT-TRG) before storing mangoes at 12 °C for 32 days under 85-90% relative humidity. Compared with control, all treatments were significantly effective in preserving fruit quality. Fruits treated with MT-TRG showed significantly lower decay values, respiration rates, ethylene production, and weight loss than untreated fruits. MT-TRG treatment significantly enhanced fruit quality, thereby maintaining fruit appearance, flesh color, firmness, total soluble solids and phenolic contents, and pectin methyl esterase, polyphenol oxidase, and peroxidase activities during the storage period. We propose 200 µM MT + 1% TRG as a safe postharvest treatment to reduce the deterioration of mangoes and maintain fruit quality."

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. The present study is an effort to reveal the antiproliferative and antioxidant actions of mango seed kernel extract (KE), peel extract (PE), and their combination (KEPE) on mammary tumors induced by 7,12 dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). Seven groups of adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared, including C: (control), DMBA: (rats were administered with DMBA), (DMBA-KE), (DMBA-PE), and (DMBA-KEPE): rats were administered with DMBA and then treated with KE, PE, and (both KE and PE), respectively, (KE) and (PE): rats were administered with KE and PE, separately. The study focused on the assessment of markers of endocrine derangement [serum 17-β estradiol (E2)], apoptosis [caspase-3 and deoxyribonucleic acid fragmentation (DNAF)], and oxidative stress [lipid peroxidation and antioxidants (glutathione, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase)]. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical expression of caspase-3 and estrogen receptor-α (ER-α) in mammary gland tissues (MGTs) were determined, as well as the characterization of mango extracts. The results showed that DMBA administration induced mammary tumors by increasing cell proliferation and evading apoptosis. In addition, DMBA administration caused oxidative stress by the production of reactive oxygen species, which increased lipid peroxidation and decreased cellular antioxidants, allowing cancer to progress. In contrast, treatment with DMBA-KE, DMBA-PE, or DMBA-KEPE diminished mammary tumors induced by DMBA, where they reduced oxidative stress via increased antioxidant parameters including reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, total glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione S-transferase. Also, different treatments decreased proliferation through the reduction of E2, and ER-α expression levels. However, these treatments increased the apoptosis of unwanted cells as they increased caspase-3 activity and DNAF. All these changes led to the prevention of breast injuries and the reduction of mammary tumors. This demonstrates that the contents of mango extracts, especially phenolics and flavonoids, have an important role in mammary tumor treatment through their potential antioxidant, antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and anti-estrogenic effects. KE and PE administration for 4 weeks had no adverse effects. Conclusion: Each of KE, PE, and KEPE has a therapeutic effect against DMBA-induced mammary tumors via induction of apoptosis and reduction of each of the OS, proliferation, and estrogenic effects. So, they can play an important role in the pharmacological tole.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Increased soil salinity in the recent years has adversely affected the productivity of mango globally. Extending the cultivation of mango in salt affected regions warrants the use of salinity tolerant/resistant rootstocks. However, the lack of sufficient genomic and transcriptomic information impedes comprehensive research at the molecular level. METHOD: We employed RNA sequencing-based transcriptome analysis to gain insight into molecular response to salt stress by using two polyembryonic mango genotypes with contrasting response to salt stress viz., salt tolerant Turpentine and salt susceptible Mylepelian. RESULTS: RNA sequencing by Novaseq6000 resulted in a total of 2795088, 17535948, 7813704 and 5544894 clean reads in Mylepelian treated (MT), Mylepelian control (MC), Turpentine treated (TT) and Turpentine control (TC) respectively. In total, 7169 unigenes annotated against all the five public databases, including NR, NT, PFAM, KOG, Swissport, KEGG and GO. Further, maximum number of differentially expressed genes were found between MT and MC (2106) followed by MT vs TT (1158) and TT and TC (587). The differentially expressed genes under different treatment levels included transcription factors (bZIP, NAC, bHLH), genes involved in Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs), ABA biosynthesis, Photosynthesis etc. Expression of few of these genes was experimentally validated through quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and contrasting expression pattern of Auxin Response Factor 2 (ARF2), Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) and CDPK genes were observed between Turpentine and Mylepelian. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will be useful in understanding the molecular mechanism underlying salt tolerance in mango which can serve as valuable baseline information to generate new targets in mango breeding for salt tolerance."

In the present study, four MiFPF genes, namely, MiFPF1, MiFPF2, MiFPF3a, and MiFPF3b, were obtained from mango (Mangifera indica L.). Tissue expression analysis showed that MiFPFs were expressed in all mango tissues. Specifically, MiFPF1 and MiFPF2 were highly expressed in leaves, while MiFPF3a and MiFPF3b were highly expressed in flowers and buds. The four MiFPF proteins localize to the nucleus. Overexpression of MiFPFs in transgenic Arabidopsis resulted in early flowering and upregulated the expression of APETAL1 (AP1), FLOWERING LOCUS D (FD) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). MiFPF genes increased the root growth of transgenic Arabidopsis plants under gibberellin treatment. BiFC assays showed that MiFPFs can interact with several DELLA proteins. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the MiFPF gene was involved not only in promoting flowering but also in increasing root growth under gibberellin (GA3) treatment.",

The beneficial effects of mango supplementation on metabolic diseases have been detected. However, research into mango consumption on gut health, including the microbiome, is limited to processed mango preparations or peels. Our goal was to examine the effects of fresh mango consumption on the gut microbiome, gut permeability proteins, and bowel movement habits in overweight/obese individuals. In a 12-week crossover design study, 27 participants consumed 100 kcal/day of either mangos or low-fat cookies with a washout period of 4 weeks. The mango intervention showed higher Shannon-Wiener and Simpson alpha diversity indices of the microbiome than the low-fat cookie intervention in week 4. Significant differences in beta diversity of the microbiome were found between diet interventions at week 12. Mango consumption increased the abundance of Prevotella maculosa, Corynebacterium pyruviciproducens, and Mogibacterium timidum while it decreased Prevotella copri. Low-fat cookie intake increased Cyanobacterium aponinum and Desulfovibrio butyratiphilus and reduced Alloscardovia omnicolens. There were no significant differences in circulating gut permeability protein (ZO-1, claudin-2, and occludin) levels. There was a slight increase in the amount of bowel movement with mango consumption, but no significant findings for frequency, consistency, strain, pain, and constipation in bowel movement between trials. Given these results, it can be concluded that consumption of mango may have positive effects on the gut health, which may yield possible health benefits for chronic disease that deserve further study."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Validated prognostic biomarkers for anti-angiogenic therapy using the anti-VEGF antibody Bevacizumab in ovarian cancer (OC) patients are still an unmet clinical need. The EGFR can contribute to cancer-associated biological mechanisms in OC cells including angiogenesis, but its targeting gave disappointing results with less than 10% of OC patients treated with anti-EGFR compounds showing a positive response, likely due to a non adequate selection and stratification of EGFR-expressing OC patients. METHODS: EGFR membrane expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of 310 OC patients from the MITO-16A/MANGO-OV2A trial, designed to identify prognostic biomarkers of survival in patients treated with first line standard chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. Statistical analyses assessed the association between EGFR and clinical prognostic factors and survival outcomes. A single sample Gene Set Enrichment-like and Ingenuity Pathway Analyses were applied to the gene expression profile of 195 OC samples from the same cohort. In an OC in vitro model, biological experiments were performed to assess specific EGFR activation. RESULTS: Based on EGFR-membrane expression, three OC subgroups of patients were identified being the subgroup with strong and homogeneous EGFR membrane localization, indicative of possible EGFR out/in signalling activation, an independent negative prognostic factor for overall survival of patients treated with an anti-angiogenic agent. This OC subgroup resulted statistically enriched of tumors of histotypes different than high grade serous lacking angiogenic molecular characteristics. At molecular level, among the EGFR-related molecular traits identified to be activated only in this patients' subgroup the crosstalk between EGFR with other RTKs also emerged. In vitro, we also showed a functional cross-talk between EGFR and AXL RTK; upon AXL silencing, the cells resulted more sensitive to EGFR targeting with erlotinib. CONCLUSIONS: Strong and homogeneous cell membrane localization of EGFR, associated with specific transcriptional traits, can be considered a prognostic biomarker in OC patients and could be useful for a better OC patients' stratification and the identification of alternative therapeutic target/s in a personalized therapeutic approach.",

      "abstract": "Mango (Mangifera indica L.), belongs to the family Anacardiacea, and is one of the most popular tropical fruits in the world. Stem-end rot is a major postharvest disease of mango fruit, causing severe losses during storage in China (Chen et al., 2015). In July 2021, the mango fruits harvested from Baise Municipal National Agricultural Science and Technology Park (23.683568 N, 106.986325 E) of Guangxi province in China developed stem-end rot during storage. The disease incidence reached ca. 8.3%. The initial symptoms appeared as light brown lesions surrounding the peduncle, which quickly expanded becoming large dark-brown lesions. Small pieces of epidermis (5 mm × 5 mm) from 8 typical diseased friuts were cut from the edges of lesions surface-sterilized with 2% sodium hypochlorite and rinsed with sterile distilled water. The tissue was plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 28 ℃ in the dark for 3 days. Fifteen, similarcolonies were isolated from the symptomatic tissue. The representative isolates DF-1, DF-2 and DF-3 were selected for morphological characterization, molecular identification, and pathogenicity testing. The colonies were circular with fluffy aerial mycelium, initially white turning to smoke-gray from the center in upper side and greenish black in reverse side, covering the 90 mm diameter Petri dish after 4 days of incubation on PDA at 28 ℃ in dark. Pycnidia were produced on the surface of the colony after 30 days. Conidia were fusiform, aseptate, hyaline, thin-walled with granular contents, apex sub-obtuse, base subtruncate to bluntly rounded, 14.0-20.3 (16.8±1.6) μm × 3.1-7.2 (5.1±0.9) μm (n=50). The sexual stage was absent. Based on morphology, isolates were preliminarily identified as Botryosphaeria speices. To accurately identify the pathogen, genomic DNA was extracted from the mycelium of the three isolates DF-1, DF-2 and DF-3. The internal transcribed spacer of rDNA region (ITS), elongation factor 1-alpha (EF-1α) and beta-tubulin gene (TUB) genes were amplified using primers ITS1/ITS4, EF1-728F/EF1-986R and Bt2a/Bt2b, respectively (Slippers et al., 2004). The nucleotide sequences were all deposited in GenBank (ITS: OP729176-OP729178 EF-1α: OP758194-OP758196 and TUB: OP758197-OP758199). Based on the BLASTn analysis, the ITS, EF1-α and TUB sequences of three isolates were 100%, 99% and 99% similar to the Botryosphaeria fabicerciana MFLUCC 10-0098 sequences (ITS: JX646789, EF-1α: JX646854 and TUB: JX646839). Multi-locus phylogenetic analyses (ITS, EF-1α and TUB) showed that the isolate DF-1, DF-2 and DF-3 were clustered within Botryosphaeria fabicerciana clade based on the maximum likelihood , Bayesian inference, and maximum parsimony methods. The pathogenicity test was performed by placing discs mycelium around the peduncle of mature mango fruits by pin-prick method. Each treatment carried out with 12 fruits. The inoculated fruits were placed in plastic boxes at 28 ℃ with three replicates. Three days after inoculation, typical symptoms of stem-end rot were observed. The control fruits were inoculated with sterile PDA discs, and remained symptomless. The same fungus was re-isolated from the symptomatic tissue to complete Koch's postulate. Botryosphaeria fabicerciana (basionym: Fusicoccum fabicercianum) was first reported as pathogen causing senescent twig of Eucalyptus spp. in China (Chen et al., 2011; Phillips et al., 2013). To our knowledge, this is the first report of Botryosphaeria fabicerciana causing stem-end rot of Mangifera indica in China."

However, effect of light on the different flavonoids compositions accumulation in mango and the relevant molecular mechanism still need to be clarified. METHODS: In this study, green-mature fruits of red mango cultivar 'Zill' were subjected to postharvest light treatment, and fruit peel color, total soluble solids content, total organic acid, and firmness of flesh were measured. The flavonoids metabolites profile, and the expression of flavonoids-related genes and light signal pathway genes were also analyzed. RESULTS: Results showed that light treatment promoted the red coloration of fruit peel and increased the total soluble solids content and firmness of flesh. The concentration of flavonols, proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins, and expression of key flavonoids biosynthetic genes including MiF3H, MiFLS, MiLAR, MiANS, MiUFGT1, and MiUFGT3 were significantly induced by light. The MYBs regulating flavonols and proanthocyanidins, i.e. MiMYB22 and MiMYB12, as well as the key light signal pathway transcription factors (TFs) MiHY5 and MiHYH, were identified in mango. The transcription of MiMYB1, MiMYB12, MiMYB22, MiHY5 and MiHYH was up-regulated by light.

(2) Methods: Different power sonication conditions (120, 300, and 480 W) and sonication time (10, 20, and 30 min) were evaluated along with a control treatment (extracted by the wet milling method). (3) Results: Ultrasound-assisted extraction increases starch yield, with the highest values (54%) at 480 W and 20 min. A significant increase in the amylose content, water-holding capacity, oil-holding capacity, solubility, and swelling power of ultrasonically extracted starches was observed. Similarly, mango kernel starch (MKS) exhibited interesting antioxidant properties. The sol-gel transition temperature and pasting parameters, such as the breakdown viscosity (BD) and the setback viscosity (SB), decreased with ultrasound application; (4) Conclusion: indicating that ultrasound caused changes in physical, chemical, techno-functional, rheological, and pasting properties, depending on the power and time of sonication, so it can be used as an alternative starch extraction and modification technique, for example, for potential application in thermally processed food products such as baked goods, canned foods, and frozen foods."

Bark) in Colombia. Nine entomopathogenic fungi isolates were evaluated, five belonging to the genus Metarhizium and four belonging to the genus Beauveria. One strain of the species Metarhizium robertsii with insecticidal activity was selected. By column fractionation, an active fraction was obtained, which caused mortalities higher than 90% after 48 h of exposure. Through HPLC it was determined that the active fraction is composed of more than 22 metabolites. Identification of the metabolites by UHPLC MS/MS revealed the presence of destruxin in E, D, A and B groups (destruxin E-diol, destruxin D, destruxin D1, destruxin D2, destruxin A2, destruxin A, destruxin A3, dihydrodestruxin A, desmB, destruxin B2, destruxin B and destruxin B1). The evaluation of the insecticidal capacity of the organic fractions obtained by HPLC indicated that the extract obtained from the isolate M. robertsii had a compound with high activity on adults of A. obliqua (destruxin A) causing massive mortality of up to 100%, after 48 h of the treatment administration. Furthermore, two other compounds with medium activity were found (destruxin A2 and destruxin B), showing mortalities between 60.0 and 81.3%, respectively. The extract of the isolate MT008 of M. robertsii showed higher insecticidal activity and a potential source for the control of A. obliqua.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Flavonoids are important water soluble secondary metabolites in plants, and light is one of the most essential environmental factors regulating flavonoids biosynthesis. In the previous study, we found bagging treatment significantly inhibited the accumulation of flavonols and anthocyanins but promoted the proanthocyanidins accumulation in the fruit peel of mango (Mangifera indica L.) cultivar 'Sensation', while the relevant molecular mechanism is still unknown. METHODS: In this study, RNA-seq was conducted to identify the key pathways and genes involved in the light-regulated flavonoids biosynthesis in mango peel. RESULTS: By weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), 16 flavonoids biosynthetic genes were crucial for different flavonoids compositions biosynthesis under bagging treatment in mango. The higher expression level of LAR (mango026327) in bagged samples might be the reason why light inhibits proanthocyanidins accumulation in mango peel. The reported MYB positively regulating anthocyanins biosynthesis in mango, MiMYB1, has also been identified by WGCNA in this study. Apart from MYB and bHLH, ERF, WRKY and bZIP were the three most important transcription factors (TFs) involved in the light-regulated flavonoids biosynthesis in mango, with both activators and repressors. Surprisingly, two HY5 transcripts, which are usually induced by light, showed higher expression level in bagged samples. DISCUSSION: Our results provide new insights of the regulatory effect of light on the flavonoids biosynthesis in mango fruit peel."

      "abstract": "This study examined if weeds could serve as insectary plants to increase beneficial insect abundance and diversity in mango cultivation in southern Florida. Additionally, we examined how weed presence affects mango tree soil health. We found that weeds significantly increased pollinating and parasitoid insect abundance and diversity. Eight insect orders and eighteen families were significantly more abundant on mango trees with weeds growing beneath them than those where weeds were removed. There was no difference in predatory insects between treatments, and slightly more herbivorous insects on weedy mango trees. Pollinating insects visiting mango flowers in the weed treatment were significantly greater, as well as spiders on weedy mango trees. However, there were more lacewings (Neuroptera) observed on the mango trees without weeds, and leaf chlorophyll in the old and new mango leaves was significantly greater, in the weed-free treatment. Soil conditions, however, significantly improved in soil carbon and a greater pH reduction in the presence of weeds, though weeds affected neither soil nitrogen, phosphorous, nor chlorophyll in productive green leaves. These results show that a tolerable level of selective weed species' presence may benefit insect, plant, and soil biodiversity in farms. This is important in increasing production, sustainability, and biodiversity in agriculture, which otherwise may be deficient in non-crop life."

The compositions of almonds display starch as the major constituent (60-65%) with more than 80% of amylopectin and a significant presence of phenolic compounds (1-7%), lipids (7-13%), and proteins (4-7%), depending on mango varieties, with local varieties showing the highest polyphenol and lipid contents. Almond flours are characterized by high WAC (water absorption capacity) and OAC (oil absorption capacity) and pasting properties influenced by starch lipid and starch protein complexes. In wheat-mango almond composite flours, the pasting properties are mango variety and almond flour treatment (native or delipidated) dependent, with a substitution threshold effect variable from one variety to another. Alveographic profiles of the composite flours result in dough characterized by high tenacity (P) but low swelling index (G) and baking strength (W). These effects are intensified with increasing substitution of wheat. However, up to 10% wheat substitution, the composite flours seem acceptable in breadmaking, with 9 mango varieties hypothetically convenient for the reduction of bread staling."

One of the most prevalent zoonotic bacteria transmitted through dairy milk is Staphylococcus aureus. Given the limitations of the conventional detection methods, in the current study we desigined a competitive lateral flow immune assay (LFIA) using colloidal silver nanoparticles derived from mango leaves for the detection of Staphylococcus aureus in cow milk. SpA, a recombinant protein of Staphylococcus aureus, was used to raised hyperimmune sera used for developing the assay followed by conjugation with the synthesized nanoparticles. To increase the specificity of the assay, the milk samples were prenriched with selective agar exclusively require for Staphyloccocus aureus. The assay was found to be completed within 7-8 h by observing test and control lines in LFIA strips. The developed assay was found to specifically detect the bacteria as low as 1000 cfu/ml of milk samples. With a total 230 number of raw and clinical mastitis milk samples, the assay was validated and achieved relative accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity values of 97.39, 98.03, and 96.1%, respectively. The developed LFIA, which uses economically feasible and stable silver nanoparticles derived from mango leaves, has the potential for routine screening of milk samples for the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, especially in low-resource settings, allowing for early diagnosis, which facilitates effective treatment for the dairy animals and prevents the transmission of the disease in consumers."

      "abstract": "Mango by-products are important sources of bioactive compounds generated by agro-industrial process. During mango processing, 35-60% of the fruit is discarded, in many cases without treatment, generating environmental problems and economic losses. These wastes are constituted by peels and seeds (tegument and kernel). The aim of this review was to describe the extraction, identification, and quantification of bioactive compounds, as well as their potential applications, published in the last ten years. The main bioactive compounds in mango by-products are polyphenols and carotenoids, among others. Polyphenols are known for their high antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Carotenoids show provitamin A and antioxidant activity. Among the mango by-products, the kernel has been studied more than tegument and peels because of the proportion and composition. The kernel represents 45-85% of the seed. The main bioactive components reported for the kernel are gallic, caffeic, cinnamic, tannic, and chlorogenic acids; methyl and ethyl gallates; mangiferin, rutin, hesperidin, and gallotannins; and penta-O-galloyl-glucoside and rhamnetin-3-[6-2-butenoil-hexoside]. Meanwhile, gallic acid, ferulic acid, and catechin are reported for mango peel. Although most of the reports are at the laboratory level, they include potential applications in the fields of food, active packaging, oil and fat, and pharmaceutics. At the market level, two trends will stimulate the industrial production of bioactive compounds from mango by-products: the increasing demand for industrialized fruit products (that will increase the by-products) and the increase in the consumption of bioactive ingredients.",

The classical management of mango hopper is with systemic insecticides but their overuse has caused environmental pollution. Here, we have evaluated the entomopathogenic role of Clonostachys rosea through bioassay and optimized media for its large-scale culturing. The current study reveals the potentiality of C. rosea as entomopathogenic on A. atkinsoni. Initially, morphological and molecular characterization was used to validate local isolates' identity as C. rosea. Further, we have evaluated the entomopathogenic role of C. rosea through a bioassay, where the highest mean mortality in A. atkinsoni was observed at a treatment concentration of 3 × 108 conidia/mL, with 96.67% mortality after 168 h of infection. This work also provides insight into the laboratory-based media standardization for C. rosea, resulting in oatmeal agar media and broth as the most suitable artificial media, and 20 °C temperature for its mass culture. Thus, C. rosea is a novo-entomopathogenic fungus on A. atkinsoni and has a high potency to be included in the management of mango hopper pests."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insufficient low temperatures in winter and soil residues caused by paclobutrazol (PBZ) application pose a considerable challenge for mango floral induction (FI). Gibberellin inhibitors SPD (compound of mepiquat chloride, prohexadione-calcium and uniconazole) had a significant influence on enhancing the flowering rate and yield of mango for two consecutive years (2020-2021). Researchers have indicated that FI is regulated at the metabolic level; however, little is known about the metabolic changes during FI in response to SPD treatment. METHODS: Here, ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS)-based widely targeted metabolomic analysis was carried out to assess the metabolic differences in the mango stem apex during different stage of mango FI (30, 80, 100 days after SPD/water treatment). RESULTS: A total of 582 compounds were annotated and 372 metabolites showed two-fold differences in abundance (variable importance in projection, VIP ≥ 1 and fold change, FC≥ 2 or≤ 0.5) between buds at 30, 80, 100 days after SPD/water treatment or between buds under different treatment. Lipids, phenolic acids, amino acids, carbohydrates, and vitamins were among metabolites showing significant differences over time after SPD treatment. Here, 18 out of 20 lipids, including the lysophosphatidylethanolamine (12, LPE), lysophosphatidylcholine (7, LPC), and free fatty acids (1, FA), were significantly upregulated from 80 to 100 days after SPD treatment comared to water treatment. Meanwhile, the dormancy release of mango buds from 80 to 100 days after SPD treatment was accompanied by the accumulation of proline, ascorbic acid, carbohydrates, and tannins. In addition, metabolites, such as L-homocysteine, L-histidine, and L-homomethionine, showed more than a ten-fold difference in relative abundance from 30 to 100 days after SPD treatment, however, there were no significant changes after water treatment. The present study reveals novel metabolites involved in mango FI in response to SPD, which would provide a theoretical basis for utilizing SPD to induce mango flowering.",

The mode of action of mango fruit tolerance to suboptimal cold temperature of 7 or 10 °C after postharvest application of 8 mM phenylalanine was investigated using transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of mango fruit during suboptimal cold storage. Phenylalanine-treated fruit had less chilling injuries-black spot and pitting electrolyte leakage,-and reduced decay after suboptimal cold storage. Phenylalanine treatment induced genes related to plant-pathogen interactions, plant hormone signal transduction, and the phenylpropanoid pathway, increasing the levels of the flavonoids quercetin and kaempferol glycosides and anthocyanins, and antioxidant content. Reduced oxidation led to lower lipid peroxidation, and a reduction in fatty acid-degradation products, e.g., volatile aldehydes. Treatment with phenylalanine, therefore, enhances chilling tolerance of mango fruit through regulation of metabolic and defense-related pathways, maintaining high levels of flavonoids, and antioxidants enzyme activity, and reducing H2O2 content, lipid peroxidation, and volatile aldehydes.",

Edible coatings such as hydrocolloids (HC) bear promising potential for fruit quality preservation at ambient storage due to its triple action (physiological, biochemical and pathological) on fruit and thus widely researched in recent years. This study demonstrates the influence of health and eco-safe hydrocolloid edible coatings such as \"Carboxymethyl cellulose\" (CMC) (1%), \"Guar gum\" (1.5%), \"Gum Arabica\" (10%), and \"Xanthan gum\" (0.3%) as dip treatment to enhance the postharvest quality and storage life of mangoes at ambient storage (25 ± 4°C and 65 ± 5% RH). \"Xanthan gum\" (0.3%) treatment exhibited the highest efficacy in reducing the decay loss by more than threefold and physiological loss by twofold over control fruit. It lowered the physiological and fruit softening enzyme activities (PG, PME, and LOX), while maintaining the biochemicals. Moreover, it maintained both internal as well as external (consumer preference) quality of fruit and extended 6 days shelf life on the physiological loss standard basis (≤10%) than that of the control. The results recommend the application of \"Xanthan gum\" (0.3%) as an efficacious ecological, sustainable, and health-friendly surface edible coating for quality preservation and storage period extension of mango fruit under ambient storage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The selected hydrocolloid edible coatings dip treatment showed promising potential in controlling the physiological, biochemical, and pathological deterioration of mango fruit stored under ambient condition. The selected treatments extended the shelf life without diminishing fruit quality. However, among the attempted HC treatments, the \"Xanthan gum\" (0.3%) (XG) coating displayed the excellent results. It added the storage life of mango fruit by 6 days over the control. XG treated fruit displayed the excellent results in terms of storage period extension, quality retention, consumer preference, and control over the fruit decay and softening enzymes activities. Postharvest preservation of mango fruit using HC is nonchemical, cost-effective approach which is GRAS (generally recognized as safe), health, and eco safe.",

Its use as an edible coating has been reported on certain fruits. However, the effect of TCG coating in the regulation of harvested mango fruits ripening and softening has not been reported yet. So, the objective of this work was to investigate the effect of TCG (control, 0.5 %, 1 % and 1.5 %) coating on postharvest softening and ripening of harvested mango fruits. TCG coating affected the ripening and softening of mango in a dose-dependent manner. Results exhibited that mango fruits coated with 1.5 % TCG showed substantially lower disease incidence and weight loss. The 1.5 % TCG-coated mangoes showed substantially lower ethylene biosynthesis and respiration rate peaks as well as superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide contents compared with the control. In the same way, 1.5 % TCG-coated mango fruits had markedly higher total chlorophyll content and lower L*, b* and a* along with substantially lower total carotenoids in peel tissues. Mango fruits coated with 1.5 % TCG exhibited markedly lower water-soluble pectin and higher chelate-soluble pectin, Na2CO3-soluble pectin, protopectin, cellulose and hemicellulose in flesh tissues compared with control. The activity of polygalacturonase (PG), cellulase (CX), pectin methylesterase (PME), β-galactosidase (β-Gal) and β-glucosidase (β-Glu) were significantly lower in flesh of 1.5 % TCG treated fruits along with substantially higher firmness in contrast with control. In addition, 1.5 % TCG coating treatment showed significantly higher activity of antioxidative enzymes and delayed the increase in soluble solids content (SSC) and ripening index (RI) along with considerably higher titratable acidity (TA) compared with the untreated control. So, pre-storage TCG based edible coating (1.5 %) could be applied to delay ripening and softening in mango fruit industry under postharvest ambient conditions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The detection of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) can identify patients who are more responsive to platinum and poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). MyChoice CDx (Myriad) is the most used HRD test in ovarian cancer (OC). However, some limitations of commercial tests exist, because of the high rate of inconclusive results, costs, and the impossibility of evaluating functional resistance mechanisms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two academic genomic tests and a functional assay, the RAD51 foci, were evaluated to detect HRD. One hundred patients with high-grade OC enrolled in the MITO16A/MaNGO-OV2 trial and treated with first-line therapy with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab were analyzed. RESULTS: The failure rate of the two genomic assays was 2%. The sensitivity in detecting HRD when compared with Myriad was 98.1% and 90.6%, respectively. The agreement rate with Myriad was 0.92 and 0.87, with a Cohen's κ coefficient corresponding to 0.84 and 0.74, respectively. For the RAD51 foci assay, the failure rate was 30%. When the test was successful, discordant results for deficient and proficient tumors were observed, and additional HRD patients were identified compared to Myriad; sensitivity was 82.9%, agreement rate was 0.65, and Cohen's κ coefficient was 0.18. The HRD detected by genomic assays and residual tumor at primary surgery and stage was correlated with progression-free survival at multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest the feasibility of academic tests for assessing HRD status that show robust concordance with Myriad and correlation with clinical outcome. The contribution of the functional information related to the RAD51 foci test to the genomic data needs further investigation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impact of mango consumption on metabolic pathways assessed by changes in gene expression. METHODS: In this single-arm clinical trial, cardiometabolic outcomes and gene expression levels in whole blood samples from 26 men and women were examined at baseline and after 8 weeks of mango consumption and differential gene expression changes were determined. Based on changes in gene expression profiles, partial least squares discriminant analysis followed by hierarchical clustering were used to classify participants into subgroups of response and differences in gene expression changes and in cardiometabolic clinical outcomes following the intervention were tested. RESULTS: Two subgroups of participants were separated based on the resemblance of gene expression profiles in response to the intervention and as responders (n = 8) and non-responders (n = 18). A total of 280 transcripts were significantly up-regulated and 603 transcripts down-regulated following the intervention in responders, as compared to non-responders. Several metabolic pathways, mainly related to oxygen and carbon dioxide transport as well as oxidative stress, were found to be significantly enriched with differentially expressed genes. In addition, significantly beneficial changes in hip and waist circumference, c-reactive protein, HOMA-IR and QUICKI indices were observed in responders vs. non-responders, following the intervention. CONCLUSION: The impact of mango consumption on cardiometabolic health appears to largely rely on interindividual variability. The novel transcriptomic-based clustering analysis used herein can provide insights for future research focused on unveiling the origins of heterogeneous responses to dietary interventions.

      "abstract": "There is evidence that in schizophrenia, imbalances in inflammatory and oxidative processes occur during pregnancy and in the early postnatal period, generating interest in the potential therapeutic efficacy of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds. Mangiferin is a polyphenolic compound abundant in the leaves of Mangifera indica L. that has robust antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a potential candidate for preventive or co-adjuvant therapy in schizophrenia. Hence, this study set-out to evaluate the effect of mango leaf extract (MLE) in a model of schizophrenia based on maternal immune activation, in which Poly I:C (4 mg/kg) is administered intravenously to pregnant rats. Young adult (postnatal day 60-70) or adolescent (postnatal day 35-49) male offspring received MLE (50 mg/kg of mangiferin) daily, and the effects of MLE in adolescence were compared to those of risperidone, assessing behavior, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and oxidative/inflammatory and antioxidant mediators in the adult offspring. MLE treatment in adulthood reversed the deficit in prepulse inhibition (PPI) but it failed to attenuate the sensitivity to amphetamine and the deficit in novel object recognition (NOR) induced. By contrast, adolescent MLE treatment prevented the sensorimotor gating deficit in the PPI test, producing an effect similar to that of risperidone. This MLE treatment also produced a reduction in grooming behavior, but it had no effect on anxiety or novel object recognition memory. MRI studies revealed that adolescent MLE administration partially counteracted the cortical shrinkage, and cerebellum and ventricle enlargement. In addition, MLE administration in adolescence reduced iNOS mediated inflammatory activation and it promoted the expression of biomarkers of compensatory antioxidant activity in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, as witnessed through the reduction of Keap1 and the accumulation of NRF2 and HO1. Together, these findings suggest that MLE might be an alternative therapeutic or preventive add-on strategy to improve the clinical expression of schizophrenia in adulthood, while also modifying the time course of this disease at earlier stages in populations at high-risk."

Swell-drying consisted of (1) submitting fresh mangoes to a first pre-drying stage under Convective Air Drying (CAD) until a moisture content of 37% d.b; (2) applying Instant Controlled Pressure Drop (DIC) treatments on pre-dried mangoes by following a central composite rotatable design (steam pressure: 0.2-0.6 MPa and treatment time: 5 and 55 s); and (3) apply post-drying of mangoes under CAD. In both cases, CAD was performed at 60 °C and airflow of 1 m/s. Results showed that both the treatment time and the steam pressure impacted the Dapp and the δW. By comparing to the control, SD (0.54 MPa and 48 s) increased the Dapp and δW to 12.2 and 2.7 times, respectively. Moreover, SD triggers a significant reduction in post-drying time (tf = 20% d.b), being this of 2.4 h vs. 30.8 h. These results could be linked to the expansion of the internal pores of mangoes generated by the instant autovaporization of residual water triggered by DIC treatment."

Higher retention of carotenoids, phenolic compounds, and ascorbic acid was obtained with shorter drying times and lower oxygen exposure. Impregnated dried samples submitted to ultrasound-assisted vacuum impregnation showed a higher drying rate, greater retention of carotenoids (6.77 µg/g DM), and softer samples. Greater retention of phenolic compounds (1.84 mg GAE/g DM) was obtained for osmotic dehydration-assisted vacuum impregnation dried mango, while osmosonication-assisted impregnation was able to retain the highest ascorbic acid content (7.05 mg/100 g DM). Sensory evaluation showed that the impregnated samples showed good acceptance. The combination of osmotic dehydration and ultrasound could be a suitable way to produce dried mango impregnated with grape residue polyphenols.",
