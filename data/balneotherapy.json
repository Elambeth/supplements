      "abstract": "Balneotherapy (BT) is considered an effective, non-pharmacological approach, in the multimodal treatment of the Primary Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FS). However, the evidence of efficacy and tolerability of BT in FS is still limited. This is a prospective multi-center two-cohort observational study. The main aim will be the comparison of the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (according to Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-FIQ) achievement in FS patients treated with BT vs standard care. Secondary objectives will be to assess: a) BT impact on pain, quality of life, anxiety and depression; b) the persistence of benefits in six weeks c) BT safety profile. All FS patients with a stable treatment in the past 3 months and a moderate to severe disease (FIQ score ≥ 39) will be enrolled after providing written informed consent. Patients will be divided into two Cohort: a) BT Cohort (i.e., BT in addition to standard care)-BTC; b) Control Cohort (i.e., only standard care)-SCC. There will be three assessments: baseline, two and six weeks (i.e., one month after BT end in BTC). At each of them the subject will fill in the following questionnaires: FIQ, VAS pain, Short Form Health Survey 16, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. We expect to observe a more relevant improvement of disease activity in BTC than in SCC. The positive effect may extend even to pain, quality of life, anxiety and depression. The short- and medium-term effects are likely to be similar, without any significant warning in terms of tolerability. Collected data, deriving from a large sample of patients, will provide a new insight of BT role in moderate to severe FS treatment. In particular, it will be possible to quantify the short and medium-term BT impact on disease activity and secondary symptoms related to FS."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In our modern era, stress has become a pervasive challenge, affecting individuals across all ages and backgrounds. Acute or chronic stress and elevated cortisol levels are known to impair neurological function and hinder rehabilitation outcomes. Therefore, effective treatment methods that reduce stress, enhance mental health, and promote overall well-being are urgently needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the seasonal impact of balneotherapy on distress, as measured by the General Symptoms Distress Scale (GSDS), and well-being, as assessed using the Arizona Integrative Outcomes Scale (AIOS), and the effect of winter balneotherapy on salivary cortisol levels. METHODS: In 2023, a multicenter, single-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial was carried out across six medical spa centers in Lithuania. Participants with a stress intensity greater than 3 points on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) underwent combined natural resource-based therapies over a 1- to 2-week treatment period. Outcomes were assessed using the General Symptom Distress and Arizona Integrative Outcomes scales, along with salivary cortisol measurements after winter intervention. RESULTS: The results demonstrated a significant reduction in distress intensity by 1-3.5 points (VAS), with winter interventions showing greater efficacy compared to summer. Participants also experienced an increase in well-being by up to 3 points (VAS), improved stress management by up to 1.9 points (VAS), and a reduction in salivary cortisol levels by 0.9 units following winter-based treatments. Some gender differences emerged in specific groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides robust evidence for the stress-reducing effects of balneotherapy, particularly highlighting the enhanced efficacy of winter interventions. These findings are especially relevant for neurological rehabilitation, where stress reduction and improved autonomic regulation can support neuroplasticity, recovery processes, and overall quality of life. This research offers valuable insights for developing holistic, seasonally optimized strategies to aid stress management and promote neurological health."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Post-Acute COVID Syndrome (PACS) is a complex disorder that currently lacks effective evidenced-based therapies to manage it. This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the effects of balneotherapy (BT) on PACS symptomatology. METHODS: Ninety-eight adults with PACS visited at Hospital del Mar Research Institute, Barcelona (Spain) were included to the study. Participants in the intervention group (n = 51) were allocated to 12 sessions of BT and aquatic exercises delivered in one month while the control group (n = 47) did not. The primary outcome was to evaluate the absolute change in questionnaire scores between baseline and two follow-up points: immediately after balneotherapy (or one-month post-baseline for the control group) and 2 months post-baseline. The following scales/questionnaires were employed: Post-COVID-19 functional status scale, mMRC dyspnea Scale, SF-36, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Memory failures in everyday life following severe head injury, and Visual Analogic Scale (VAS). RESULTS: Forty-seven patients in the BT group and 43 in the control group completed the study. The majority of participants were middle-aged women (> 84%; mean age 48 years), and the most prevalent symptoms were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and neurocognitive impairment (> 88%). Noteworthy, the vast majority did not undergo a severe primary infection (ICU admissions < 3%). After BT, significant improvement was detected in the BT group vs. the control group in various SF-36 domains, PSQI total score (Beta-coefficient [95%CI] 2.641 [1.15;4.12]; p -value = 0.003), HAD's anxiety subscale (Beta-coefficient [95%CI] 1.72 [0.40;3.03;p-value = 0.023), and VAS (Beta-coefficient [95%CI] 1.625 [0.32;2.96]; p-value = 0.026). Among these, SF-36's energy/fatigue and pain subscales exhibited the most prominent changes with a Beta-coefficient [95%CI] of -17.45 [-24.23;-10.66] and - 21.634 [-30.48;-12.78], respectively (p-value < 0.0001). No severe adverse effects were reported during BT although seventeen patients reported mild and transient worsening of preexisting symptoms, particularly fatigue/post-exertional malaise mainly in the first sessions of BT. CONCLUSION: Balneotherapy comprise an effective therapeutic modality that can alleviate several symptoms that characterize PACS, particularly musculoskeletal pain and fatigue. However, the sustainability of these effects over time remains uncertain, as evidenced by the loss of some between-group differences at the one-month follow-up.

While conventional treatments show limited efficacy, emerging evidence suggests the potential benefits of balneotherapy in managing persistent symptoms. We aimed to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of balneotherapy and thermal treatment interventions in treating post-COVID-19 syndrome. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, searching major databases through 31 January 2024. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and pilot studies investigating thermal spa treatments for adult post-COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Analysis of six eligible studies (n = 617) demonstrated significant therapeutic benefits. The largest cohort (n = 159) showed 47% reduction in fatigue and 48% reduction in muscle pain (p < 0.01). Comprehensive spa therapy achieved complete symptom resolution in one-third of the participants. Combined spa-ubiquinol therapy improved metabolic function (p < 0.05). All interventions demonstrated favorable safety profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence suggests balneotherapy effectively ameliorates multiple post-COVID-19 symptoms, particularly fatigue, muscle pain, and exercise intolerance. While safety profiles appear favorable, larger randomized controlled trials with standardized protocols are needed to establish definitive therapeutic recommendations."

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of comprehensive medical rehabilitation programs that include natural therapeutic factors (carbonated natural mineral water) on pain, gait, and functional status in these patients. Fifty patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and diabetic neuropathy in the lower limbs participated in the study. Half of them (DZ-PT) underwent treatment consisting of physical exercises, physiotherapy, and terrain cure, while the other half (DZ-CMW) received the same treatment plus baths with carbonated natural mineral water. Patients were evaluated using assessment scales for pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the 10-meter walking test (W10m), lower limb muscle strength (FM), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and Neuropathy Disability Score (NDS). The results showed a statistically significant reduction in pain assessed by VAS at the end of the treatment, persisting for three months (p-values < 0.001 between the two groups), with a greater reduction in the DZ-CMW group. Similarly, a significant improvement in gait, evaluated by W10m, was found both at the end of the treatment and at 3 months after its completion, with greater improvement in the DZ-CMW group. In conclusion, patients with type 2 diabetes with diabetic neuropathy can benefit from comprehensive medical rehabilitation programs periodically, including therapeutic natural factors, at balneoclimacteric resorts, alongside medication, dietary regimen, and physical activity.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effects on gait and posture of balneotherapy in fallers are unknown. We assessed the effects on physical functioning and fear of falling of a balneotherapy program alone or combined with a physical activity and educational program in older adult fallers. METHODS: A multicenter randomized controlled trial enrolled patients aged 65 or older referred to a 3-week balneotherapy program, and screened for risk of falling (a history of falls in the last year and a timed up and go test or a five chair rising test >12 sec or a 4-meter walk test >4 sec). In addition to balneotherapy, patients had either no intervention (controls) or twelve 60-minute sessions of physical activity including 15 minutes of health education and three 90-minute sessions of an educational program (intervention). RESULTS: There were 118 control and 105 intervention patients. The balneotherapy program alone had a clinically significant effect on (i) the grip strength, (ii) the five chair rising test, (iii) the 4-meter walk test, and (iv) the short physical performance battery (Cohen's d 0.29-0.46). It had no effect on (i) the maximum time stood on one foot, and (ii) the timed up and go test. Furthermore, it worsened the falls efficacy scale (d = 0.27). Adding a physical activity and educational program significantly improved (i) the time stood on one foot (Cohen's d =-0.34), and (ii) the timed up and go test (d=- 0.44), (iii) and reduced the concern about falling (Falls Efficacy scale, d=-0.25), and (iv) the fear of falling (d=-0.34). CONCLUSION: Older patients referred to a balneotherapy program and at high risk of falling when screened at the entrance of the center should be offered an additional physical and educational program to further improve the functional effects of balneotherapy on the timed up and go test, balance, and the fear of falling.",

      "abstract": "Background: Epidemiological data indicate that low back pain (LBP) affected 619 million people globally in 2020, representing a significant health and economic burden. Additionally, chronic LBP (cLBP) strongly impairs quality of life and leads to disability and premature retirement, thus emphasizing the need for providing deeper insight into the factors that affect treatment outcomes and for offering thorough guidance for the assessment and management of this condition. Taking into consideration the rising prevalence of cLBP and the knowledge gap referring to the overall health benefits of balneotherapy (BT), the aim of this study was to assess the effects of BT on functional status, quality of life, and psychological symptoms in patients with cLBP. Methods: Among 220 patients from the database, two groups were retrospectively identified: patients receiving conventional pharmacological therapy (CT) and patients receiving BT. The effectiveness of the treatment was assessed through a visual analog scale for pain intensity, EuroQol (EQ-5D), and the Work Ability Index Questionnaire. In order to provide deeper insight into the quality of life and also factors associated with functional status and mental health affected by BT, we also used the Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire and the Center of Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Results: Both age and treatment protocol were found to have a significant impact on all observed parameters, i.e., older patients and those receiving CT tended to report lower overall health and physical functioning. On the other hand, BT was associated with better functionality and disability perception status. Conclusions: Understanding the association between individual perceptions of functionality and its emotional and social elements provides a basis for providing comprehensive guidelines and recommendations for cLBP management."

This study aims to assess the effect of balneotherapy in reducing pain intensity, disability, and depression in patients with FMS. We want to assess this effect at just four time-points: immediately at the end of the therapy, and at 1, 3, and 6 months of follow-up. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted an aggregate data meta-analysis, registered in PROSPERO CRD42023478206, searching PubMed Medline, Science Direct, CINAHL Complete, Scopus, and Web of Science until August 2023 for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assess the effect of balneotherapy on pain intensity, disability, and depression in FMS patients. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane methodology, and the pooled effect was calculated using Cohen's standardized mean difference (SMD) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) in a random-effects model. Sixteen RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. Balneotherapy is effective in reducing pain intensity (SMD - 1.67; 95% CI -2.18 to -1.16), disability (SMD - 1.1; 95% CI -1.46 to -0.7), and depression (SMD - 0.51; 95% CI -0.93 to -0.9) at the end of the intervention. This effect was maintained at 1, 3, and 6 months for pain intensity and disability. Balneotherapy improves both pain intensity and disability in patients with FMS, providing evidence that its positive effects are sustained for up to 6 months of follow-up. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the improvement in depression varies across different temporal phases.",

Sanatorium-resort treatment using balneotherapy is an integral part of rehabilitation measures in such patients. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the results of hydrogen sulfide balneotherapy in children with consequences of thermal injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single-center observational retrospective non-controlled study was carried out, in which sanatorium-resort treatment concerning post-burn scars in 812 children aged 5-17 years was analyzed. Hydrogen sulfide balneotherapy was prescribed to patients depending on the age in mild (5-6 years) or moderate-to-high (7-17 years) exposure modes. The imported hydrogen sulfide mineral water from the T-2000 well of the Matsesta field with the H2S total concentration of 410-420 mg/l was used for treatment. The applications were performed to children alternate days, 8 procedures of balneotherapy per course. RESULTS: Lightening of the affected areas of the skin, reduction of the sensation of contraction and tension of the scars, which became softer, more elastic and more mobile with regard to the subjacent tissues have been noted in patients after the course of balneotherapy. The head mobility increased after applications in the presence of scars. The large joints' range of motion grew up. In addition, an increase in the mobility of the fingers of wrists and feet, a decrease in the stiffness of movements, increase or recovery of the affected skin's tactile sensitivity have been observed. Children well tolerated procedures, adverse events were seen in 0.7% of cases in the form of mild reactions at the beginning of the applications' course, namely of balneological (0.6%) and toxico-allergic (0.1%) nature. CONCLUSION: Hydrogen sulfide balneotherapy in combination with rehabilitation exercises and other sanatorium-resort factors is an effective mean of post-burn scars correction in children.",

      "abstract": "Background: The sulfide-hydrogen sulfide brine balneotherapy (HSBB), including a combination of dissolved hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas, inorganic sulfur ions (S2-), and hydrosulfide ions (HS-), is one of the most important and most effective forms of spa treatment in patients with osteoarticular disorders (OADs). Some cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are often considered to be contraindications to HSBB since the presence of thiol groups may lead to an increased quantity of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which damage the vascular endothelium, and endothelial dysfunction is considered to be the main cause of atherosclerosis. However, there are a number of literature reports suggesting this theory to be false. H2S is a member of the endogenous gaseous transmitter family and, since it is a relatively recent addition, it has the least well-known biological properties. H2S-NO interactions play an important role in oxidative stress in CVDs. The general objective of this study was to assess the cardiovascular safety of HSBB and analyze the effect of HSBB on selected cardiovascular risk markers. Methods: A total of 100 patients at the age of 76.3 (±7.5) years from the Włókniarz Sanatorium in Busko-Zdrój were initially included in the study. The following parameters were assessed: age, sex, height, body weight, body surface area (BSA), body mass index (BMI), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate, the diagnosis of OAD that was the indication for balneotherapy, creatinine (CREAT), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), lipid panel, C-reactive protein (CRP), uric acid (UA), and fibrinogen (FIBR) and cardiovascular markers: (cardiac troponin T (cTnT), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Results: A significant decrease in DBP and a trend towards SBP reduction were observed over the course of the study. A significant decrease was observed in CRP levels decreasing from 2.7 (±3.6) mg/L to 2.06 (±1.91) mg/L, whereas FIBR rose significantly from 2.95 (±0.59) g/L to 3.23 (±1.23) g/L. LDL-C levels decreased slightly, statistically significant, from 129.36 (±40.67) mg/dL to 123.74 (±36.14) mg/dL. HSBB did not affect the levels of evaluated cardiovascular biomarkers, namely NT-proBNP (137.41 (±176.52) pg/mL vs. 142.89 (±182.82) pg/mL; p = 0.477) and cTnT (9.64 (±4.13) vs. 9.65 (±3.91) ng/L; p = 0.948). A multiple regression analysis of pre-balneotherapy and post-balneotherapy values showed cTnT levels to be independently correlated only with CREAT levels and GFR values. None of the assessed parameters independently correlated with the NT-proBNP level. Conclusions: HSBB resulted in a statistically significant improvement in a subclinical pro-inflammatory state. HSBB has a beneficial effect in modifying key cardiovascular risk factors by reducing LDL-C levels and DBP values. HSBB has a neutral effect on cardiovascular ischemia/injury. Despite slightly elevated baseline levels of the biochemical marker of HF (NT-proBNP), HSBB causes no further increase in this marker. The use of HSBB in patients with OAD has either a neutral effect or a potentially beneficial effect on the cardiovascular system, which may constitute grounds for further studies to verify the current cardiovascular contraindications for this form of therapy."

A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PEDro, and Google Scholar. The databases were screened from inception up until April 2024. After screening the scientific literature, 845 articles were retrieved and 17 studies, involving a total of 765 participants, were eventually included in the review. Among them, four were randomized controlled trials, five were non-randomized studies, and eight were pre-post studies with no control group. The evidence gathered in this review indicates a significant short-term reduction in cortisol levels in healthy individuals undergoing balneotherapy, particularly those experiencing high levels of stress. Conversely, in patients with rheumatic conditions (especially if elderly), increases in cortisol levels induced by balneotherapy can act as beneficial hormetic stress, reducing inflammatory mediators and improving pain and functional quality of life. The meta-analysis shows an overall trend of reduction in stress hormone levels, more pronounced in the intervention group undergoing mud-balneotherapy compared to the control group, a finding that, however, does not reach statistical significance (g=-0.11 [95% CI: -0.30; 0.08]; p > 0.05). Current scientific evidence demonstrates that balneotherapy has a positive impact on the regulation of cortisol levels. The regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the beneficial effects observed on health parameters and quality of life allow mud-balneotherapy to be classified as eustressful stimuli useful in preventing stress-related pathologies in healthy individuals and in alleviating symptoms in patients with chronic conditions. Future research on the topic is advised.",

One of the most widely used method in balneotherapy is bathing with thermal mineral water. In the course of the years, scientific community has produced an increasing number of evidences that this practice is an effective method for treating signs and symptoms of several pathologies such as rheumatic, cardiovascular and dermatological diseases. This systematic review is aimed at evaluating the effect of balneotherapy with thermal water baths as a treatment to manage signs and symptoms of patients affected by all types of dermatological diseases. The systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA Statement, and its protocol was registered on PROSPERO platform (CRD42022295913). The research was performed on the databases Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane. We included clinical trials evaluating the effects of balneotherapy using thermal mineral water baths for managing dermatological diseases in humans, published in English and Italian language. Eight studies were included, seven of them enrolled adults affected by psoriasis and one studied atopic dermatitis patients. The common result of all the articles included was a clear improvement of signs and symptoms of psoriasis and eczematous diseases after use of thermal mineral water baths. These effects seem to be strictly related to physical and chemical properties of thermal water used for balneotherapy. However, studies in this field are still limited to support robust evidence of the effectiveness of balneotherapy using thermal mineral water baths and often their quality is low. Thus, new clinical studies need to be carried out, using more correct methods for conducting the studies and for processing statistical data.",

One hundred twenty-three patients treated at Levico Spa Center (Italy) with 12 daily local mud packs and generalized thermal baths were included in this experience. General medical assessments were performed before starting the therapy, at the end of the treatment, and 3 months later. Pain intensity and stiffness were measured by a 0 to 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS); the range of mobility of the lumbar spine was evaluated using the Schober test and functional disability by the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDI). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess the sleep quality. The VAS score for pain and stiffness showed a significant reduction (p < 0.0001) at the end of the treatment persisting for 3 months of follow-up. Similarly, a significant improvement was found for the Schober test and RMDQ. Finally, we showed a significant decrease of PSQI score at the end of the cycle of mud bath and at 3 months of follow-up. The Spearman analysis showed a significant positive correlation between the score of PSQI and VAS pain, VAS stiffness, and RMDQ. In conclusion, this preliminary study confirms the beneficial and long-term efficacy of balneotherapy on pain and function and, for the first one, shows the positive effect on quality of sleep in patients with CLBP treated with a cycle of mud bath therapy."

In France, spa therapy is delivered in spa care facilities (SCF) involving the intervention of several actors (stakeholders). Spa doctors are key stakeholders as they prescribe the treatments, follow spa patients and assess spa therapy with scientific studies. This study aimed to analyze the spa doctors' relationships in order to highlight their role in transferring information to other stakeholders, particularly to spa managers. For that purpose, we used the social network analysis (SNA) method by means of snowball data collection. We sent a questionnaire to all the spa therapy categories of actors. In total, 80 persons answered and declared 397 relationships. Our results, based on the categorization of respondents and of their relationships and on quantitative indicators (density, response rate), show that spa doctors demonstrate a very acceptable density of relations with spa managers and elected local authorities. However, they appear to be poorly involved in relations concerning the strategy and management of SCF, although they are essential actors in ensuring the medical relevance and sustainability of spa therapy. This research is of interest to patients' care as it recommends deeper involvement of spa doctors in the management of SCF in order to optimize access to informational resources, specifically regarding the evolution of treatments in accordance with scientific progress. Our data are of international scope because the organizational model of balneotherapy, based on the cooperation between spa doctors and SCF, is universal."

OBJECTIVE: The comparative analysis of influence of different variants of SCL: balneotherapy and balneotherapy combined with magnetic laser therapy on the dermatological status, IL-4 and IL-13 level, psycho-emotional state and QOL evaluation in patients with true eczema. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 112 patients with true eczema undergoing spa treatment (SCR) (54 in the balneotherapy group and 58 in the balneotherapy group combined with magnetic laser therapy. The effectiveness of SCR was assessed using the EASI, HARS and MADRS scales, and the DLQI questionnaire. The dynamics of IL-4 and IL-13 plasma levels were studied. The duration of the study was 6 months and 14 days. RESULTS: After 14 days of SCR, a statistically significant reduction of the EASI index was more pronounced in the balneotherapy group in combination with MLT compared to the balneotherapy group (p=0.041). Balneotherapy combined with MLT contributed to a statistically significant reduction in the HARS and HDRS scores. The decrease in IL-4 and IL-13 levels was statistically more significant in the balneotherapy group in combination with MLT. The combined use of balneotherapy and MLT in comparison with the balneotherapy group was accompanied by a more pronounced improvement in QOL. The combined use of balneotherapy and MLT in the follow-up phase showed a long-term positive effect: 6 months after completing SCR, the number of patients who had clinical remission was statistically significantly higher than that of the balneotherapy group (87.4% vs 22.5%). CONCLUSION: The combined use of balneotherapy and MLT compared with balneotherapy in patients with true eczema on SCR was shown to be advantageous. The complex application of balneotherapy and MLT decreases inflammatory biomarker scores, improves dermatological and psychoemotional status, QOL parameters and is well tolerated.",

When your blood pressure is high for a long term, it can cause health problems, such as heart disease. In addition to the main methods of treatment, there are various methods of adjuvant therapy, one of the most common of which is hydrotherapy. In this review study, we examined the effects of hydrotherapy, balneotherapy, and spa therapy on blood pressure. We searched the PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and Science Direct databases until April 2022 using related keywords. In summary, the current study shows that different hydrotherapy methods may improve blood pressure. Hydrotherapy as one of the adjunctive therapy methods can be effective in lowering blood pressure. Blood circulation is smoothed by the warmth of the water. This improvement may be achieved by regulating heart rate, releasing hormones that control blood pressure, or regulating the activity of baroreceptors or chemoreceptors. In addition to using medications, hypertension patients also use non-pharmacological approaches in their care, including hydrotherapy, balneotherapy, and warm water foot soaks performed at home. Although several lines of evidence show the potential effects of hydrotherapy, balneotherapy, and spa therapy on blood pressure, many clinical trials are needed.",

Even though Ethiopia has a large number of places with natural hot springs, their therapeutic value has not been thoroughly studied. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of balneotherapy among patients with skin lesions at hot springs in southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A single-arm prospective cohort study design was used to assess patient's progress from their skin lesion complaint after using the hot water for at least three consecutive days or more. An individual visiting the hot springs site and staying there for at least three days or more was included in the study. From four hot springs sites in Southern Ethiopia, 1320 study participants who were 18 years of age or older were enrolled. The data were gathered using a standardized questionnaire and a physical examination. A descriptive analysis was made. RESULTS: Of the total, 142 (10.8%) of them had various skin lesions. Flexural lesions accounted 87 (61.3%), non-specific skin conditions 51 (35.9%), co-lesions at the scalp, external ear canal, trunk, and various locations, and psoriatic lesions comprised 4.8%. There were 72 (82.8%) typical eczematous lesions among the total number of flexural lesions. After using balneotherapy for 3-7 days once daily, 69 (95.2%) cases of eczematous dermatitis and 30 (58.8%) cases of non-specific skin issues showed improvement from the lesion. Additionally, after 30 days of bathing once daily, the PASI score of more than 90% of the psoriatic cases dropped to a score of one. CONCLUSION: Patients with skin lesions benefit significantly from balneotherapy when it lasts for three or more days. In order to improve skin lesions, proper application for at least a week or longer is highly beneficial."

The health-related QoL was evaluated using the following instruments: 5Q-5D-5L, EQ-VAS, EUROHIS-QOL, B-IPQ, and HAQ-DI. The quality of sleep was evaluated by a BaSIQS instrument. Circulating levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured by ELISA and chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay, respectively. The smartband, Xiaomi MI Band 4, was used for real-time sensing of physical activity and sleep quality. MD patients improved the health-related QoL measured by 5Q-5D-5L (p < 0.001), EQ-VAS (p < 0.001), EUROHIS-QOL (p = 0.017), B-IPQ (p < 0.001), and HAQ-DI (p = 0.019) after balneotherapy; the sleep quality was also improved (BaSIQS, p = 0.019). Serum concentrations of IL-6 were markedly decreased after the 14-day balneotherapy (p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were observed regarding the physical activity and sleep quality data recorded by the smartband. Balneotherapy may be an effective alternative treatment in managing the health status of MD patients, with a decrease in inflammatory states, along with positive effects on pain reduction, patient's functionality, QoL, quality of sleep, and disability perception status."

      "abstract": "To preliminarily explore a nondrug intervention method and evaluate its effects (sleep quality, physical examination indicators, and general physical symptoms) on people with sleep disorders. The intervention was based on regular balneotherapy, coupled with targeted health education, appropriate exercise, diet management, and other sleep-promoting measures. It was the combined effects that we evaluated. We recruited 31 volunteers with sleep disorders to receive a 7-day sleep-promoting experience in Tianxing International Hot Spring City, Nanchuan District, Chongqing. The intervention adopted a plan that combined balneotherapy with various sleep-promoting measures. Persisting baths in hot springs 1-2 times per day targeted health lectures about 1 h every morning, appropriate exercise every day (sleep-aid yoga, forest hiking, morning exercises, etc.), and diet management (the principle is to control oil, salt, and sugar, diversify food, keep meat and vegetable balanced, and control total calories. The dinner is light and easy to digest). During the intervention period, all participants followed the above intervention plan, and they lived in the spa resort to accept unified arrangement. This study adopted a self-contrast method by comparing the changes in sleep quality, physical examination indicators, and general physical symptoms before and after the intervention through physical examinations and questionnaire surveys. After the intervention, the subjects' total score of Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) decreased significantly (P = 0.006), and all seven dimensions showed a decrease, four of which included early morning awakening, sleep dissatisfaction, noticeability of sleep problems by others, and distress caused by sleep problems decreased significantly (all P < 0.05). The subjects' body mass index, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, and triglycerides decreased significantly (all P < 0.05), and systolic blood pressure increased significantly (P = 0.006). Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly (all P > 0.05). To some extent, all general health problems were improved than before the intervention (the improvement rate was up to 70% or more). The non-pharmacological intervention of balneotherapy combined with various sleep-promoting measures showed positive effects on sleep quality, general physical symptoms, and some physical examination indicators of sleep disorders. This comprehensive intervention may be an effective way to improve people's health with sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a progressive and common disease that affects the superficial and deep venous systems of the lower limbs. CVI is characterised by valvular incompetence, reflux, venous obstruction or a combination of these symptoms, with consequent distal venous hypertension. Clinical manifestations of CVI include oedema, pain, skin changes, ulcerations and dilated skin veins in the lower limbs. It places a large financial burden on health systems. There is a wide variety of treatment options for CVI, ranging from surgery and medication to compression and physiotherapy. Balneotherapy (treatments involving water) may be a relatively cheap and efficient way to deliver physiotherapy to people with CVI. This is an update of a review first published in 2019. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of balneotherapy for the treatment of people with chronic venous insufficiency. SEARCH METHODS: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 28 June 2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing balneotherapy to no treatment or other types of treatment for CVI. We also included studies that used a combination of treatments. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. disease severity, 2. health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and 3. ADVERSE EFFECTS: Our secondary outcomes were 1. pain, 2. oedema, 3. leg ulcer incidence and 4. skin pigmentation changes. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine randomised controlled trials involving 1126 participants with CVI. Seven studies evaluated balneotherapy versus no treatment, one study evaluated balneotherapy versus a phlebotonic drug (melilotus officinalis), and one study evaluated balneotherapy versus dryland exercises. We downgraded our certainty in the evidence due to a lack of blinding of participants and investigators, participant-reported outcomes and imprecision. Balneotherapy versus no treatment Balneotherapy compared to no treatment probably results in slightly improved disease severity signs and symptoms scores as assessed by the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS; mean difference (MD) -1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.02 to -0.49; 3 studies, 671 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared to no treatment may improve HRQoL as assessed by the Chronic Venous Insufficiency Quality of Life Questionnaire 2 (CIVIQ2) at three months, but we are very uncertain about the results (MD -10.46, 95% CI -19.21 to -1.71; 2 studies, 153 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The intervention may improve HRQoL at 12 months (MD -4.48, 95% CI -8.61 to -0.36; 2 studies, 417 participants; low-certainty evidence). It is unclear if the intervention has an effect at six months (MD -2.99, 95% CI -6.53 to 0.56; 2 studies, 436 participants; low-certainty evidence) or nine months (MD -6.40, 95% CI -13.84 to 1.04; 1 study, 59 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared with no treatment may have little or no effect on the occurrence of adverse effects. The main adverse effects were thromboembolic events (odds radio (OR) 0.35, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.42; 3 studies, 584 participants; low-certainty evidence), erysipelas (OR 2.58, 95% CI 0.65 to 10.22; 2 studies, 519 participants; low-certainty evidence) and palpitations (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.52; 1 study, 59 participants; low-certainty evidence). No studies reported any serious adverse effects. Balneotherapy compared with no treatment may improve pain scores slightly at three months (MD -1.12, 95% CI -1.35 to -0.88; 2 studies, 354 participants; low-certainty evidence); and six months (MD -1.02, 95% CI -1.25 to -0.78; 2 studies, 352 participants; low-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared with no treatment may have little or no effect on oedema (measured by leg circumference) at 24 days to three months, but we are very uncertain about the results (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.32 cm, 95% CI -0.70 to 1.34; 3 studies, 369 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared with no treatment may have little or no effect on the incidence of leg ulcers at 12 months, but we are very uncertain about the results (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.27 to 4.14; 2 studies, 449 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared with no treatment may slightly reduce skin pigmentation changes as measured by the pigmentation index at 12 months (MD -3.60, 95% CI -5.95 to -1.25; 1 study, 59 participants; low-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy versus melilotus officinalis For the comparison balneotherapy versus a phlebotonic drug (melilotus officinalis), there was little or no difference in pain symptoms (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.87; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or oedema (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.27; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but we are very uncertain about the results. The study reported no other outcomes of interest. Balneotherapy versus dryland exercise For the comparison balneotherapy versus dryland exercise, evidence from one study showed that balneotherapy may improve HRQoL as assessed by the Varicose Vein Symptom Questionnaire (VVSymQ), but we are very uncertain about the results (MD -3.00, 95% CI -3.80 to -2.20; 34 participants, very low-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared with dryland exercises may reduce oedema (leg volume) after five sessions of treatment (right leg: MD -840.70, 95% CI -1053.26 to -628.14; left leg: MD -767.50, 95% CI -910.07 to -624.93; 1 study, 34 participants, low-certainty evidence). The study reported no other outcomes of interest. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: For the comparison balneotherapy versus no treatment, we identified moderate-certainty evidence that the intervention improves disease severity signs and symptoms scores slightly, low-certainty evidence that it improves pain and skin pigmentation changes, and very low-certainty evidence that it improves HRQoL. Balneotherapy compared with no treatment made little or no difference to adverse effects, oedema or incidence of leg ulcers. Evidence comparing balneotherapy with other interventions was very limited. To ensure adequate comparison between trials, future trials should standardise measurements of outcomes (e.g. disease severity signs and symptoms score, HRQoL, pain and oedema) and follow-up time points.",

This pilot study aimed to determine the effectiveness of balneotherapy for chronic LBP in people > 60 years old and to determine profiles of responders with trajectory model analysis. This was a pilot prospective open cohort study, with repeated measurements using validated questionnaires; participants were their own controls. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with a change in pain intensity between the start of treatment and 3 months after treatment assessed with a numeric scale (NS) from 0 to 100 mm, with an effect size (ES) > 0.5. The assessments involved questionnaires that were self-administered on days (D) 1 and 21 and at months 3 and 6. The secondary objective was to determine the profile of responders to balneotherapy. We included 78 patients (69.2% women), mean age 68.3 ± 5.3 years. The mean pain score on the NS was 48.8 ± 19.9 at D1 and 39.1 ± 20.5 at 3 months (p < 0.001). The ES was 0.47 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25 to 0.69] for the whole sample; 36% (28/78) had an ES > 0.5; 23% (18/78) had a moderate ES (0 to 0.5); and 41% (32/78) had an ES of zero (14/78) or < 0 (18/78), corresponding to increased pain intensity. The pain trajectory model showed that the change in pain between D1 and D21 for trajectory A (larger reduction in pain intensity) was -50% [95% CI -60 to -27], and for trajectory B (smaller reduction in pain intensity), it was -13% [-33 to 0] (p < 0.001). Between Day 1 and month 3, the change for trajectory A was -33% [-54; 0] and for trajectory B was -13% [-40 to 0] (p = 0.14). Finally, between D1 and month 6, the change for trajectory A was -50% [-60 to 0] and for trajectory B was -6% [-33 to 17] (p = 0.007). The patients in trajectory A reported performing more physical activity than those in trajectory B (p = 0.04). They were also less disabled, with a mean Oswestry Disability Index of 40.4 versus 45.7 for those in trajectory A and B, respectively, (p = 0.03) and had a higher total Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale score. This real-life study of the effectiveness of balneotherapy on chronic LBP identified distinct pain trajectories and predictive variables for responders. These criteria could be used in decision-making regarding the prescription of balneotherapy, to ensure personalized management of chronic LBP.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: Despite remission or low disease activity non-inflammatory complaints like exhaustion, fatigue, and pain persist in a significant proportion of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and have a considerable impact on health-related quality of life. This study evaluated the effects of balneotherapy on non-inflammatory complaints, quality of life, and work productivity of patients with SLE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: SLE patients in remission/low disease activity in three rheumatology centers were included in this randomized, controlled, follow-up study. In addition to the standard of care (SOC), sixteen out of the thirty patients with SLE received balneotherapy (3-week period, 15 times, for 30 min) and fourteen patients received the SOC only. Pre-validated survey instruments including Lupus Quality of Life (LupusQoL), Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), Work Productivity, and Activity Impairment-Lupus (WPAI-Lupus) questionnaires were used. RESULTS: Based on the SF-36 questionnaires, several subdomains of physical condition improved significantly after the course; the improvement remained durable (p=0.019). General health improved significantly by the end of the course (p=0.001). According to the LupusQoL questionnaire, physical health and pain showed a tendency of improvement shortly after the spa treatment. Changes in the WPAI-lupus questionnaire indicated a short-term improvement of the daily activity by the end of the observation period. No adverse reactions were observed. CONCLUSION: Thermal water therapy may be an effective, well-tolerated, complementary non-pharmacological approach for non-inflammatory complaints of patients with SLE. Physical condition improved in the short-term, whereas fatigue worsened despite treatment.",

METHODS: Forty-six participants (n = 22, between 18 and 35 years of age as young adults; n = 24, more than 65 years of age as older adults) with musculoskeletal disorders admitted to physiotherapy therapy sessions with balneotherapy were enrolled. The participants' immersion time was 20 minutes each during 10 sessions occurring over the course of 2 weeks. Blood pressure and pulse were measured at the baseline and the 5th minute as acute responses, and at the baseline and the 30th minute as recovery responses during the first and 10th sessions. RESULTS: First, the group and session effect was examined. There was no significance in this part. Then, session main effect and group main effect were examined. The group main effect was significant, that is, a difference was found between groups independent of the session in terms of only pulse values (P < .001). There was no difference in sessions. The acute and recovery responses of the pulse at the first and 10th sessions of balneotherapy showed higher alterations in the young people compared with the older people (P < .008). CONCLUSION: Greater pulse alterations at the acute and recovery phases of the first and 10th sessions were observed in young adults."

This review aims to assess whether balneotherapy can improve sleep quality in concomitance or not with exercise. The research was conducted on Medline, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. The current review followed PRISMA reporting guidelines and involves twenty-one articles grouped into four sections based on the characteristics of the balneotherapy protocol: 1.a Balneotherapy-thermal water immersion alone (five studies); 1.b Balneotherapy-thermal water immersion with other spa treatments (six studies); 2.a Balneotherapy and physical exercise-balneotherapy and out-of-the-pool physical exercise (eight studies); 2.b Balneotherapy and physical exercise-balneotherapy and in-pool physical exercise (three studies). Apart from healthy or sub-healthy subjects, patients recruited in the studies were affected by fibromyalgia, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, musculoskeletal pain, subacute supraspinatus tendinopathy, and mental disorders. Duration, number of sessions, and study protocols are very different from each other. Only one study objectively evaluated sleep, whereas the others used subjective sleep assessment methods. Eight studies considered sleep as a primary outcome and ten as secondary. Sixteen out of twenty-one studies described improvements in self-perceived sleep quality. Thus, balneotherapy associated with other spa treatments and physical exercise seems to be effective in improving self-perceived sleep quality. However, the miscellany of treatments makes it difficult to discern the isolated effects of balneotherapy and physical exercise. Future studies should consider using an objective sleep assessment method and describing the pathways and physiological mechanisms that could provoke sleep changes during balneotherapy treatments."

RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements in the BASDAI, BASFI, MASES, BASMI, ASQoL, FSS, and ASDAS-CRP scores were observed in all groups at 4 and 12 weeks of follow-up (p<0.05). A significant improvement in sleep latency was seen in the balneotherapy and WBE groups. Changes in SSL were not statistically significant in any group (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Balneotherapy, WBE, and LBE are effective in the treatment of AS, and the beneficial effects may last for at least 12 weeks."

METHODS: Two authors independently searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE and WEB OF SCIENCE databases until July 2017, for randomized controlled trials published in French or English, that included participants, and interventions: adults with spondyloarthritis, treated by balneotherapy program or one of its components and compared with any other intervention or no treatment. Internal validity, external validity, quality of the statistical analysis, and publication bias were systematically evaluated. We report the best level of evidence. RESULTS: Nine articles were selected; the internal validity was high in two studies, average in one study, and low in six studies. With high internal validity, one study found a difference for pain between immersion in radon-rich water and tap water for the whole population or rheumatic disease, but the BASFI is not improved for the subgroup of patients with spondyloarthritis. The other study with high validity reported a significant 28-week improvement in quality of life and a composite index. In a study with moderate internal validity involving ankylosing spondylitis patients with associated with inflammatory bowel disease, a balneotherapy program demonstrated a relevant clinical improvement when compared to patients on waiting list. With low internal validity, TNFa inhibitors+spa therapy were found to be superior to a treatment with TNFa inhibitors alone in patients with psoriatic arthritis. CONCLUSIONS: Two trials with high validity demonstrated improvements, but this systematic review is not sufficient to prove the efficacy of balneotherapy in spondyloarthritis. More trials are needed with larger sample size to confirm the preliminary results observed and conclusively determine the benefits of balneotherapy.",

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic study was to evaluate the evidence obtained from human studies on the effects of hydrotherapy, spa therapy, and balneotherapy in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. METHODS: The present systematic review was conducted according to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statements. Also, for this study databases such as Embase, PubMed, Scopus ProQuest, and sciences direct database were searched from the beginning to April 2021. RESULTS: All human studies that examined the effect of balneotherapy, spa therapy, and hydrotherapy on psoriasis and atopic dermatitis were published in the form of a full article in English. In the end, only 22 of the 424 articles met the criteria for analysis. Most studies have shown that balneotherapy, spa therapy, and hydrotherapy may reduce the effects of the disease by reducing inflammation and improving living conditions. In addition, the results of the Downs and Black score show that seven studies received very good scores, three studies received good scores, nine studies received fair scores, and three studies received poor scores. CONCLUSIONS: The results of studies also showed that hydrotherapy leads to an improvement in the PASI score index. Nevertheless, more clinical trials are needed to determine the mechanism of action of hydrotherapy on these diseases.",

Yet, a systematic review for the evidence of water therapy including all cancer entities has not been conducted to date. PURPOSE: Oncological patients often suffer from symptoms which in patients with other diseases are successfully treated with water therapy. We want to gather more information about the benefits and risks of water therapy for cancer patients. METHOD: In May 2020, a systematic search was conducted searching five electronic databases (Embase, Cochrane, PsychInfo, CINAHL and PubMed) to find studies concerning the use, effectiveness and potential harm of water therapy on cancer patients. RESULTS: Of 3165 search results, 10 publications concerning 12 studies with 430 patients were included in this systematic review. The patients treated with water therapy were mainly diagnosed with breast cancer. The therapy concepts included aqua lymphatic therapy, aquatic exercises, foot bathes and whole-body bathes. Outcomes were state of lymphedema, quality of life, fatigue, BMI, vital parameters, anxiety and pain. The quality of the studies was assessed with the AMSTAR2-instrument, the SIGN-checklist and the IHE-Instruments. The studies had moderate quality and reported heterogeneous results. Some studies reported significantly improved quality of life, extent of lymphedema, neck and shoulder pain, fatigue and BMI while other studies did not find any changes concerning these endpoints. CONCLUSION: Due to the very heterogeneous results and methodical limitations of the included studies, a clear statement regarding the effectiveness of water therapy on cancer patients is not possible.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Balneotherapy (BT) is the treatment of disease through the use of thermal spring water (TSW). It has been used for centuries and remains a popular form of treatment for dermatologic diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD). Recent findings highlighted the role of the gut microbiota in AD and the possible crosstalk between gut and skin microbiomes in this pathology. Nevertheless, changes in the composition of the gut microbiota after balneotherapy remain to be elucidated. METHODS: A total of 96 patients, with moderate to severe AD according to the SCORAD, were enrolled. Stool samples were collected prior and post a 3-week balneotherapy at the thermal care center of La Roche-Posay (France). Composition of the gut microbiota was assessed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. RESULTS: Species associated with high gut microbiota richness tended to correlate negatively with disease severity (SCORAD) and positively with SCORAD reduction, while species associated with low richness displayed the opposite pattern. Relative abundance of 23 species was significantly altered during BT, these changes being significantly associated with SCORAD reduction during BT, suggesting that gut microbiota composition and AD progression were associated through the treatment. Microbial functions related to gut-brain axis such as GABA and tryptophan metabolism were also altered by the treatment. Long-standing AD patients exhibited a better gut microbial profile than recently diagnosed patients, with higher MSP richness and species associated with SCORAD reduction. CONCLUSION: In patients with AD, clinical disease parameters such as SCORAD or disease duration are intricately linked to the gut microbiota composition. SCORAD reduction occurring during BT was also associated with gut microbiota. The gut-brain-skin axis via neurotransmitter such as GABA should be further studied in diseases such as AD."

Among the available forms of treatment, balneotherapy seems to be one of the most common forms of nonpharmacological treatment for rheumatic disease. The aim was to explore the effectiveness of balneotherapy for improving the quality of life of patients with RA. METHODS: Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science and The Cochrane library were searched for randomized or clinical controlled trials published in English or Spanish until May 2021. Risk of bias of included articles were assessed using the Cochrane tool. A total 535 records were retrieved, and seven met the inclusion criteria. All the included studies showed statistically significant improvements in the quality of life of patients who received balneotherapy treatment despite differences in treatment administration. Sessions should be approximately 20 min long and use natural mineral waters enriched with elements, or mud, at a water temperature between 35-38 °C. CONCLUSIONS: Balneotherapy benefits the quality of life of people with RA. The obtained results show positive effects for both mineral bathing and immersion in sand or mud on the quality of life of people who suffer from RA.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of balneotherapy on musculoskeletal disorder pain and its perceived improvement among users of hot spring water in Southern Ethiopia. Methods: A single-arm cohort study and convenient sampling method were used to select 1337 study participants from four hot springs in Southern Ethiopia. A structured questionnaire, a physical examination, and laboratory blood tests were used to collect data. Data were entered using Epi data and transferred to SPSS 25 for cleaning and analysis. Descriptive analysis was made. Results: A total of 1279 participants were included in the study, giving a response rate of 96%. The majority of these patients have multiple health problems. Of all, 1137 (88.9%) of the patients were visiting the hot springs for joint pain followed by muscle pain 669 (52.2). Out of all cases of joint pain, 132 (11.6%) were clinically diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, and 5.3% were confirmed as having the disease based on a laboratory test. Of the total number of study participants, 1064 (83.2%) reported complete relief from the complaints they had at the start of the bath. Conclusions: Hot spring baths for three and more days have significant therapeutic effects on patients with musculoskeletal disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis. Physicians who are currently working in the area of diagnosis and treatment of patients in government and public facilities of the southern region should consider hot spring bath treatment for those patients with complaints of musculoskeletal pain, nonspecific arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. A hot spring bath is beneficial for everyone because it is a natural treatment with few side effects and a low cost.",

There is not enough information about how changes in body temperature, duration, and frequency of exposure to heat affect therapeutic outcomes of balneotherapeutic applications. Body core temperature (BCT) is probably the best parameter for expressing the heat load of the body and can be used to describe the causal relationship between heat exposure and its effects. There are several reasons to take BCT changes into account; for example, it can be used for individualized treatment planning, defining the consequences of thermal effects, developing disease-specific approaches, avoiding adverse effects, and designing clinical trials. The reasons why BCT changes should be considered instead of conventional measures will be discussed while explaining the effects of balneotherapy in this article, along with a discussion of BCT measurement in balneotherapy practice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is an important musculoskeletal condition results in clinical, social and public health problems globally. Hydrotherapy, using water and heat together can be utilized to treat conditions, relieve pain and increase muscular power and a range of joint movement in patients with chronic lower back pain. Most patients with acute LBP improve spontaneously within four weeks; however, chronic LBP is extremely common and usually mechanical in nature. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the current study was to assess effect of balneotherapy in decreasing the lower back pain and its improvements among adults using a spa in southern Ethiopia. METHODS: We employed a single arm cohort study and convenient sampling method to select 442 study participants from four hot springs located in Sidama Region and Gedeo Zone, Southern Ethiopia. Structured and pretested questionnaire was used and administered face-to-face by trained data collectors. Data were entered using EpiData and transferred to SPSS for cleaning and analysis. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were made. RESULTS: A total of 427 participants were included in the study giving response rate of 96.6%. The mean (standard deviation) age of respondents was 42.55 (±14.92) years. Perceived improvement from back pain was 332 (77.8%) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of 74-82%. Factors showing association with perceived improvement from back pain after spa therapy were, study site being near Hawassa (Burkitu) with crude odds ratio (COR) of 3.3 and 95%CI: 1.83-5.98 and p-value <0.001; and sex of respondents that the odds of perceived improvements among males were about twofold compared with females, (COR: 1.7, 95%CI: 1.07-2.74, p-value 0.025. CONCLUSION: Our study shows significant perceived improvement from back pain after utilization of spa water. This is associated with type of hot spring used, male sex, and having neurological symptoms. Therefore, hot spring spa water had better therapeutic effect for back pain and emphasis should be given to integrate it with modern medicine and further experimental study to be conducted to recommend it for medical purposes."

Therefore, we aimed to exploit Google Trends analysis, as a measure of peoples' interest in balneotherapy, in two countries, Italy and Japan. In this infodemiology study, Google Trends was queried for the lay terms widely used by the Italian population to refer to the balneotherapy setting (terme + termale) and by the Japanese to refer to the bathing place and balneotherapy facilities ( + スパ). The internet searches in 2020 were compared to overlapping time spans in 2016-2019 and were correlated with new confirmed cases/deaths. This study demonstrated that from February 23 to June 20, 2020, and from October 4 to December 26, 2020, the internet searches of the Italian words corresponding to balneotherapy were statistically significantly decreased; however, the internet searches were not significantly different in June 21 to October 3, 2020, compared to overlapping time spans in 2016-2019 in Italy. The study also showed that from March 15 to September 5, 2020, and from November 29 to December 26, 2020, the internet searches of the Japanese words corresponding to balneotherapy were statistically significantly decreased; however, the internet searches were significantly increased in September 13 to November 7, 2020, and were not significantly different in November 8 to 28, 2020, compared to overlapping time spans in 2016-2019 in Japan. There were significant negative correlations between the relative search volume and number of new cases (rho=-0.634; p<0.001)/deaths (rho=-0.856; p<0.001) in Italy and the number of new deaths (rho=-0.348; p=0.012) in Japan. Population interest in balneotherapy has changed in the COVID-19 era both in Italy and Japan. During the early stage of pandemic (March to June), the interest was lower. After this early stage, the interest showed a recovery in both countries. In Italy, the population interest reached to its prior levels in late June through early October, with a peak in August. In Japan, the recovery exceeded the prior 4-year levels in mid-September through early November. Then, both countries demonstrated a decline in interest: began in early October in Italy and late November in Japan. This information would allow us to understand/address the population response in the pandemic in respect of the balneotherapy and would guide the preparedness of healthcare providers and planners both in this pandemic and future similar situations.",

Recently, preclinical models and clinical trials have been developed to study the effects of BT on the immune system. This review summarizes the currently available evidence regarding the effects of spa therapy on the immune response, to confirm the role of BT in the enhancement of immune system and open interesting research fields. METHODS: PubMed and Google Scholar were searched from 1997 up to June 2020, with search criteria including terms related to BT and immune system. We selected only in vitro research, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or clinical trials. RESULTS: In vitro studies on human and animal samples have demonstrated that thermal waters exert anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. In particular, H2S donors seem to counteract the inflammatory processes in psoriatic lesions, arthritic fibroblast-like synoviocytes and chondrocytes, and regulate important factors implicated in osteoarthritis pathogenesis and progression. RCTs and clinical trials revealed, after BT, a reduction in circulating levels of pro-inflammatory molecules, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and C-reactive protein, and an increase in anti-inflammatory molecules such as the IGF-1 growth factor especially in musculoskeletal diseases. CONCLUSION: Further preclinical studies and RCTs could help to exploit BT in real life for preventive and therapeutic treatments."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several studies have investigated the efficacy of balneotherapy in atopic dermatitis (AD), including a pediatric open randomized clinical trial conducted at the Comano thermal spring water center, which showed a significant reduction in AD severity and an improvement of the quality of life. However, so far many studies on balneotherapy in pediatric AD have included relatively small populations without identifying patients' characteristics associated with their response. The aim of the present study was to identify any features associated with the clinical response to the Comano thermal spring water balneotherapy in a large cohort of pediatric AD patients. METHODS: An observational study was conducted on 867 children aged ≤16 years (females 50.5%, mean patient's age 5.9 years, standard deviation ±3.6 years) with mild to severe AD who underwent balneotherapy at the Comano thermal spring water center (Comano, Trentino, Italy) from April to October 2014. Patients were stratified according to their disease severity, which was evaluated using five SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) categories before and immediately after a thermal spring water balneotherapy course. Potential characteristics associated with the patients' clinical response to Comano thermal spring water balneotherapy were investigated. RESULTS: A statistically significant improvement in AD severity was observed after Comano thermal spring water balneotherapy (p < 0.0001). A significantly higher percentage of patients achieving improvement in AD severity was reported among children ≤4 years old (p < 0.0001) with early-onset AD (p < 0.0001), severe AD (p < 0.0001) or coexistent reported food allergies (p < 0.01). The therapy was well tolerated, and no relevant adverse effects were reported during the treatment course. CONCLUSIONS: Comano thermal spring water balneotherapy is a safe complementary treatment for pediatric patients with AD, as it was able to reduce the disease severity, especially in children ≤4 years old, with early onset AD, severe AD or concomitant food allergies.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five females (mean age 39.9±5.8 years; range, 18 to 50 years) with fibromyalgia and 35 healthy females (mean age 37.9±6.6 years; range, 18 to 50 years) were included in the study. The TAS, TOS, and OSI of patients with FMS and healthy controls were measured. Disease severity was evaluated using the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, pain levels were evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS), mood was evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and quality of life was evaluated using the Short Form 36 (SF-36). Patients with FMS were given 15 sessions of balneotherapy. After treatment, the laboratory and clinical parameters of the patients were reevaluated. RESULTS: Although the TAS levels of patients with FMS were not significantly different from those of the control group (p=0.114), the TOS and OSI levels were higher than those of the control group (p<0.001). The VAS, BDI, and SF-36 parameter scores of patients with FMS were significantly higher than those of the control group (p<0.001). A statistically significant decrease (p<0.001) in TOS and OSI levels of patients with FMS was detected after balneotherapy; however, the TAS levels of patients with FMS did not change significantly (p=0.538). All clinical parameters showed significant improvement with balneotherapy (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: An oxidative disorder was detected in patients with FMS compared with the control group. Balneotherapy showed antioxidant activity and decreased oxidative stress while also improving clinical parameters and quality of life."

Its treatment is based on a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, but the role of these latter is still debated. This overview of systematic reviews aimed at evaluating the short-term efficacy of different thermal modalities in patients with osteoarthritis. We searched PubMed, Scopus, CINHAL, Web of Science, ProQuest and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception until October 2020, with no language restrictions. We selected the following outcomes a priori: pain, stiffness and quality of life. Seventeen systematic reviews containing 27 unique relevant studies were included. The quality of the reviews ranged from low to critically low. Substantial variations in terms of interventions studied, comparison groups, population, outcomes and follow-up between the included SRs were found. From a re-analysis of primary data, emerged that balneotherapy was effective in reducing pain and improving stiffness and quality of life, mud therapy significantly reduced pain and stiffness, and spa therapy showed pain relief. However, the evidence supporting the efficacy of different thermal modalities could be seriously flawed due to methodological quality and sample size, to the presence of important treatment variations, and to the high level of heterogeneity and the absence of a double-blind design. There is some encouraging evidence that deserves clinicians' consideration, suggesting that thermal modalities are effective on a short-term basis for treating patients with AO.",

MATERIALS AND METHOD: This prospective, controlled, single blind study was conducted. Patients were randomized into two groups through a simple randomization in a 1:1 ratio. The clinician and biostatistics expert were blinded. PT group was applied PT, BT + PT group was applied PT + BT. All patients were included in the study for 3 weeks (total of 15 sessions, 5 days per week). All patients applied hot pack, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and ultrasound. Patients in the BT + PT group applied BT in thermo mineralized water pool (20 min at 38-40 °C). Assessments were made using Pain-Visual Analog Scale(VAS), EQ-5D-3 L Scale(EQ5), EQ-VAS, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue(FACIT-F), Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire(RMDQ) and Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale(QBPDS) at the beginning (W0) and end (W3) of treatment. While performing statistical analysis, patients were divided into 3 categories of BMI1(18.5-24.9 kg/m2), BMI2 (25.0-29.9 kg/m2) and BMI3(≥30.0 kg/m2). RESULTS: 270 patients were randomized. 129 patients in PT group and 133 patients in PT + BT group completed the study. In the BT + PT group, there were increases in the EQ5 and EQ-VAS variables and decreases in all other variables compared to the PT group which were found to be statistically significant (for QBPDS p < 0.05, the others p < 0.01). The differences in all variables W0 and W3 were at least half reductions and increases which were found to be statistically significant (p < 0.01). In terms of BMI, there were significant differences for all groups, especially BMI3 had higher means for all variables apart from EQ5 and EQ-VAS than the other two categories. BMI1 was the BMI category with highest means for EQ5 and EQ-VAS. The Group × Time interaction was found to be statistically significant for Pain-VAS, EQ5, EQ-VAS, FACIT-F, QBPDS and RMDQ(p < 0.01). For Pain-VAS, the effect of the Group × Time × BMI interaction was found to be statistically significant(p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: BT plus PT was more effective than PT. BT may have positive contributions to reducing pain, functionality of patients, quality of life, fatigue and disability status.",

Ninety patients with subacute supraspinatus tendinopathy were included. They were randomized into two equal groups. In group 1 (n = 45), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), hot pack, ultrasound treatments, and Codman's and range of motion (ROM) exercises were performed. In group 2 (n = 45), balneotherapy was added to the treatment program. In both groups, shoulder active ROM and handgrip strength were measured. Pain was evaluated using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (rest, sleep, movement); functional assessment and quality of life were measured respectively with the Shortened Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire (QuickDASH), and the Short Form-36 health survey (SF 36) form. All measurements were repeated before and after 15 treatment sessions. There were statistically significant differences between the before and after assessment parameters in group 1 (all p < 0.05), but not for SF-36 General Health Perceptions, SF-36 Mental Health sub-parameters, and handgrip strengths. However, there were statistically significant differences between all the evaluation before and after the treatment in group 2 (all p < 0.05). When the two groups were compared in terms of alpha gains, statistically significant differences were observed in favor of group 2 in all measurements (all p < 0.05) except for SF-36 Emotional Role Difficulty and SF-36 Mental Health sub-parameters. This study shows that the addition of balneotherapy to physical therapy for subacute supraspinatus tendinopathy can make additional contributions to shoulder ROM, pain, handgrip strength, functional status, and quality of life.",

A three-way mixed ANOVA was conducted to determine the effects of two between-subjects´ factors (intervention group and caregiver type) and one within-subjects´ factor (time) on burden, depression, anxiety, maladjustment and care satisfaction. Results showed less burden and more care satisfaction in both primary and secondary caregivers participating in the BT-PE program after the interventions. Primary caregivers also showed lower levels of maladjustment in the experimental group at post-intervention. Although depressive symptoms and anxiety decreased significantly in both intervention groups, BT-PE did not show lower scores compared with the application of sole BT. The relevance of caregivers´ psychoeducation on the balanced care model and its combination with balneotherapy is highlighted.",

METHODS: Eligible studies were systematic reviews based on randomized controlled trials with meta-analysis that included at least one group treated with BT or ST. We searched the following databases for articles published in English from the year 2000 to 20 November 2019: Cochrane Database Systematic Review, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Ichushi-Web. RESULTS: Eighteen studies met all inclusion criteria. Based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11, among these 18 studies, 8 (44%) were about \"#15 Diseases of the musculoskeletal system or connective tissue\", 5 (28%) were about \"#21 Symptoms, signs or clinical findings, not elsewhere classified\", 4 (22%) were about \"#11 Diseases of the circulatory system\", and 1 study (6%) was about \"#8 Diseases of the nervous system\". Both BT and ST provided significant pain relief and improved quality of life in chronic diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissues. Additionally, BT and ST with exercise under water improved physical fitness and function in patients across diseases. CONCLUSION: Researchers need to conduct studies on the treatment of many kinds of potential diseases using the keywords of pain relief and QoL. In addition, depending on patients' symptoms, physical fitness, and disabilities, performing exercise under water may improve treatment effects on physical function and fitness."

The aim of this preliminary study is to retrospectively evaluate the symptomatic effects of a cycle of mud-bath therapy in HOA patients. Two hundred twelve outpatients with primary bilateral HOA treated with 12 daily local mud packs and generalized thermal baths with a sulfurous-arsenical-ferruginous mineral water added to usual treatment were included in the study. Each patient was examined at baseline and at the end of thermal therapy (2 weeks). Primary outcome measures were global spontaneous hand pain on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Functional Index for Hand Osteoarthritis (FIHOA) score; secondary outcomes were handgrip strength, duration of morning stiffness, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), tolerability and patients' and physicians' global impression of treatment efficacy and tolerability. Our results demonstrated that the efficacy of mud-bath therapy was significant in all the assessed parameters at the end of therapy, except for the physical component score of SF-12. The thermal treatment was well tolerated. The patient's and the physician's global assessments showed a high level of satisfaction in terms of efficacy and safety. In conclusion, our results may suggest a short-term effectiveness of mud-bath therapy in controlling pain and improving functionality in HOA patients, supporting the role of this treatment as a complementary strategy in the management of HOA; however, further randomized controlled trials with a long-term follow-up are needed.",

Thus, we examined the effects of JMS bathing on knee OA and the combination effects with diclofenac sodium as an anti-inflammatory drug. Knee OA was induced by transection of the anterior cruciate ligament and the partial meniscectomy in rat. The rats were administered subcutaneously saline or diclofenac sodium in saline, followed by bathing in thermal distilled water or JMS for 8 weeks. The model represented the characteristic changes of the cartilage degradation, osteophyte formation and synovial inflammation, and the relevant symptoms of the joint swelling and stiffness. However, the JMS bathing reduced the joint thickness and improved the mobility. It also contributed to a well-preserved tissue supported by increases in bone mineral density of the joint and decreases in Mankin scores in the cartilages. The effects involved anti-inflammation, chondroprotection, anti-apoptosis, and chondrogenesis. Overall, the JMS bathing in combination with diclofenac sodium showed a similar trend associated with synergic effects. It suggests that JMS bathing can be promising for a clinical use in knee OA.",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis of the knee joint is a public health concern with considerable social impacts and related-costs. Among the treatments available, several benefits of bathing in natural mineral water have been proposed: (1) to identify possible health benefits (in terms of effects on dimensions of pain, functionality, emotional and social aspects, and quality of life) of a 3-week balneotherapy intervention in patients with knee osteoarthritis; (2) to assess the clinical relevance of any benefits detected; and (3) to determine if these effects persist. Participants of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) were 120 patients randomly assigned to (1) an experimental group (3 weeks of balneotherapy consisting of daily whirlpool baths, hydrokinesitherapy sessions, and knee shower/massages) or (2) control group in which no form of treatment apart from their usual analgesia medication was given. Treatment benefits were assessed using the following tools: (1) visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain, (2) Timed Up & Go Test (TUG), (3) WOMAC osteoarthritis questionnaire, and (4) SF 36 health survey questionnaire. In the experimental group, these tests were conducted immediately before treatment, immediately after treatment, and at 3 months of follow-up. Patients assigned to the control group were assessed at the study start and 3 months later. Data processing and statistical analysis were performed using the SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science) version 22.0. Out of 60 patients in the experimental group, 45 were found to benefit from the treatment intervention in terms of pain relief among other aspects, and also when test scores were compared to those obtained in the control group. Improvements were often clinical relevant and in most patients persisted 3 months after treatment onset.",

Two hundred psoriasis vulgaris patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis from January 2013 to June 2014 were evenly divided into two groups: the consolidated therapy group (CTG) and unconsolidated therapy group (UTG); the remission period of the two groups was compared. There was no significant difference in Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score between the two groups at the beginning and the end of the treatment. However, the average remission time in CTG was 10.99 months, which was significantly longer than that of 7.94 months in UTG (P = .001). After a correction of age, course of disease, skin type as well as PASI baseline value using a COX model, we found that the risk of recurrence of psoriasis vulgaris in UTG was higher than that in the CTG (P < .001). No adverse reactions were discovered when combing the two treatments together. The combined treatment of CHM balneotherapy and narrowband ultraviolet B could significantly prolong the remission time in patients with psoriasis vulgaris.",

OBJECTIVE: This study intended to investigate the effects of BT on pain, disability, and quality of life for patients with chronic shoulder pain. DESIGN: The research team designed a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blinded study. SETTING: The study took place in the Department of Medical Ecology and Hydroclimatology at the Bolu İzzet Baysal Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Training and Research Hospital (Bolu, Turkey). PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 60 patients with shoulder pain who were admitted to the outpatient clinic at the hospital between April 2016 and September 2016. INTERVENTION: Participants were divided randomly into 2 groups: a control group receiving physical therapy (PT) only, the PT group, and an intervention group receiving PT plus BT, the BT group. All participants received 3 wk of treatment. OUTCOME MEASURES: The study measured pain, disability, and quality of life using a visual analogue scale (VAS), the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), and the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) at baseline, immediately postintervention, and at 1 mo postintervention. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were found on the VAS, SPADI, and NHP at both postintervention timepoints for both groups compared with baseline (P < .05). When the difference scores were compared between the groups, the BT group showed significantly greater improvements at both postintervention timepoints for the VAS and SPADI compared with the PT group (P < .05). For the NHP, the BT group showed significantly greater improvements compared with the PT group immediately postintervention for the pain and energy level subscales and for the total score (P < .05). At 1 mo postintervention, the BT group again showed significantly greater improvements on the NHP compared the PT group for the pain, physical activity, energy level, and sleep subscales and for the total score (P < .05). CONCLUSION: The results of the study suggest that BT can have positive effects on pain and disability. BT may be an alternative for patients with chronic shoulder pain.",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic joint disease that results in progressive cartilage destruction and subsequently joint dysfunction. Growing evidence indicates beneficial impact of balneological interventions in OA; however, their mechanisms of action are still unclear. Here, we evaluate the effect of balneotherapy in sulfurous water in an OA experimental model. Experimental OA was induced in Wistar rats by transection of the medial collateral ligament and removal of the medial meniscus of the left knee. Animals were randomized into three groups: non-treated (control) and balneotherapy using sulfurous water (SW) or tap water (TW). Macroscopic evaluation was performed, as well as evaluation of pain levels and analysis of motor function by rotarod test. Histopathological changes in articular cartilage and synovium were also evaluated. The presence of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and oxidative damage markers was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Joint destabilization induced joint thickening, loss of joint flexion, and increased levels of pain. At day 40, animals from SW group presented lower pain levels than those from control group. Experimental OA also affected motor function. Balneotherapy in sulfur-rich water significantly improved joint mobility in relation to that in tap water. Besides, we observed that cartilage deterioration was lower in SW group than in the other two groups. Likewise, SW group showed reduced levels of MMP-13 in the cartilage. Conversely, we failed to observe any modulation on synovial inflammation. Finally, balneotherapy in sulfurous water diminished the presence of oxidative damage markers. Our results suggest the beneficial effect of balneotherapy in sulfur-rich water on an experimental model of OA, showing a reduced cartilage destruction and oxidative damage. Thus, these findings support the use of balneotherapy as a non-pharmacological treatment in OA.",

      "abstract": "Musculoskeletal pain is a health challenge with various treatment strategies. The study has been accomplished with the aim to reveal the effect of mineral water with different mineral content on musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms experienced. A randomized controlled single-blinded parallel-group study has been performed (145 participants with pain; 5 groups). The duration of treatment was 2 weeks, whereas follow-up has taken 3 months. Change in pain after a single procedure and the pain parameters with related symptoms during the study period have been measured. The effect size using Cohen's d has been estimated. Small effect (0.2-0.4) on pain has been distinguished after each mineral water procedure. Tap water procedures have been effective in 60% of cases. Twenty grams per liter water baths have had a small effect on pain intensity and tender points, body flexibility, and spinal mobility, and a medium one on sleep quality, and reduced CRP. Forty grams per liter water has had a small effect on pain intensity, frequency, and spinal mobility, and a medium one on flexibility, fatigue, and sleep quality, and reduced ESR. Sixty grams per liter water has had a small effect on pain parameters and fatigue, and a medium one on flexibility and sleep quality, and reduced ESR. The effect lasting up to 2 months has been identified mostly in the 60 g/L group. Tap water has had a short time effect on pain intensity and tender points. There have not been any changes of sufficient significance identified in the control group and any differences between mineral water groups. Sufficient difference between mineral and tap water groups has been determined in pain intensity, spinal mobility, and sleep quality, whereas in the case of the control group, significant difference in pain intensity and frequency, flexibility, and spinal mobility has been identified. The consumption of pain medication has significantly decreased in all mineral water groups. The total mineral content of the water has no significant influence on the reduction of musculoskeletal pain. Mineral water baths have small effect on pain and medium effect on other musculoskeletal disease-related symptoms and pain medication consumption lasting up to 3 months; it is more beneficial than tap water or no treatment for the improvement of symptoms associated with musculoskeletal diseases. Even single balneotherapy procedure results in small pain reduction.",

Taking into consideration the observed increase in the spread of risk factors, modern demographic trends (an increase in the proportion of elderly people), and a high economic burden of circulatory system diseases, the search for new forms and effective strategies of prevention is becoming relevant. OBJECTIVE: To provide the data available in the scientific literature on the effectiveness of the measures to modify risk factors and lifestyle, which are implemented during balneotherapy under both resort and in non-resort conditions, and to define areas for further investigators in this field. Investigations evaluating the effectiveness of these measures were sought in the Embase, PubMed, PEDro, Web of Science, eLIBRARY databases in January 2012 to August 2018. The analysis included seven trials that showed an improvement of estimated endpoints (blood pressure, body mass index, lipid profile, physical activity, and morbidity and mortality rates). The generalization of results of the analyzed trials was limited by the high heterogeneity of their protocols and methodological quality, which does not allow for a final conclusion on the effectiveness of preventive measures implemented during balneotherapy. Future research should provide more evidence of the benefits of this approach. The analysis will be able to take into account the existing experience and to develop a strategy to enhance the effectiveness of cardiovascular disease prevention programs based on high-quality randomized clinical trials.",

The subjects received 10 mineral water bath plus physical therapy or mud application procedures plus physical therapy or physical therapy alone every other day. The effectiveness of the treatment was assessed on the basis of anthropometric changes of data, VAS, SF-36, KOOS questionnaire indicators. Significantly greater walking speed, test of 5 sit downs/stand ups, circumference of a knee joint, flexion and extension range, flexor and extensor strength after treatment lasting 1 month were obtained in the intervention group. After 1 month after treatment pain intensity scores over the past month and when changing position were significantly higher in the control group. The positive changes in SF-36 were identified after 1 month after treatment: physical activity increased and pain decreased in the intervention groups. There was no significant difference between the averages of any KOOS subscale in groups. However, average percentages of symptoms, stiffness, and pain in the intervention groups were significantly better after treatment and lasting 1 month after treatment.

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate whether balneotherapy might be effective in patients with chronic pelvic pain (CPP) in the short term. This was an open and prospective pilot study. The balneotherapy programme was performed in a spa resort located in Wando Island, Republic of Korea from August 26 2018 to September 1 2018. It consisted of 10 heated seawater baths (38 °C, 20 minutes) and 10 mud-pack applications (40 °C, 10 minutes) for five days. Sixteen patients were enrolled. Upon analysing responses from a patient questionnaire, we found improvement in parameters such as pain, bladder irrigation symptoms and quality of life after balneotherapy. Inflammatory marker IL-1 and TNF-α was significantly decreased after treatment compared to baseline. There were no adverse events during treatment. Our data suggest that five-day balneotherapy can be beneficial for patients with CPP in the short term.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? The majority of articles in the field of balneotherapy discuss the treatment of rheumatic or dermatological disease. However, data on the effectiveness of balneotherapy for chronic pelvic pain are very limited.What the results of this study add? Our study suggests that balneotherapy can be beneficial for patients with CPP in the short-term. The duration of balneotherapy was five days, which is shorter than that of the European studies. Intuitively, it may be doubtful whether short-term therapy has any practical effect. As most people living in Korea have a vacation period of about one week each in summer and winter, the choice of a five-day programme in our study reflects the reality of vacation schedules.What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Further studies are necessary to demonstrate the persistence of these benefits on the long term, as well as their existence in appropriate control group and different duration of treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a progressive and common disease that affects the superficial and deep venous systems of the lower limbs. CVI is characterised by valvular incompetence, reflux, venous obstruction, or a combination of these with consequent distal venous hypertension. Clinical manifestations of CVI include oedema, pain, skin changes, ulcerations and dilated skin veins in the lower limbs. It can result in a large financial burden on health systems. There is a wide variety of treatment options or therapies for CVI, ranging from surgery and medication to compression and physiotherapy. Balneotherapy (treatments involving water) is a relatively cheap option and potentially efficient way to deliver physical therapy for people with CVI. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of balneotherapy for the treatment of people with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED and CINAHL databases, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the Clinical Trials.gov trials register to August 2018. We searched the LILACS and IBECS databases. We also checked references, searched citations and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing balneotherapy with no treatment or other types of treatment for CVI. We also included studies that used a combination of treatments. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently reviewed studies retrieved by the search strategies. Both review authors independently assessed selected studies for complete analysis. We resolved conflicts through discussion. We attempted to contact trial authors for missing data, obtaining additional information. For binary outcomes (leg ulcer incidence and adverse events), we presented the results using odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes (disease severity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), pain, oedema, skin pigmentation), we presented the results as a mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. MAIN RESULTS: We included seven randomised controlled trials with 891 participants (outpatients in secondary care). We found no quasi-randomised controlled trials. Six studies (836 participants) evaluated balneotherapy versus no treatment. One study evaluated balneotherapy versus a phlebotonic drug (melilotus officinalis) (55 participants). There was a lack of blinding of participants and investigators, imprecision and inconsistency, which downgraded the certainty of the evidence.For the balneotherapy versus no treatment comparison, there probably was no improvement in favour of balneotherapy in disease severity signs and symptom score as assessed using the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) (MD -1.66, 95% CI -4.14 to 0.83; 2 studies, 484 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy probably resulted in a moderate improvement in HRQoL as assessed by the Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire 2 (CVIQ2) at three months (MD -9.38, 95% CI -18.18 to -0.57; 2 studies, 149 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), nine months (MD -10.46, 95% CI -11.81 to -9.11; 1 study; 55 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and 12 months (MD -4.99, 95% CI -9.19 to -0.78; 2 studies, 455 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in HRQoL between balneotherapy and no treatment at six months (MD -1.64, 95% CI -9.18 to 5.89; 2 studies, 445 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy probably slightly improved pain compared with no treatment (MD -1.23, 95% CI -1.33 to -1.13; 1 study; 390 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no clear effect related to oedema between the two groups at 24 days (MD 43.28 mL, 95% CI -102.74 to 189.30; 2 studies, 153 participants; very-low certainty evidence). There probably was no improvement in favour of balneotherapy in the incidence of leg ulcers (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.48; 2 studies, 449 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was probably a reduction in incidence of skin pigmentation changes in favour of balneotherapy at 12 months (pigmentation index: MD -3.59, 95% CI -4.02 to -3.16; 1 study; 59 participants; low-certainty evidence). The main complications reported included erysipelas (OR 2.58, 95% CI 0.65 to 10.22; 2 studies, 519 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), thromboembolic events (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.42; 3 studies, 584 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and palpitations (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.52; 1 study; 59 participants; low-certainty evidence), with no clear evidence of an increase in reported adverse effects with balneotherapy. There were no serious adverse events reported in any of the studies.For the balneotherapy versus a phlebotonic drug (melilotus officinalis) comparison, we observed no clear difference in pain symptoms (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.87; 1 study; 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and oedema (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.27; 1 study; 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence). This single study did not report on the other outcomes of interest. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified moderate- to low-certainty evidence that suggests that balneotherapy may result in a moderate improvement in pain, quality of life and skin pigmentation changes and has no clear effect on disease severity signs and symptoms score, adverse effects, leg ulcers and oedema when compared with no treatment. For future studies, measurements of outcomes such as disease severity sign and symptom score, quality of life, pain and oedema and choice of time points during follow-up must be standardised for adequate comparison between trials.",

A total of 305 individuals were randomized into two groups. Group I was applied PT alone; group II was applied PT + BT. Assessments were made using the Pain (VAS), EQ-5D-3L Scale, Western Ontario And McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) Scale, Epworth Sleepiness scale (EPWORTH) and the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology-The Osteoarthritis Research Society International set of responder criteria for osteoarthritis (OMERACT-OARSI) at the beginning (T0) and at the end (T1) of treatment. Statistically significant interactions found between treatment (PT alone or PT + BT) and time (before treatment and after treatment) in terms of Pain-VAS, Pain-WOMAC, Stiffness-WOMAC, Physical Function-WOMAC, Total-WOMAC, EQ-5D, EQ-VAS, FACIT-F, and EPWORTH scores (p < 0.0001 for all). According to OMERACT-OARSI criteria, the responder rate was 89.04% in PT alone group and 98.74% in PT + BT group. Balneotherapy plus physical therapy was more effective than physical therapy alone in KOA patients aged over 65 years. Reducing pain, especially, positively contributes to functionality, quality of life, fatigue and sleepiness of KOA patients.",

The present paper gives a perspective on the therapeutic use of mineral baths in the town of Solec-Zdroj in southeastern Poland, an old time spa endowed with rich natural sulfurous water resources. Historical aspects of the formation and development of the spa are presented, along with the contemporary insights into the plausible mechanisms and benefits of sulfide treatment, not only in otherwise hardly treatable chronic skin disorders but also in a variety of disease processes in organ systems. Sulfurous balneotherapy is not without potential risks, particularly for the skin, a tissue it is considered the most viable treatment for. The healing effect of sulfide waters does not increase in proportion to the sulfur content. As in every stimulus-based treatment, the stimulant strength should not go beyond the favorable hormetic boundaries of safety. Although the exact bioproperties of a high content of hydrogen sulfide in natural mineral springs are yet to be fully unraveled and understood in the context of healing capability, sulfide bath treatment is capable of growing and developing. It remains a cost-effective alternative to pharmaceutical products in a variety of disorders.",

Therefore, it is essential to evaluate effective therapeutic strategies. This study examines the effects of moderate mountain exercise and spa therapy on orthopedic and psychophysiological parameters. Based on a three-armed randomized controlled trial, guided mountain hiking tours and balneotherapy in thermal water were compared to a control group. METHODS: Eighty patients with diagnosed nscLBP were separated into three groups: The two intervention groups GE (green exercise) and GEBT (green exercise and balneotherapy) undertook daily mountain hiking tours, whereas the GEBT group got an additional treatment with baths in Mg-Ca-SO4 thermal water. The third group (CO) received no intervention. GE and GEBT group were treated for 6 days; all groups were followed up for 120 days. RESULTS: Compared to GE and CO group, the GEBT treatment showed significant improvements of pain, some orthopedic parameters, health-related quality of life and mental well-being in patients with nscLBP. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study confirmed a benefit of mountain hiking combined with Mg-Ca-SO4 spa therapy as a multimodal treatment of patients with nscLBP. Further studies should focus on long-term-effects of this therapeutic approach. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, ISRCTN99926592 . Registered 06. July 2018 - Retrospectively registered.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The natural factors of therapeutic significance play an important role in the rehabilitation of the patients suffering from chronic disorders of cerebral circulation since they are known to promote the development of the compensatory and adaptive processes. However, there is virtually no information in the relevant literature publications about the influence of balneotherapy on the dynamics of the cognitive sphere indicators and neurotrophic factors. AIMS: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of balneotherapy as a component of the combined treatment of the patients presenting with discirculatory encephalopathy based on the investigations into dynamics of the neuropsychological status and the quantitative content of the neurotrophic factors in the peripheral blood, with special reference to the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), in the patients receiving the balneotherapeutic treatment based at they at the 'Kluchi' health resort. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 72 patients presenting with the 1st and 2nd stages of chronic cerebral ischemia were examined (including 9 men and 63 women at the mean age of 62.2±2.1 years). They were given the health resort -based treatment during 14 days while staying at the 'Kluchi' resort located in the Perm region. The examination of all the patients included the psychometric testing and the determination of blood serum neurotrophic factors (BDNF and CNTF). The patients were allocated to three groups depending on the character of the prescribed treatment. The first group consisted of 29 subjects, who were given the conventional therapy (the alternation of hydrogen sulphide muds and baths number 7, daily massage of the neck-collar region in the combination with exercise therapy). The second group was comprised of 32 persons who received the standard course of chloride-sodium bromine baths number 7. The third group was composed of 11 persons suffering from chronic cerebral ischemia who received no balneo- or peloid therapy whatever. RESULTS: The study has revealed the different stages of cognitive and emotional disorders combined with the initially reduced level of BDNF in the blood serum of the examined patients. The level of BDNF in the peripheral blood of the patients comprising the first group increased from 3.68±2.15 to 5.02±2.88 ng/ml after the course of balneotherapy. These values were significantly higher than before the treatment (p=0.000). In the patients of the second group, the level of situational and personal anxiety estimated with the use of the Spielberger-Khanin test decreased in association with the improvement in the cognitive sphere after they received the standard course of balneotherapy including the usual chloride-sodium bromine baths. Simultaneously, the level of BDNF in the peripheral blood of these patents increased from 4.00±2.3 to 5.39±2.44 ng/ml (p=0.02). The patients of the third group, who were given no treatment whatever displayed no statistically significant changes of the studied parameters. CONCLUSION: The health resort-based treatment including the course of chloride-sodium bromine baths has a direct beneficial influence on the neuroreparative and neuroprotective functions in the patients presenting with chronic cerebral ischemia owing to the increase in the level of neurotrophic factors in the blood.",

Land-based exercise (LBE) and balneotherapy are two modalities currently prescribed, but the impact of the latter on balance control has not been studied. This study aimed to compare two programs of balneotherapy with or without LBE to improve postural control, looking at frequency and duration of treatment. A total of 236 KOA patients (mean age = 64 years) were included in this prospective and randomized study: 122 patients went through 3 weeks of standardized continuous balneotherapy (high frequency/short duration) program (Gr1) and 114 went through 3 weeks of discontinuous (low frequency) balneotherapy program followed by 3 weeks of LBE (Gr2). The total number of treatment sessions was the same for both groups. Posturography was carried out before balneotherapy (W0) and at 3 (W3), 6 (W6), and 12 (W12) weeks after the beginning of treatment. Postural control increased in Gr1 from W0 to W3 and from W0 to W12 and in Gr2 from W0 to W6 and from W3 to W6. The improvement was greater in Gr1 from W0 to W3 and from W6 to W12 and in Gr2 from W3 to W6. High-frequency intensive balneotherapy improved posture control at 3 weeks, while low-frequency balneotherapy did not. This improvement persisted over a 12-week assessment period at the same level. LBE generated an improvement that did not persist over time. Sustained improvement of postural control requires high-frequency repetition of consecutive balneotherapy sessions.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Population aging is one of the greatest socio-economic challenges of the 21st century, as aging is a well-known risk factor for the development of chronic diseases and functional disabilities. A sedentary life-style promotes the progression of chronic diseases and impaired mobility in older people. Therefore, physical activity is essential for healthy aging. The optimal exercise program for older persons, which covers fall prevention as well as endurance and strength, still remains unclear. METHODS: We performed a longitudinal, randomized, controlled intervention study to investigate the combined effects of moderate mountain hiking and balneotherapy on gait, balance, body composition and quality of life on high-functioning people aged 65-85 years. The intervention group (n = 106) participated in a seven-day holiday with mountain hiking tours. In addition, balneotherapy was applied. The control group (n = 33) spent a typical seven-day cultural holiday with sightseeing. Medical examinations were performed before (day 0) and after the intervention week (day 7), after two months (day 60) and after half a year (day 180). Statistical analysis was done by fully nonparametric analysis of variance-type testing. RESULTS: An improvement of static balance was observed in the intervention group (treatment effect p = 0.02). No significant changes were found in dynamic balance, measured as center of pressure, gait parameters and self-assessed balance confidence. Only for gait speed, a short-term effect was observed (treatment p = 0.03). The gait speed increased in the intervention group. Although quality of life improved significantly in both groups, a sustainable effect until day 60 is only visible in the intervention group (interaction effect for treatment and day-60 p = 0.02). Significant interaction effects of treatment and time were found for total body water (p = 0.04), appendicular muscle mass (p = 0.04) and fat free mass index (p = 0.03), all indicating an increase of these variables in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: A seven-day intervention with moderate mountain hiking in combination with balneotherapy is an effective training for highly functioning older persons, inducing short-term improvements in static balance and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The role of spa therapy is well defined and its importance has significantly increased in the healthcare but the utilization indicators of the implemented treatments are less known. AIM: The objective of our study was to analyze the utilization and the social insurance indicators of the healthcare publicly financed by health insurance in spa institutions. DATA AND METHODS: The data used for the analysis were derived from the funding database of the National Health Insurance Fund of Hungary. The period examined covered the years between 2009 and 2016. The spa treatment counts, social insurance expenses, the territorial inequalities in utilization, sex and age distribution of the treatments were examined. RESULTS: The treatment counts were the highest (7 349 587) in 2009 and they gradually decreased with 6 558  204 treatments by 2012. 'Spa pool of medicinal water' treatment was the most common care in each year which incidence showed a downward trend during the past years: 2 544  617 treatments were performed in 2009 but 2016 showed only 1 898  338 treatments. We found the highest health insurance expenditures in 2016: 4.261 billion HUF or 13.8 EUR. In the previous years, there was a lower health insurance expenditure: in 2010 3.928 billion HUF (14.3 million EUR), in 2011 3.921 billion HUF (14.0 million EUR) and in 2012 3.875 billion HUF (13.4 million EUR). The utilization made the highest incidence of treatments in Csongrád county with 13 174/10 000 inhabitants and 8160 thousand HUF/10 000 inhabitants of social security subsidy in 2016. The lowest utilization counts for treatments were found in Nógrád county with 3233/10 000 inhabitants and 2192 thousand HUF/10 000 inhabitants of social security subsidy. The highest utilization indicators were found in the age group between 60 and 69 in the distribution of population and genders. CONCLUSION: In the utilization of spa therapy funded by health insurance fund, no significant change has occurred during the past years but territorial discrepancies can be seen in sex, age, and county breakdown.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Balneotherapy with mud application (mud therapy) is a common hydrothermal intervention for the treatment and rehabilitation of elderly patients with osteoarthritis, leading to anti-inflammatory effects. The main purpose of this investigation was to study a role for regulatory T cells in these anti-inflammatory effects. The second objective was to assess whether the neutrophil-mediated innate response is affected by these anti-inflammatory effects. METHODS: Thirty-six elderly patients with knee osteoarthritis underwent a 10-day cycle of balneotherapy at a spa center. They received daily sessions of whole-body mud therapy at 40-42 °C, using mineral-medicinal water and mud. IL-8 and TGF-β serum concentrations, percentage of circulating CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+ and CD8+ CD28- regulatory T cells, and neutrophil phagocytic capacity were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Clinical assessments included knee flexion and extension angle, pain, stiffness, physical function and health-related quality of life. RESULTS: All clinical outcomes significantly improved. Circulating concentrations of IL-8 and TGF-β decreased, which correlated with decreased pain and improved knee flexion, respectively. Percentage of CD4+ regulatory T cells decreased, whereas CD8+ regulatory T cells increased. Neutrophil functional capacity increased. CONCLUSIONS: Balneotherapy with mud application was effective in the management of osteoarthritis symptoms. The anti-inflammatory effect mediated by cytokines contributed to the improvement in pain and joint function; and changes in the circulating percentage of regulatory T cells seem to be involved in the anti-inflammatory effects. Improvement in neutrophil function after mud therapy reflects an optimal bioregulatory effect on the inflammatory and innate responses.",

      "abstract": "Since ancient time, thermal baths and mudpacks have been used as treatments for rheumatic diseases and other musculoskeletal complaints. Despite basic researches suggest an anti-inflammatory effect of spa therapy, there is no consensus about the benefits of balneotherapy in patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases. The aim of this review is to summarize the currently available information on clinical effects of balneotherapy in these diseases. We did a literature search for articles considering the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published until today. Although many selected studies do not have an elevated methodological quality, data from these RCTs support a beneficial effect of spa therapy. Balneotherapy highly improves the clinical course of the disease in patients with predominant axial involvement, such as with ankylosing and enteropathic spondylitis; the effects are less favorable in patients with predominant peripheral articular inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Good results have been observed in patients with psoriatic arthritis, but only few RCTs have been conducted on this disease. Spa therapy appears safe, and adverse events have been reported only in a few patients.",

      "abstract": "Balneotherapy is a treatment with healing waters, which includes bathing and physiotherapy in thermal water, therapeutic drinks, medical massage, and water jet massage. It is based on the buoyancy, physical properties, temperature, and chemical effects of mineral water. Throughout European and Japanese medical institutions, balneology and hot spring therapy is very much a part of routine medical treatment. The mechanism of balneotherapy is not yet completely understood. Balneotherapeutic procedures are mainly performed for the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of musculoskeletal diseases, but they have also proven useful for various other indications such as for the treatment or rehabilitation of dermatological diseases, immuno-inflammatory diseases, chronic pain syndromes, chronic cardiac diseases, and metabolic syndromes or neurological diseases as well as in the rehabilitation of patients with psychiatric conditions. Balneotherapy works well in the case of muscle tension, as it is relieving and relaxing, and it may be associated with improvement of various diseases. However, further investigations are necessary to determine the effectiveness, safety, standard procedures, and potential side effects of balneotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Arthritic diseases are the most frequent causes of chronic pain and disability. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by synovial inflammation and progressive structural joint damage. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative process of the articular cartilage associated with hypertrophic changes in the bone. The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of Hévíz thermal water and mud in monosodium iodoacetate- (MIA-) (25 mg/ml, 20 μl i.a.) induced osteoarthritis and Complete Freund's adjuvant- (CFA-) (1 mg/ml, 50-50 μl s.c) induced rheumatoid arthritis murine models. The mechanonociceptive threshold of female NMRI mice (n=6- 8 mice/ group) was measured by aesthesiometry, and paw volume was monitored with plethysmometry, knee joint diameter with digital micrometer, and dynamic weight bearing on the hind limbs with a Bioseb instrument. Periarticular bone destruction was assessed by SkyScan 1176 in vivo micro-CT. Inflammatory cytokines were detected by ELISA in plasma samples. Treatments (30 min, every working day) with tap water, sand, and a combined therapy of tap water and sand served as controls. Hévíz medicinal water and combined treatment with water and mud significantly decreased the mechanical hyperalgesia and knee oedema in MIA-induced osteoarthritis model. However, balneotherapy did not influence mechanical hyperalgesia, weight bearing, or oedema formation induced by CFA. Neither medicinal water nor mud treatment ameliorated deep structural damage of the bones or the joints in the animal models. On the basis of the present findings, we conclude that balneotherapy is an effective complementary treatment to reduce the pain sensation and swelling in degenerative joint diseases such as osteoarthritis. Our experimental data are in agreement with the previous human studies that also confirmed antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of thermal water and Hévíz mud treatments."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal disease in the world. OA is the result of an inflammatory and degenerative process affecting the entire joint. Osteoarthritis, especially involving the knee, has a relevant socioeconomic impact in terms of drugs, hospital admissions, work absences, and temporary or permanent invalidity. Therapy of knee osteoarthritis is based on pharmacological and nonpharmacological measures. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the studies published between 2002 and 2017 on spa therapy, mud-pack therapy, balneotherapy, and mud-bath therapy in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis in order to investigate the evidence of the efficacy of such treatment on pain, functional limitation, drug use, and quality of life. Overall, 35 studies were examined among which 12 were selected and included in the review if they are trial comparative. We have been able to illustrate the main results obtained in the individual studies and to elaborate these results in order to allow as much a unitary presentation as possible and hence an overall judgment. RESULTS: Because the studies we reviewed differed markedly from one another in terms of the methods used, we were unable to conduct a quantitative analysis (meta-analysis) of pooled data from the 12 studies. For the purposes of the present review, we reevaluated the results of the different studies using the same statistical method, Student's t-test, which is used to compare the means of two frequency distributions. Among all the studies, the most relevant indexes used to measure effectiveness of spa therapy were improved including VAS, Lequesne, and WOMAC Score. CONCLUSIONS: The mud-pack therapy, balneotherapy, mud-bath therapy, and spa therapy have proved to be effective in the treatment and in the secondary prevention of knee osteoarthritis, by reducing pain, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug consumption, and functional limitation and improving quality of life of affected patients.",

This work aims to assess if balneotherapy and spa therapy can significantly improve Quality of Life (QoL) of patients with knee OA. Medline via PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and PEDro were systematically searched for articles about trials involving patients with knee OA and measuring the effects of balneotherapy and spa therapy on study participants' QoL with validated scales. A qualitative and quantitative syntheses were performed. Seventeen studies were considered eligible and included in the systematic review. Fourteen trials reported significant improvements in at least one QoL item after treatment. Ten studies were included in quantitative synthesis. When comparing balneological interventions with standard treatment, results favored the former in terms of long-term overall QoL [ES = - 1.03 (95% CI - 1.66 to - 0.40)]. When comparing balneological interventions with sham interventions, results favored the former in terms of long-term pain improvement [ES = - 0.38 (95% CI - 0.74 to - 0.02)], while no significant difference was found when considering social function [ES = - 0.16 (95% CI - 0.52 to 0.19)]. In conclusion, even though limitations must be considered, evidence shows that BT and spa therapy can significantly improve QoL of patients with knee OA. Moreover, reduction of drug consumption and improvement of algofunctional indexes may be other beneficial effects. Further investigation is needed because of limited available data.",

This therapy has been used for centuries and remains a popular form of treatment for dermatologic and rheumatologic diseases today. Although the favorable climates of balneotherapy thermal centers have known beneficial effects on psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, the thermal spring waters themselves can also potentially decrease skin inflammation. The addition of phototherapy to balneotherapy, or balneophototherapy, further enhances the anti-inflammatory effects of thermal spring water. We have reviewed the literature on balneotherapy in the treatment of skin diseases, as well as describing their use in three different treatment sites, each with unique climates and chemical properties of the mineral water used in balneotherapy-the Dead Sea in Israel and Jordan, the La Roche-Posay Thermal Center in France, and the Blue Lagoon in Iceland.",

The biological mechanisms by which immersion in mineral-medicinal water and the application of mud alleviate symptoms of several pathologies are still not completely understood, but it is known that neuroendocrine and immunological responses—including both humoral and cell-mediated immunity—to balneotherapy are involved in these mechanisms of effectiveness; leading to anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antioxidant, chondroprotective, and anabolic effects together with neuroendocrine-immune regulation in different conditions. Hormesis can play a critical role in all these biological effects and mechanisms of effectiveness. The hormetic effects of balneotherapy can be related to non-specific factors such as heat—which induces the heat shock response, and therefore the synthesis and release of heat shock proteins—and also to specific biochemical components such as hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) in sulfurous water and radon in radioactive water. Results from several investigations suggest that the beneficial effects of balneotherapy and hydrotherapy are consistent with the concept of hormesis, and thus support a role for hormesis in hydrothermal treatments.",

In a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial with a 6-month follow-up, 100 FS patients were randomized to receive a cycle of BT with highly mineralized sulfate water (BT group) or with tap water (control group). Clinical assessments were performed at screening visit, at basal time, and after treatment (2 weeks, 3 and 6 months). The primary outcome measures were the change of global pain on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire total score (FIQ-Total) from baseline to 15 days. Secondary outcomes included Widespread Pain Index, Symptom Severity Scale Score, Short Form Health Survey, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. We performed an intent-to-treat analysis. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied to verify the normality distribution of all quantitative variables and the Student's t test to compare sample data. In the BT group, we observed a significant improvement of VAS and FIQ-Total at the end of the treatment that persisted until 6 months, while no significant differences were found in the control group. The differences between groups were significant for primary parameters at each time point. Similar results were obtained for the other secondary outcomes except for the STAI outcome. Adverse events were reported by 10 patients in the BT group and by 22 patients in the control group. Our results support the short- and long-term therapeutic efficacy of BT in FS.

This systematic review primarily aims at assessing if balneotherapy, mud/peloid therapy, and spa therapy may influence cortisol levels. Secondarily, it aims at understanding if these interventions may improve stress resilience. PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant articles in English or Italian about studies involving healthy and sub-healthy subjects or patients with a diagnosed disease about effects of balneotherapy, mud/peloid therapy, and spa therapy on serum and salivary cortisol levels. Fifteen studies involving 684 subjects were included. Five studies investigated biological effects of balneotherapy alone. Two of them reported significant changes of cortisol levels in healthy participants. The other three studies reported no significant variations in patients with rheumatic conditions. No studies investigated biological effects of mud/peloid therapy alone. Ten studies investigated biological effects of spa therapy with or without included mud/peloid therapy, and in all but two studies, significant variations of cortisol levels were reported. Our main findings suggest that balneotherapy may have the potential to influence cortisol levels in healthy subjects, in such a way as to improve stress resilience. Spa therapy with or without included mud/peloid therapy demonstrated the same potential to influence cortisol levels also in sub-healthy subjects and in patients with a diagnosed disease. Therefore, balneotherapy and spa therapy may be considered as useful interventions for the management of stress conditions. Further investigation is needed because of limited available data.",

Several studies have shown a clear link between obesity and higher risk of knee OA. According to the multifactorial OA pathogenesis, the management of this condition requires a multidisciplinary approach. The objective of this study is to evaluate hydrokinesitherapy effects in thermal setting in obese patients with knee OA. Fifty-three patients were assessed for eligibility, of which 33 refused the treatment, while 10 patients dropped out after the enrollment for personal reasons or inability to adhere to the program. Ten patients (8 females, 2 males, mean age of 59.4 years) with obesity (range BMI 30-45 kg/m2) and knee OA (II-III grade of Kellgren-Lawrence scale) treated with hydrokinetic therapy in thermal water (two sessions per week for 8 consecutive weeks) completed the study. Primary outcome measure was pain (VAS). Secondary outcomes were clinical knee evaluation (range of motion-ROM, lower-limb muscle strength), WOMAC, and Lequesne Algofunctional Index. Patellar tendon and peri-articular soft tissue ultrasound evaluation and gait analysis at baseline (T0), at the end of treatment (T1), and at 6 months of follow-up (T2) were performed. Significant decrease on VAS pain during walking on a flat surface and going up/down stairs was reached from baseline at T1 (p = 0.0039; p = 0.0098) and was maintained at T2 (p = 0.00954) exclusively for VAS pain during walking on a flat surface. WOMAC score showed a significant reduction between T0 and T1 (p = 0.0137) and between T0 and T2 (p = 0.006438), as ROM evaluations. Kinematic path assessment did not show significant results in individual gait steps, except for the space-time variables of the average speed and the values of ground reaction force (GRF) obtained with force platforms. Hydrokinesitherapy in thermal environment in obese patients with knee OA may determine pain relief, joint function improvement, and walking speed increase until 6 months of follow-up.",

The intervention group underwent hot spring balneotherapy for 5 months, while the control group did not. The two groups took questionnaire investigation (general data, mental stress, emotional status, sleep quality, general health problems, as well as some women's health problems) and physical examination (height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, blood lipid, blood sugar) 5 months before and after the intervention, respectively. After intervention, sleep disorder (difficulty in falling asleep (P = 0.017); dreaminess, nightmare suffering, and restless sleep (P = 0.013); easy awakening (P = 0.003) and difficulty in falling into sleep again after awakening(P = 0.016); and mental stress (P = 0.031) and problems of general health (head pain (P = 0.026), joint pain(P = 0.009), leg or foot cramps (P = 0.001), blurred vision (P = 0.009)) were relieved significantly in the intervention group, as compared with the control group. While other indicators (fatigue, eye tiredness, limb numbness, constipation, skin allergy) and women's health problems (breast distending pain; dysmenorrhea, irregular menstruation) were relieved significantly in the self-comparison of the intervention group before and after intervention (P < 0.05), but showed no statistically significant difference between two groups (P > 0.05). All indications (except bad mood, low mood, and worry or irritability) in the intervention group significantly improved, with effect size from 0.096 to 1.302. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the frequency, length, and location of balneotherapy in the intervention group were the factors influencing emotion, sleep, and health condition (P < 0.05). Relief of insomnia, fatigue, and leg or foot cramps was greater in old-age group than in young-aged group (P < 0.05). Physical examination found that waist circumferences in women of various ages under 55 years were significantly reduced in the intervention group (P < 0.05), while that in men did not significantly change (P > 0.05). Spa therapy (balneotherapy) relieves mental stress, sleep disorder, general health, and reduces women's waist circumferences in sub-healthy people.",

Subjects in the balneotherapy group received whole-body immersion bath therapy in thermomineral water (30 min daily) for 21 days. Their blood samples were examined 1 day before and after balneotherapy. The parameters studied included mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), white blood cell (WBC), lactic acid (LAC), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), glucose (GLU), and triglycerides (TG) levels. [Results] After 21 days of balneotherapy, MCH levels and MCHC increased significantly and WBC counts increased significantly. LAC levels decreased significantly. ALT, GLU, and TG levels decreased signiﬁcantly. In the control group, there were no statistical differences before and after tap water baths following the same procedure.

Thirty-two patients with knee OA defined by the ACR criteria were included. Twenty-one patients (MBT group) were daily treated with a combination of local mud-packs at 42 °C and baths in mineral water, at 37 °C for 15 min, for 12 applications over a period of 2 weeks, in addition to standard therapy; 11 patients (control group) continued their conventional treatment alone. Global pain score evaluated by visual analog scale (VAS), WOMAC subscores, and microRNA expression were evaluated at baseline and after 2 weeks. Peripheral whole blood was collected into PAXgene™ Blood RNA tubes, stored at - 80 °C, and total RNA was extracted. The expression of miR-155, miR-223, miR-181a, miR-146a, and miR-let-7e was determined by qRT-PCR. After MBT, we observed a statistically significant improvement of clinical parameters and a significant decrease of miR-155, miR-181a, miR-146a (p < 0.001), and miR-223 (p < 0.01) expression levels. No clinical and biochemical modifications were detected in the control group. No significant variations of miR-let-7e were shown in both groups after 2 weeks. In conclusion, MBT can modify the expression of miR-155, miR-181a, miR-146a, and miR-223, which are upregulated in OA. It could be due to the heat stress and the hydrostatic pressure, since some miRNAs were found to be temperature- and mechano-responsive. Further studies are needed to better explain the mechanism of action of MBT and the role of miRNAs in OA.",

      "abstract": "Context • Balneotherapy is one of the most commonly used nonpharmacological interventions for osteoarthritis (OA), but its mechanism of action in relieving pain and stiffness and in improving physical function is not well understood. Studies have found that therapy provokes a series of neuroendocrinal reactions with anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid, has been implicated as an important mediator in the maintenance of physiological processes (eg, vascular barrier integrity) and in pathophysiologic processes such as inflammatory conditions. Accordingly, targeting S1P and S1P receptors may offer a potential therapy for arthritis. Objective • The aims of the present study were to determine whether (1) balneotherapy modified the circulating levels of S1P as well as some inflammatory parameters and stress markers, in patients with OA; and (2) to assess the relationship of those parameters to therapeutic efficacy. Design • This study was designed as an uncontrolled longitudinal study. Setting • The study took place at the Bolu Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Hospital (Bolu, Turkey). Participants • Forty patients who suffered from general OA in at least 3 positions on the body, one of which could be the vertebral column, and who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology Classification criteria and the Kellgren-Moore radiologic criteria, were enrolled in the intervention group in the study. Intervention • During balneotherapy, the participants were fully immersed in warm thermo-mineral water for 20 min at a temperature of 38°C to 40°C. A total of 15 immersions were performed in a period of 15 d. Outcome Measures • A baseline clinical evaluation of participants' pain, stiffness, and physical function was carried out using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities questionnaire. Baseline serum levels of S1P, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3), and heat shock protein 70 (HSP-70) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, with an immunoturbidimetric assay. The clinical evaluations and the biochemical measurements were repeated after completion of the balneotherapy period. Results • Balneotherapy caused a significant reduction in circulating levels of S1P and high-density lipoprotein and a limited increase in HSP-70 levels, in addition to a reduction in pain and stiffness and an improvement in physical function. In the Spearman's correlation analysis, S1P was found to be positively associated with serum levels of HSP-70, COX-2, and MMP-3. Conclusion • Balneotherapy modulated serum S1P levels in patients with OA. The effect of S1P modulation on the clinical outcome of patients with OA should be further investigated.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effects of balneotherapy on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are still controversial partly due to poor methodology used in randomized controlled trials, as reported in the international medical literature. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether spa therapy plus pharmacological treatment offers any benefit in the management of RA as compared to pharmacological treatment alone. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, controlled, unblinded randomly assigned study of patients with RA according to American College of Rheumatology criteria. Following the 2007 recommendations of AFRETH, the method designed for this study was \"immediate treatment versus delayed treatment.\" All patients were followed at the Centro Hospitalar do Porto and each physician observed the same patients throughout the study. Patients continued with their usual medications and maintained their daily life activities at home, at leisure and/or in the workplace. The spa therapy group received spa treatments for 21 days at S. Jorge Spa-Santa Maria da Feira. The main outcome measure was the HAQ-DI; the moderated regression analysis, together with the Johnson-Neyman technique, was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: HAQ-DI at the end of treatment (21 days) and at the 3 month follow-up was improved in the spa group (odds ratio 0.37, confidence interval 0.09-0.64, P = 0.01 at 21 days, and 0.44, 0.15-0.72, P = 0.004 at 3 months). CONCLUSIONS: In individuals in whom pain (physical and psychological) predominates, any complementary gain in function is beneficial. The main goal is to enhance quality of life.",

We searched electronic databases for eligible studies published from 2004 to December 31, 2016, with language restrictions of English or Japanese. We screened publications in Medline, Embase, Cochrane library, and the Japan Medical Abstracts Society Database using two approaches, MeSH terms and free words. Studies that examined the effect of balneotherapy for treating knee osteoarthritis of a ≥2-week duration were included. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores were used as the outcome measure. A total of 102 publications were assessed according to the exclusion criteria of the study; eight clinical trial studies, which comprised a total of 359 cases and 375 controls, were included in this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis analyzed improvement in WOMAC score at the final follow-up visit, which varied from 2 to 12 months post-intervention. Our meta-analysis indicates that balneotherapy was clinically effective in relieving pain and stiffness, and improving function, as assessed by WOMAC score, compared to controls. However, there was high heterogeneity (88 to 93%). It is possible that balneotherapy may reduce pain and stiffness, and improve function, in individuals with knee osteoarthritis, although the quality of current publications contributes to the heterogeneity observed in this meta-analysis.",

Patients followed by constipation scores, short-form health survey (SF-12), and a colonic transit time (CTT) study before and after balneotherapy were included in this study, and the data of the patients were analyzed retrospectively. The constipation score, SF-12 score, and CTT were found statistically significant after balneotherapy (p < 0.05). The results of our study confirm the clinical finding that a 15-day course of balneotherapy with mineral water from a thermal spring (Bursa, Turkey) improves gastrointestinal motility and reduces laxative consumption in the management of constipation in middle-aged and elderly patients, and it is our belief that treatment with thermal mineral water could considerably improve the quality of life of these patients.",

Indeed, few strategies are effective in helping patients to discontinue long-term benzodiazepine treatments. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and the impact of a program including cognitive behavioural therapy, psychoeducation, and balneotherapy in a spa resort to facilitate long-term discontinuation of benzodiazepines. We conducted a prospective multicentre cohort study. Patients with long-term benzodiazepine use were recruited with the aim of anxiolytic withdrawal by means of a psychoeducational program and daily balneotherapy during 3 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome measure was benzodiazepine use 6 months after the program, compared to use at baseline. A total of 70 subjects were enrolled. At 6 months, overall benzodiazepine intake had decreased by 75.3%, with 41.4% of patients completely stopping benzodiazepine use. The results also suggest a significantly greater improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms among patients who discontinued benzodiazepines compared to patients who only reduced their use. Our findings suggest that balneotherapy in association with a psychoeducative program is efficient in subjects with benzodiazepine addiction."

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress has been shown to play a contributory role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recent studies have provided evidence for antioxidant properties of spa therapy. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether spa therapy with saline balneotherapy has any influence on the oxidant/antioxidant status in patients with RA and to assess clinical effects of spa therapy. In this investigator-blind randomized controlled trial, we randomly assigned 50 patients in a 1:1 ratio to spa therapy plus standard drug treatment (spa group) or standard drug treatment alone (control group). Spa group followed a 2-week course of spa therapy regimen consisting of a total of 12 balneotherapy sessions in a thermal mineral water pool at 36-37 °C for 20 min every day except Sunday. All clinical and biochemical parameters were assessed at baseline and after spa therapy (2 weeks). The clinical parameters were pain intensity, patient global assessment, physician global assessment, Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ-DI), Disease Activity Score for 28-joints based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-4[ESR]). Oxidative status parameters were malondialdehyde (MDA), nonenzymatic superoxide radical scavenger activity (NSSA), antioxidant potential (AOP), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The NSSA levels were increased significantly in the spa group (p = 0.003) but not in the control group (p = 0.509); and there was a trend in favor of spa therapy for improvements in NSSA levels compared to control (p = 0.091). Significant clinical improvement was found in the spa group compared to the control in terms of patient global assessment (p = 0.011), physician global assessment (p = 0.043), function (HAQ-DI) (p = 0.037), disease activity (DAS28-4[ESR]) (0.044) and swollen joint count (0.009), and a trend toward improvement in pain scores (0.057). Spa therapy with saline balneotherapy exerts antioxidant effect in patients with RA as reflected by the increase in NSSA levels after spa therapy; whether this antioxidant effect contributes to the clinical improvements observed remains to be verified.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of balneotherapy on treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome, compared with education alone. METHODS: A total of 66 patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia syndrome were randomly separated into balneotherapy and control groups. Patients in both groups were informed about fibromyalgia syndrome. In addition, the balneotherapy group received 21 sessions of spa treatment with 34.8 °C thermomineral water, attending the spa 5 days a week. Patients were evaluated by visual analogue scale, tender point count, fibromyalgia impact questioning, and modified fatigue impact scale at initiation of treatment on the 15th day, 1st month, 3rd month, and 6th month. Evaluations were performed by the same doctor. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvement was detected in all parameters, compared to starting evaluation, in both groups. Most improved results among all parameters were observed in the balneotherapy group on the first 3-month follow-up. In addition, all parameters beyond tender point count and modified fatigue impact were improved on 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that addition of balneotherapy to patient education has both short- and long-term beneficial effects on female patients with fibromyalgia.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigated serum cortisol and serum dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEA-S) levels between fibromyalgia (FMS) patients and a control group, and the effect of balneotherapy (BT) on these hormones.   METHODS: Seventy-two patients with FMS and 39 healthy volunteers were included in the study. This prospective and cross-sectional study was carried out in the Medical Faculty, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinic, Cumhuriyet University, Cumhuriyet, Turkey between June 2012 and June 2013. Patients were divided into 2 groups. There were 40 patients in the first group, consisting of BT and physical therapy (PT) administered patients. There were 32 FMS patients in the second group who were only administered PT. Thirty-nine healthy volunteers were enrolled as a control group.   RESULT: Cortisol was observed to be lower in FMS patients compared with the controls  (10.10±4.08 µg/dL and 11.78±3.6 µg/dL; p=0.033). Serum DHEA-S level was observed to be lower in FMS patients compared with the controls (89.93±53.96 µg/dL and 143.15±107.92 µg/dL; p=0.015). Average serum cortisol levels of patients receiving BT were determined to be 9.95±3.20 µg/dL before treatment and 9.06±3.77µg/dL after treatment; while average serum DHEA-S levels were 77.60±48.05 µg/dL before treatment, and 76.84±48.71 µg/dL after treatment. No significant changes were determined in serum cortisol and DHEA-S levels when measured again after BT and PT.   CONCLUSION: Low levels of serum cortisol and DHEA-S were suggested to be associated with the physiopathology of FMS.",

Method. 180 seamen were randomized into three groups: geothermal (65), music (50), and control (65). The geothermal group was administered 108 g/L salinity geothermal water bath for 2 weeks five times a week. Primary outcome was effect on stress and fatigue. Secondary outcomes were the effect on cognitive function, mood, and pain. Results. The improvements after balneotherapy were a reduction in the number and intensity of stress-related symptoms, a reduction in pain and general, physical, and mental fatigue, and an improvement in stress-related symptoms management, mood, activation, motivation, and cognitive functions with effect size from 0.8 to 2.3. In the music therapy group, there were significant positive changes in the number of stress symptoms, intensity, mood, pain, and activity with the effect size of 0.4 to 1.1. The researchers did not observe any significant positive changes in the control group. The comparison between the groups showed that balneotherapy was superior to music therapy and no treatment group. Conclusions. Balneotherapy is beneficial for stress and fatigue reduction in comparison with music or no therapy group. Geothermal water baths have a potential as an efficient approach to diminish stress caused by working or living conditions."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 120 female subjects (mean age 37.21±12.45 years; range 18 to 63 years) diagnosed with fibromyalgia were enrolled. The patients were randomized into three groups with 40 patients in each (group 1: balneotherapy group, group 2: balneotherapy + exercise group, and group 3: exercise group). The patients underwent the treatment program for five days a week for a total of three weeks. Clinical parameters, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, TMS, and Beck Depression Scale were evaluated at pre-treatment and post- treatment periods, and at the third-month control visit. RESULTS: There were no differences between the groups with respect to Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, TMS and Beck Depression Scale scores on pre-treatment evaluation, while the combined use of balneotherapy + aerobic exercise was more effective on TMS (p<0.001), health status (p=0.009), and level of depression (p<0.001) in post-treatment evaluation. A better state of well-being with respect to sleep quality was achieved by balneotherapy and balneotherapy + exercise groups. The third-month comparisons, on the other hand, demonstrated that the balneotherapy + exercise group had a greater state of well-being with respect to TMS (p<0.001) and general health status (p<0.001). Balneotherapy + exercise and exercise therapy benefited signs of depression to a better degree (p<0.001). Balneotherapy and combined balneotherapy + exercise therapy produced more effective results in terms of sleep quality (p<0.001). TMS regressed to near baseline levels (p=0.397), while Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire levels rose to near baseline levels at the third-month control in the exercise therapy group (p=0.070). CONCLUSION: The combined application of balneotherapy + exercise therapy, which are two of the recommended non-pharmacological treatments, may have superior and more sustained effects than administering either therapy alone."

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of balneotherapy (BT), which is applied in addition to physical therapy (PT), in the treatment of chronic neck pain. Sixty patients with chronic neck pain were divided into study (n = 30) and control (n = 30) groups. All of the patients in both groups were treated with a 15-session standard PT program consisting of hot pack, ultrasound, and transcutaneous electrical stimulation. Patients in the study group were also treated with a 15-session BT program lasting 20 min/day in addition to the standard PT program. Visual analogue scale (VAS), modified neck disability index (mNDI), and Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) scores of all patients were evaluated at three different times as pretreatment, posttreatment, and posttreatment third week. There was no statistically significant difference between the clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients in different groups before treatment. Intragroup analysis revealed significant improvement in all parameters for both of the groups at all time intervals. Intergroup analysis uncovered the superiority of the study group. According to the results of this study, BT in combination with PT is superior to PT alone in reducing pain and disability and improving quality of life in patients with chronic neck pain.",
