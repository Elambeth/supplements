      "abstract": "Articular cartilage defects often involve damage to both the cartilage and subchondral bone, requiring a scaffold that can meet the unique needs of each tissue type and establish an effective barrier between the bone and cartilage. In this study, we used 3D printing technology to fabricate a tri-phasic scaffold composed of PLA/PCL-PLGA/Mg(OH)₂, which includes a cartilage layer, an osteochondral interface, and a bone layer. The scaffold was filled with Velvet antler polypeptides (VAP), and its characterization was assessed using compression testing, XRD, FTIR, SEM, fluorescence microscopy, and EDS. In vitro investigation demonstrated that the scaffold not only supported osteogenesis but also promoted chondrogenic differentiation of fibrocartilage stem cells (FCSCs). n vivo experiments showed that the tri-phasic PLA/PCL-PLGA/Mg(OH)2-VAP scaffold together with FCSC, when transplanted to animal models, increased the recovery of osteochondral defects. Those results demonstrate the promising future of illustrated tri-phasic PLA/PCL-PLGA/Mg(OH)2-VAP scaffold loaded with FCSCs as a new bone and cartilage tissue engineering approach for osteochondral defects treatment."

      "abstract": "AIM: We isolated a novel polypeptide PNP1 from velvet antler and investigated the role of PNP1 in ischemia reperfusion and its associated mechanism. METHODS: We built the ischemia reperfusion mouse model by the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) approach. Thereafter, PNP-1 was injected via the tail vein, and neurological function was scored. Meanwhile, the tissue injury level was detected through hematoxylin & eosin (HE) and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, inflammatory factor levels were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while protein levels through Western blotting. In addition, vascular endothelial cells were used to construct the oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) injury model in vitro, so as to detect the intervention effect of PNP1 on endothelial injury. Additionally, microglial cells were utilized to construct the inflammatory injury model to examine the impact of PNP1 on the polarization of microglial cells. RESULTS: PNP1 suppressed hypoxic cerebral injury in MCAO mice, decreased the tissue inflammatory factors, promoted tissue angiogenesis, and reduced the ischemic penumbra area. Experimental results in vitro demonstrated that, PNP1 suppressed vascular endothelial cell injury, and inhibited microglial M1 polarization as well as inflammatory response. CONCLUSION: Velvet antler polypeptide PNP1 isolated in this study has the anti-ischemic cerebral injury effect, and its mechanism is associated with suppressing vascular endothelial cell injury and microglial cell inflammatory response.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a systemic osteopathy characterized by bone metabolism disorders that become more serious with age increases in postmenopausal women. Recent studies have found that antler protein is the main bioactive component of cervus pantotrichum, and it has a positive regulatory effect on bone metabolism and can improve estrogen level. This study aimed to investigate the effect of velvet antler extract (VAE) on the prevention of osteoporosis and the modulation of gut microbiota in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. OVX mice treated with 12 weeks of VAE exhibited higher levels of serum BGP, Ca2+, CT, and HyP (p < .05). Micro-CT scans showed that VAE significantly elevated bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular bone number (Tb.N), trabecular bone thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular bone connection density (Conn.D), decreased trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), and structural modality index (SMI) than untreated OVX mice. The right tibial retinaculum in the VAE group was clearer, with a clearer reticular structure, smaller gaps, a tighter distribution, and a more orderly arrangement. The gut microbiota of the cecal contents was analyzed by 16 s rDNA amplicon sequencing. The data indicated that VAE modulated the species, numbers, and diversity of the gut microbiota in OVX mice. Ovariectomy caused dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota by increasing the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes in mice, but the ratio decreased after treatment with VAE. These results suggest that VAE has a therapeutic effect on OVX mice via modulate bone-related biochemical markers in serum and structure of gut microbiota."

      "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as a central toxic factor of gram-negative bacteria, can induce oxidative stress and cellular inflammation to result in the impairment of female fertility in different organisms. Particularly, it has harmful effects on the oocyte quality and subsequent embryonic development. However, the approach concerning how to prevent oocytes from LPS-induced deterioration still remains largely unexplored. We assessed the effective influences of velvet antler water extract (VAWE) by immunostaining and fluorescence intensity quantification on the meiotic maturation, mitochondrial function and sperm binding ability of oocytes under oxidative stress. Here, we report that VAWE treatment restores the quality of porcine oocytes exposed to LPS. Specifically, LPS exposure contributed to the failed oocyte maturation, reduced sperm binding ability and fertilization capability by disturbing the dynamics and arrangement of meiotic apparatuses and organelles, including spindle assembly, chromosome alignment, actin polymerization, mitochondrial dynamics and cortical granule distribution, the indicators of oocyte nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation. Notably, VAWE treatment recovered these meiotic defects by removing the LPS-induced excessive ROS and thus inhibiting the apoptosis. Collectively, our study illustrates that VAWE treatment is a feasible strategy to improve the oocyte quality deteriorated by the LPS-induced oxidative stress.",

PURPOSE: In this study, chitosan/sodium alginate/velvet antler blood peptides (CS/SA/VBPs) hydrogel (CAVBPH) was fabricated and used in the treatment of skin wounds in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) for the first time. METHODS: VBPs were prepared by hydrolysis and ultrafiltration, and their sequences were identified using LC-MS/MS. The CAVBPH was further fabricated and characterized. A mouse model of T2D was induced by a high-sugar and high-fat diet (HSFD) and streptozotocin (STZ) injection. CAVBPH was applied topically to T2D wounds, and its effects on skin repair and potential biological mechanisms were analyzed by appearance observation, histopathological staining, bioinformatics analysis, Western blot, and 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: VBPs had numerous short-chain active peptides, excellent antioxidant activity, and a low hemolysis rate. CAVBPH exhibited desirable biochemical properties and participated in the diabetic wound healing process by promoting cell proliferation (PCNA and α-SMA) and angiogenesis (capillaries and CD31) and alleviating inflammation (CD68). Mechanistically, the therapeutic effect of CAVBPH on chronic wounds might rely on activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α/VEGFA pathway and reversing the expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β. The results of 16S rRNA sequencing indicated that T2D significantly altered the diversity and structure of skin flora at the wound site. CAVBPH treatment elevated the relative abundance of beneficial microbes (e.g., Corynebacterium_1 and Lactobacillus) and reversed the structural imbalance of skin microbiota. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that CAVBPH is a promising wound dressing, and its repair effect on diabetic wounds by regulating angiogenesis, inflammatory response, and skin flora may depend on the rich small peptides in VBPs."

      "abstract": "Skin wound healing is a principal clinical challenge, and it is necessary to develop effective alternative treatments. Excessive inflammatory response is linked to delayed healing. This study was the first to report a multi-functional chitosan/sodium alginate/velvet antler blood peptides (VBPs) hydrogel (CAVBPH) and explore its potential mechanism to promote wound healing. The results showed that CAVBPH possessed desirable characteristics including thermo-sensitivity, antioxidation, antibacterial activity, biosafety, VBPs release behavior, etc., and significantly accelerated skin wound healing in mice. Specifically, the CAVBPH treatment enhanced cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix (ECM) secretion, and also relieved inflammation at the wound site compared to the PBS-treated group and blank hydrogel scaffold-treated group. Mechanistically, the efficacy of CAVBPH might be related to the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and SIRT1/NF-κB pathways. Overall, CAVBPH seems to be a promising therapy for skin repair, probably relying on the abundant short-chain peptides in VBPs."

      "abstract": "AIM: Scar formation generally occurs in cutaneous wound healing in mammals, mainly caused by myofibroblast aggregations, and currently with few effective treatment options. However, the pedicle wound (about 10 cm in diameter) of the deer can initiate regenerative healing, which has been found to be achieved via paracrine factors from the internal tissues of antlers. METHODS: Enzymatically digested velvet antler peptides (EVAP) were prepared along with other types of antler extracts as the controls. The effects of EVAP on healing of full-thickness skin wounds were evaluated using rats in vivo, and on myofibroblast transdifferentiation tested using transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-induced human dermal fibroblasts in vitro. RESULTS: EVAP significantly accelerated the wound healing rate, reduced scar formation, and improved the healing quality, including promoted angiogenesis, increased number of skin appendages (hair follicles and sebaceous glands) and improved the distribution pattern of collagen fibers (basket-wave like) in the healed tissue. Moreover, EVAP significantly down-regulated the expression levels of genes pro- scar formation (Col1a2 and TGF-β1), and up-regulated the expression levels of genes anti-scar formation (Col3a1 and TGF-β3), and suppressed the excessive transdifferentiation of myofibroblasts and the formation of collagen I in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we found these effects were highly likely achieved by inhibiting the TGF-β signaling pathway, evidenced by decreased expression levels of the related genes, including TGF-β1, Smad2, p-Smad2, α-SMA, and collagen I. CONCLUSIONS: EVAP may be a promising candidate to be developed as a clinic drug for regenerative wound healing."

      "abstract": "Deer velvet antlers are the young horns of male deer that are not ossified and densely overgrown. Velvet antler and its preparations have been widely used in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) in recent years, although its mechanism of action in the human body remains unclear. To screen the effective ingredients and targets of velvet antler in the treatment of PMOP using network pharmacology and to explore the potential mechanisms of velvet antler action in such treatments, we screened the active ingredients and targets of velvet antler in the BATMAN-TCM database. We also screened the relevant targets of PMOP in the GeneCards and OMIM databases and then compared the targets at the intersection of both velvet antler and PMOP. We used Cytoscape 3.7.2 software to construct a network diagram of \"disease-drug-components-targets\" and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network through the STRING database and screened out the core targets; the R language was then used to analyze the shared targets between antler and PMOP for GO-enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway-annotation analysis. Furthermore, we used the professional software Maestro 11.1 to verify the predictive analysis based on network pharmacology. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and micro-CT were used to observe the changes in trabecular bone tissue, further confirming the results of network pharmacological analysis. The potentially effective components of velvet antler principally include 17β-E2, adenosine triphosphate, and oestrone. These components act on key target genes such as AKT1, IL6, MAPK3, TP53, EGFR, SRC, and TNF and regulate the PI3K/Akt-signaling and MAPK-signaling pathways. These molecules participate in a series of processes such as cellular differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism, and inflammation and can ultimately be used to treat PMOP; they reflect the overall regulation, network regulation, and protein interactions."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the controversial Chinese herbal prescriptions containing Ejiao or Velvet antler (VA) in the treatment of uterine fibroids. METHODS: We searched 4 famous Chinese databases, the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, PubMed, Cochrane Central, Google Scholar, Embase, and J-STAGE up to July 2019. We included all eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared Chinese herbal prescriptions containing Ejiao or VA (E/VA) with placebo, pharmaceutical intervention, surgery, or other traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) for uterine fibroids and assessed the risk of bias according to the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. The software Review Manager (RevMan) 5.1 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 9 RCTs involving 844 patients were identified. Meta-analyses demonstrated that TCM (E/VA) plus mifepristone reduced the volume of uterine fibroids to a greater degree than mifepristone alone [standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.59, 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.85, P<0.00001, I2=50%]; TCM (E/VA) did not enlarge the volume of fibroids when menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) significantly increased the volume (SMD: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.38, P<0.00001, I2=0. The uterine volume change difference was larger via combination therapy of TCM (E/VA) and mifepristone than that of mifepristone (SMD: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.49, P=0.005, I2=0%). The TCM (E/VA) group of had an advantage over the control group in the improvement of fibroid-related symptoms [relative risk (RR): 1.24, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.35, P<0.00001, I2=0%]. It was found that TCM (E/VA) plus mifepristone could lower estradiol (E2) levels to a greater degree than mifepristone alone (SMD: 1.63, 95% CI: 0.42 to 2.83, P=0.008, I2=97%), as well as progesterone (P) level (SMD: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.55 to 1.04, P<0.00001, I2=43%) in non-menopausal women. A total of 5 studies reported adverse events (AEs), the TCM (E/VA) group was potentially safer than the control group, with lower incidence of AEs (RR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.40, P<0.00001, I2=25.8%). DISCUSSION: TCM prescriptions containing E/VA seemed superior to the control group in shrinking the volume of uterine fibroids and uterus, improving related symptoms, and reducing non-menopausal women's E2 and P levels, with lower incidence of AEs.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of VA on heart failure (HF) caused by ischemia-reperfusion, and explore its possible mechanism from the regulation of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2 alpha (SERCA2a). Methods: A rat model of HF was established by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery of male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 88). One week after surgery, VA (200, 400, or 800 mg/[kg day-1]) or enalapril (1 mg/[kg day-1]) was administered daily for the next 4 weeks. Heart function was detected by echocardiography and histopathological analysis. The serum BNP level was measured by ELISA, and the expression of SERCA2a, PLB, PLB-Ser16, and PKA was determined by western blotting. SERCA2a and PLB mRNA levels were determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Results: Compared with the sham group, cardiac function in the HF group, including the serum BNP level, heart mass index, myocardial collagen deposition, and left ventricular ejection fraction, was markedly reduced; however, these changes could be reversed by VA treatment. In addition, VA (200 mg/[kg·d-1]) inhibited the decrease of SERCA2a and PLB mRNA levels and SERCA2a, PLB, PLB-Ser16, and PKA protein expression and restored the activity of SERCA2a and PKA. Enalapril affected only PLB protein expression. Conclusion: VA can improve myocardial fibrosis and ventricular remodeling in rats, thereby helping to restore cardiac function. The underlying mechanism may be related to the upregulation of the expression and activation of PKA and PLB and the restoration of the expression and activity of SERCA2a."

      "abstract": "Background: The mucus integrity and abnormal inflammatory response are the crucial biomarker of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Velvet antler (VA) has been used as traditional Chinese medicines for many years. Anti-inflammatory property was demonstrated via suppression of cyclooxygenase-2 and cytokines protein expression. And it has further proved to promote wound healing in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats model. The aforementioned functionalities of VA extracts may be associated with the treatment of IBD. Thus, the aim of present study was to evaluate the effect of velvet antler water extracts form Formosan Sambar deer (Rusa unicolor swinhoei, SVAE) and red deer (Cervus elaphus, RVAE) on the barrier function and to investigate the possible mechanism using in vitro model. Methods: Human colonic epithelial cell models (Caco-2) were co-cultured with various concentrations of both SVAE and RVAE (250-500 µg mL-1) in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model. Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) value and the macromolecule permeability of Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran were measured to evaluate the integrity of monolayer of Caco-2. Western blotting was performed for analysis of protein expressions of occludin, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), claudin-1, claudin-2 and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). The cytotoxicity was conducted by MTT assay. Results: Results indicated that both SVAE and RVAE could enhance integrity of monolayer in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colonic epithelial cell model (Caco-2) through reducing the decline of trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and macromolecule permeability at the concentration of 250 μg mL-1. RVAE significantly increased the expression of tight junction proteins (occludin and ZO-1) while SVAE significantly reduced the activity of MLCK (P < 0.05.). Elevated C-C chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) production suggested that both SVAE and RVAE could enhance the repair of epithelial cell. Besides, MTT assay revealed that both extracts showed no cytotoxicity. Conclusion: Thus, SVAE and RVAE supplementation may attenuate barrier damage by enhancing the occludin and ZO-1 protein expression, decreasing MLCK expression, promoting the CCL20 production. In the future, animal study is needed for further confirmation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is closely related to osteoarthritis. In our preliminary study, β-catenin conditional activation (cAct) mice that specifically over-express β-catenin gene in cartilage chondrocyte exhibits osteoarthritis-like phenotype in the lumbar disc and knee joint. Therefore, we used the mice to model FJ-OA and test the potential curative effect of Velvet Antler Polypeptide (VAP) on this mice model. METHODS: We tested the effect of VAP on β-catenin conditional activation mice, and used Cre negative littermates as controls. Micro-CT, histology and histomorphometry analysis were performed to evaluate the curative effect of VAP on mice facet joint-like phenotype. Expression of β-catenin and collagen II was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western-blot., MMP13, ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 was detected by immunofluorescence (IF). RT-PCR analysis was preformed to detect mRNA expression of cartilage degrading enzymes, such as MMP13, ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5. RESULTS: Results of micro-CT (μCT) analysis showed that VAP could partially reverse lumbar disc osteophyte formation observed in β-catenin(ex3)Col2ER mice. Histology data revealed VAP partially improved facet joint cartilage tissue invades. Histomorphometry analysis showed an increase in total cartilage area after VAP treatment. IHC show that VAP reduced β-catenin protein levels and moderately up-regulated collagen II protein levels. RT-PCR and IF data showed that VAP down-regulated the expression of extracellular matrix synthesis (ECM) degradation enzymes MMP13, ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5. CONCLUSION: Taken together, VAP may modulate ECM by inhibits MMP13, ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 via Wnt /β-catenin signaling pathway. Velvet Antler Polypeptide may be a potential medicine for FJ-OA.",

      "abstract": "Velvet antler (Cervus elaphus) is a typical traditional animal medicine. It is considered to have various pharmacological effects including stimulation of the immune system, increase in the physical strength, and enhancement of sexual function. This paper aims to investigate the aqueous extract of velvet antler (AVA) in the mouse models of LPS-induced ALI. Inhibition of NO, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 productions contributes to the attenuation of LPS-induced lung inflammation by AVA. A 5-day pretreatment of AVA prevented histological alterations and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity in lung tissues. AVA significantly reduced the material (total number of cells and proteins) in the BALF. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of iNOS and COX-2 and phosphorylation of IκB-α and MAPKs proteins are blocked in LPS-stimulated macrophages as well as LPS-induced lung injury in mice. Consistent with this concept, the phosphorylation of CaMKKβ, LKB1, AMPK, Nrf2, and HO-1 was activated after AVA treatment. The results from this study indicate AVA has anti-inflammatory effects in vivo and AVA is a potential model for the development of health food. In addition, its pathways may be at least partially associated with inhibiting MAPK/NF-κB activation and upregulating AMPK/Nrf2 pathways and the regulation of antioxidant enzyme activity."

      "abstract": "Velvet antler (VA) is a precious traditional Chinese medicine that is capable of repeated regeneration. Based on the Chinese medicine theory of coordination the heart and kidneys, VA has been employed to treat heart diseases, including ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and arrhythmia. We examined the effects of VA proteins on primary cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) that were subjected to ischemia-hypoxia (IH) to investigate their effects on and mechanism of action in the treatment of ischemic heart disease. Velvet antler proteins (VA-pro) were extracted with water as the solvent, the ultrasonic wave method, and freeze-drying technology; then it was analyzed by Nano LC-MS/MS. In addition, the role of VA-pro in cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were evaluated by the MTS assay, the EdU assay, the Annexin V-FITC/PI double-staining assay, and the JC-1 assay, respectively. Cell migration were evaluated by the scratch assay and the Transwell assay. The expression of apoptosis-associate proteins, Akt and p-Akt, and tube formation in Matrigel of CMECs were also detected. In total, 386 VA-pro were identified. Our results showed that IH significantly reduced the viability of the CMECs (P < 0.001) and suppressed copies of DNA to hold back CMEC proliferation (P < 0.001). The OD of control group was 1.81 ± 0.08 and IH group OD was 1.25 ± 0.03. After suffering with IH for 46 h, CMECs were 75% less likely to migrate (P < 0.001), and its tubule formation ability and MMP were also decreased (P < 0.001). VA-pro treatment resulted in an improvement in CMECs' viability and proliferation (P < 0.001). Such as, the OD of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/ml rose to 1.56 ± 0.5, 1.74 ± 0.1 and 1.65 ± 0.1, respectively. Similarly, CMECs' migration (for the scratch assay P < 0.001, for the Transwell assay P < 0.05) and tubule formation (P < 0.05) ability were better after treated with VA-pro. At the same time, the stability of MMP was retained preferably (P < 0.001). 50% apoptosis was induced after CMECs were cultured in IH conditions (P < 0.001), while VA-pro decreased the number of apoptotic cells (P < 0.001). All above results showed that 1 mg/ml VA-pro produced maximum results. Furthermore, the expression of pro-apoptosis proteins was higher, but the expression of anti-apoptosis proteins was lower in the IH group (P < 0.05); VA-pro reversed these changes (P < 0.001). These findings suggest that VA-pro ameliorate CMEC injuries induced by IH via regulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway."

The regenerative characteristics of VA have resulted in great research interest, particularly regarding the fields of organ grafting and stem cell differentiation. Various VA proteomic studies verified that proteins act as the primary bioactive components of VA. The present study aimed to investigate if VA proteins (VA‑pro) influence endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) viability. Various methods have previously been used to investigate VA‑pro, including freeze‑drying technology, ultrasonic wave methods, high performance liquid chromatography‑mass spectrometry, EPCs extraction and culture. Results demonstrated that VA‑pro promoted EPCs proliferation and migration, particularly at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Furthermore, VA‑pro increased the activation level of Notch1 intracellular domain and Hes1, and the level of phosphorylated‑Akt and phosphorylated‑mechanistic target of rapamycin. VA‑pro may therefore affect EPC viability via regulation of the Notch and Akt signaling pathways. The present study revealed the effects and potential molecular mechanism of VA‑pro on EPCs, and suggested an association between VA regeneration characteristics and the optimization of EPC viability. These findings may contribute to EPC transplantation research and aid in providing a novel treatment method for vascular diseases in the future.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of the current study was to investigate the potential anti-obesity activity of an enzymatic hydrolysate of velvet antler in inhibiting adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells and in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice. The enzymatic hydrolysate was prepared using the commercial food grade protease, Protamex. The velvet antler Protamex hydrolysate (VAPH) indicated profound inhibitory effects on adipogenesis dose-dependently by decreasing the accumulation of triglycerides and down-regulating expression levels of adipogenesis-related proteins C/EBPα, SREBP-1, and PPARγ. In a mouse model of HFD-induced obesity, oral administration of VAPH (100 and 300 mg/kg for 13 weeks) significantly reduced the body weight gain that had resulted from the HFD. VAPH treatment also lowered the serum glucose and triglyceride levels, while increasing the HDL-C level. Furthermore, the treatment greatly reduced hepatic lipid droplet accumulation as well as the size of adipocytes. Current findings demonstrate that VAPH has profound anti-obesity effects and could be an effective candidate for preventing obesity and obesity-related chronic diseases."

VA was divided into upper (VAU), middle (VAM), and basal sections (VAB). An in vivo study was performed to examine the effect on longitudinal bone growth in adolescent rats. In addition, in vitro osteogenic activities were examined using osteoblastic MG-63 cells. VA promoted longitudinal bone growth and height of the growth plate in adolescent rats. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in growth plate of VA group was highly expressed compared with control. The anabolic effect of VA on bone was further supported by in vitro study. VA enhanced the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of MG-63 cells. The mRNA expressions of osteogenic genes such as collagen, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin were increased by VA treatment. These effects of in vivo and in vitro study were decreased from upper to basal sections of VA. In conclusion, VA treatment promotes longitudinal bone growth in growing rats through enhanced BMP-2 expression, osteogenic activities, and bone matrix gene expressions. In addition, present study provides evidence for the regional differences in the effectiveness of velvet antler for longitudinal bone growth."

      "abstract": "Velvet antlers (VAs) are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine and invigorant and contain many functional components for health promotion. The velvet antler peptide sVAP32 is one of active components in VAs; based on structural study, the sVAP32 interacts with TGF-β1 receptors and disrupts the TGF-β1 pathway. We hypothesized that sVAP32 prevents cardiac fibrosis from pressure overload by blocking TGF-β1 signaling. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or a sham operation. After one month, rats received either sVAP32 (15mg/kg/day) or vehicle for an additional one month. TAC surgery induced significant cardiac dysfunction, fibroblast activation and fibrosis; these effects were improved by treatment with sVAP32. In the heart tissue, TAC remarkably increased the expression of TGF-β1 and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), reactive oxygen species levels, and the phosphorylation levels of Smad2/3 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2). SVAP32 inhibited the increases in reactive oxygen species levels, CTGF expression and the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and ERK1/2, but not TGF-β1 expression. In cultured cardiac fibroblasts, angiotensin II (Ang II) had similar effects compared to TAC surgery, such as increases in α-SMA-positive cardiac fibroblasts and collagen synthesis. SVAP32 eliminated these effects by disrupting TGF-β1 binding to its receptors and blocking Ang II/TGF-β1 downstream signaling. These results demonstrated that sVAP32 has anti-fibrotic effects by blocking the TGF-β1 pathway in cardiac fibroblasts.",

In the present study, velvet antler was subjected to the extraction process using Alcalase protease. We analyzed bioactive components, such as uronic acid, sulfated-glycosaminoglycans (sulfated-GAGs), and sialic acid, present in the velvet antler Alcalase hydrolysate (VAAH) and assessed their anti-inflammatory effects in zebrafish as well as in vitro using cell lines. VAAH mainly contained uronic acid (78.22 mg/g) and sulfated-GAGs (50.47 mg/g), while the amount of sialic acid was negligible (5.55 mg/g). VAAH inhibited the production of nitric oxide (NO) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cells in a dose-dependent manner and the inhibitory effect of VAAH on NO production was higher than that of hot water extracts. VAAH treatment also reduced the expression of inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Furthermore, we evaluated anti-inflammatory effects of VAAH using LPS-stimulated zebrafish. Treatment with LPS significantly increased cell death, NO, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in zebrafish. Notably, VAAH significantly inhibited the extent of LPS-stimulated cell death and generation of NO and ROS in zebrafish. These results suggest that VAAH alleviated inflammation and cell death by inhibiting the generation of ROS induced by LPS treatment. Thus, VAAH could be used as a potential natural remedy with a strong anti-inflammatory effect. Taken together, we believe that based on our present results, enzymatic hydrolysis of velvet antler may be an effective process to make antler products acceptable as elements of health foods and nutraceutical components with increased biological activity."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Velvet antlers (VA) have been claimed for centuries to have numerous medical benefits including strengthen bones. To investigate and compare the anti-osteoporotic activities from different sections of VA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fresh VA prepared from farmed sika deers (Cervus nippon) was divided into upper (VAU), middle (VAM), and basal (VAB) sections. The chemical constituents and anti-osteoporotic effect of different sections from VA were evaluated using ovariectomized rats. RESULTS: Levels of water-soluble extracts, diluted alcoholic extract, amino acids, testosterone, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and testosterone plus estradiol significantly differed among the different sections. Levels of these constituents were significantly higher in the upper section than in the basal section. Moreover, levels of testosterone and IGF-1 of the VAM were also significantly higher than those of the VAB. Calcium level increased downward from the tip with statistical significance. The strength of vertebrae increased in all VA-treated groups compared to the control, but only treatment with VAU and VAM increased the strength of the femur and the microarchitecure of the trabecular bone. Alkaline phosphatase levels of VAU- and VAM-treated groups significantly decreased, but osteocalcin did not significantly change. Moreover, VAU and VAM dose-dependently increased proliferation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells. CONCLUSION: Our study provides strong evidence for the regional differences in the effectiveness of velvet antler in treating osteoporosis. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the bioactive chemical constituents associated with the anti-osteoporotic effects of velvet antler.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The deer velvet antler is well known for its traditional medicinal value, and is widely used in the clinic. It is recorded in the Compendium of Materia Medica that the deer velvet antler replenishes vital essence and strengthens the bone. AIM OF THE STUDY: The goal of this study was to investigate the anti-osteoporotic effect of total velvet antler polypeptides from Cervus elaphus Linnaeus (TVAPL) on ovariectomized rats (OVX), and their possible mechanism of the action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wistar rats were divided into five groups: sham-operated group, OVX group, and OVX rats treated with 20, 40, or 60 mk/kg TVAPL for 12 weeks. Calcium and phosphorus levels, bone weight coefficient (BWC), bone mineral density (BMD), and bone mineral content (BMC) were evaluated. The MTT assay was used to measure the activities of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). In addition, cartilage cells and osteoblast-like cells were exposed to TVAPL, natural velvet antler polypeptides (nVAP), and synthetic velvet antler polypeptides (sVAP), to determine their effects on cell proliferation using the tritiated thymidine incorporation assay. Finally, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the effects of nVAP and sVAP on cytokines related to bone metabolism. RESULTS: The administration of TVAPL for 12 weeks significantly reversed osteoporosis in OVX rats, thereby improving the BWC, BMD, BMC, and bone microarchitecture. IL-1 and IL-6 were significantly activated in the OVX group, and their activation was inhibited by TVAPL. In addition, nVAP and sVAP promoted the proliferation of cartilage and osteoblast-like cells (p<0.01 or p<0.001), and inhibited the secretion of IL-1α from THP-1 monocytic cells in vitro. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that TVAPL are effective in preventing bone loss in OVX rats. The effect of TVAPL on osteoporosis is due to inhibition of IL-1 and IL-6 by nVAP, and promotion of mitosis. sVAP has similar bioactivity as nVAP. Thus, both TVAPL and sVAP may be potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.",

The results using the ovalbumin- (OVA-) sensitized mouse model showed that the levels of total IgE and OVA-specific IgE were reduced after VA powder was administrated for 4 weeks. In addition, the ex vivo results indicated that the secretion of T helper cell 1 (Th1), regulatory T (Treg), and Th17 cytokines by splenocytes was significantly increased (P < 0.05) when VA powder was administered to the mice. Furthermore, OVA-allergic asthma mice that have been orally administrated with VA powder showed a strong inhibition of Th2 cytokine and proinflammatory cytokine production in bronchoalveolar fluid compared to control mice. An increase in the regulatory T-cell population of splenocytes in the allergic asthma mice after oral administration of VA was also observed. All the features of the asthmatic phenotype, including airway inflammation and the development of airway hyperresponsiveness, were reduced by treatment with VA. These findings support the hypothesis that oral feeding of VA may be an effective way of alleviating asthmatic symptoms in humans."

      "abstract": "In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), both velvet antlers (VA) and VA blood can tonify qi, essence, and marrow, nourish the blood, and invigorate bones and tendons. In TCM, the combination of VA and VA blood is believed to have superior pharmacological effects. Scientific evidence supporting the traditional therapeutic preference for redder antler is needed. The effectiveness of the combination therapy of VA middle sections (VAMs) and VA blood (VAM-B) was first examined in promoting proliferation of mouse osteoblastic cells (MC3T3-E1). The anti-osteoporotic activity of VAM-B (ratio of VAM:VA blood = 1:0.2) was evaluated with ovariectomized (OVX) rats at a dose of 0.2 g/kg. In VAM-B-treated OVX rats, the body weight decreased 10.7%, and the strength of vertebrae and the femur respectively increased 18.1% and 15.4%, compared to the control. VAM-B treatment also recovered the estrogen-related loss of the right tibial trabecular bone microarchitecture. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) significantly decreased, but estradiol did not significantly change in serum of VAM-B-treated OVX rats. We also provide an effective strategy to enhance the anti-osteoporotic activity of VAM. In conclusion, our results provide scientific evidence supporting the traditional therapeutic preference of redder antler and indicate that VAM-B is a potential therapeutic agent for managing osteoporosis.",

      "abstract": "Velvet antler of deer (VAD) is a commonly-used kidney-Yang supplementing traditional Chinese medication. According to the heart-kidney-related theory, heart Yang originates in kidney Yang and heart failure due to heart Yang deficiency can be treated by tonifying kidney Yang. In this study, we investigated therapeutic effects of VAD on cardiac functions in rats with heart failure following myocardial infarction. Forty-eight male Wistar rats were subjected either to left coronary artery ligation (N = 36) or to sham operation (N = 12). One week after the surgery, rats with heart failure received daily treatment of double-distilled water, captopril or VAD by gavage for consecutively four weeks, while sham-operated animals were given double-distilled water. Ultrasonic echocardiography was adopted to examine cardiac structural and functional parameters and serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration was measured using radioimmunoassay. We found that VAD partially reversed changes in cardiac functional parameters and serum BNP levels in rats with heart failure. These results provide further evidence for the heart-kidney-related theory and suggest that VAD might be a potentially alternative and complementary medicine for the treatment of heart failure."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of velvet antler polypeptides (VAPs) on osteoarthritic chondrocytes (OCs) in rabbits. METHODS: An osteoarthritic rabbit model was established according to Hulth's method. OCs were isolated and cultured for observation of the cell cycle. Cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay and the cell cycle was monitored by flow cytometry. The phenotype was determined by toluidine blue staining as well as immunohistochemical staining for collagen type II. The expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, TIMP-1, and collagen I and X mRNA by chondrocytes was assayed by RT-PCR. RESULTS: The VAPs had no obvious proliferative effect on OCs and did not affect the cell cycle. However, they significantly reduced the proportion of early apoptotic cells in a dose-dependent manner. Further, VAPs inhibited the expression of collagen I and X mRNA and induced abnormal expression of MMP-1 and MMP-13 mRNA. VAPs had no significant effect on MMP-3 and TIMP-1 mRNA levels. The toluidine blue and collagen type II immunohistochemical staining intensities of VAP-treated chondrocytes were positively correlated with the concentration of VAPs used. CONCLUSION: VAPs had no significant effect on OC proliferation and the cell cycle, but did increase the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen type II expression levels in the extracellular matrix, and down-regulated collagen I and X mRNA expression. Treatment of cartilage cells with VAPs maintained their normal phenotype, inhibited matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) secretion, kept the balance of cartilage matrix metabolism, and sustained an external environment where the cartilage cells could survive. Moreover, VAPs reduced the proportion of early apoptotic cells, suggesting that they may block the apoptotic pathway in OCs.",

The production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12) by lipoteichoic acid was significantly suppressed after being cocultured with the VA extracts in a dose-dependent manner. Animal test in S. aureus-infected mice demonstrated that the numbers of bacteria determined in the kidneys and peritoneal lavage fluid of S. aureus-infected mice were significantly higher than those found in the same organs of mice pretreated with the VA samples. Moreover, the highly enhanced phagocytic activity of macrophages was further verified after in vitro treatment with the VA samples. The protective mechanisms of the VA samples might include an immune enhancer and an inflammatory cytokine suppressor."

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of velvet antler extract (VAE) on the ECM production of dermal fibroblasts cultured in vitro. METHODS: Primary cultured human dermal fibroblasts were treated with VAE, and then the ECM production was determined by RT-PCR, ELISA and Western blot analysis. Furthermore, the change of gene expression according to VAE treatment was evaluated by cDNA microarray. RESULTS: VAE accelerated the growth of fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner. VAE increased the production of several ECM components, including type 1 collagen, fibronectin and elastin. In line with these results, the phosphorylations of p42/44 ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase were markedly increased by VAE, suggesting that the enhancement of ECM production may be linked to the activation of intracellular signaling cascades. VAE also significantly increased cell migration on an in vitro scratch wound test. In cDNA microarray, many genes related with connective tissue integrity were identified to be up-regulated by VAE. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that VAE has a potential to stimulate ECM production, and VAE may be applicable for maintaining the skin's texture."

METHOD: The model rats of myocardial ischemia injury (MI) was produced by ligating the left anterior descending (LAD) branch of the coronary artery of rats. The rats were divided randomly into six groups: sham-operated group; ischemic myocardial injury (MI) model group; diltiazem hydrochloride 1 mg x kg(-1) group; VAP 30 mg x kg(-1) group; VAP 60 mg x kg(-1) group; VAP 120 mg x kg(-1) group. VAP or diltiazem hydrochloride (calcium-antagonist) was injected into the tail vein of each of the experimental rats 12 h and 23 h respectively after left anterior descending (LAD) occlusion. The same volume of saline was administered into the sham-operated group and MI model group. The ischemic size, ST elevation, serum levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate transaminase (AST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and levels of SOD, MDA in myocardial tissue were measured in the rats at 24 h after LAD occlusion. RESULT: The ischemic risk area ratio was 34.52 +/- 8.69% in the MI control group. Treatment of VAP at doses of 60 and 120 mg x kg(-1) resulted in reductions in the infarct size of (21.67 +/- 5.19)% and (19.56 +/- 9.15)% (P < 0.05), respectively. Treatment with VAP at doses of 30, 60 and 120 mg x kg(-1) significantly decreased ST elevation (0.28 +/- 0.03, 0.21 +/- 0.03, 0.16 +/- 0.02, 0.15 +/- 0.02) mV (all P < 0.01), compared with the MI control rats (0.41 +/- 0.05) mV. VAP also significantly decreased levels of CK, LDH, AST, MDA in serum and myocardial tissue, increase SOD activity in serum and myocardial tissue in MI rats. CONCLUSION: VAP exerts significant cardioprotective effects against acute ischemic myocardial injury in rats, likely through its antioxidant and anti-lipid peroxidation properties.",

There were no significant differences between groups on any measures. The pattern of change of the measures across time points was essentially the same for both groups. Although some patients reported clinical improvements in their symptoms, there were no statistically significant differences between groups. Overall, elk velvet antler does not effectively manage residual symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",

      "abstract": "AIMS: To investigate whether copper supplementation to rising 2-year-old red deer stags (Cervus elaphus) in winter and/or spring improved velvet antler weight, grade and financial value, and liveweight gain. METHODS: Rising 2-year-old red deer stags (n=142) on a commercial deer farm in Hawke's Bay were allocated to two groups on May 14, 1996. One group received 20 g boluses of copper-oxide wire particles. On August 15 each group was reallocated in a crossover design, each sub-group receiving either the same copper-oxide treatment or no treatment, to produce control, winter-only, winter-plus-spring, and spring-only copper treatment groups. Blood samples were collected for serum ferroxidase measurements from seven deer per group and all deer were weighed at 4-6-week intervals. Dates of antler casting and velvet removal, and velvet antler weight and grade were recorded, and the financial value of velvet calculated. Livers from a sample of deer slaughtered at the end of the trial mid-December were analysed to determine copper content. RESULTS: Supplementation with copper did not significantly alter velvet antler weight, daily velvet antler growth rate, days from casting to removal, grade or value, or stag liveweight gain. Serum ferroxidase concentrations averaged 10.0-23.7 IU/l in control deer. Copper supplementation increased mean serum ferroxidase concentrations by approximately 10 IU/l. Mean liver copper concentration in control deer was 99 micromol/kg and ranged from 194 to 386 micromol/kg in the three treated groups. CONCLUSION: Group mean serum ferroxidase concentrations of 10 IU/l and above are adequate for optimum velvet production and liveweight gain in rising 2-year-old stags."

METHODS: In Experiment 1, antlers from 50 red deer stags, >or=2-years-old were allocated to 1 of 4 treatment groups (n = 25 antlers/group) to receive injections with 2% lignocaine hydrochloride as follows: High-dose (1 ml/cm pedicle circumference) or Low-dose ring-block (0.4 ml/cm pedicle circumference) or; High-site or Low-site regional nerve block (5 ml per site, both of which included the auriculopalpebral nerve). An electrical stimulus was applied before application of LA and then each min for up to 4 min after LA injection. If no response was observed, analgesia was tested with a saw cut. If no response occurred, the antler was cut at that time. If the animal responded, a further wait time was applied until 4 min had elapsed, at which time observations ceased. In Experiment 2, 10 primary and 50 re-growth antlers were given a High-dose ring-block and tested with a saw cut after 1 min (n = 30) or 2 min (n = 30). If no response occurred, the antler was removed. If a response occurred, further 1-min wait periods were applied. RESULTS: In the High-dose ring-block and High-site nerve-block groups, 24/25 and 21/25 antlers were removed without response by 2 min, compared with 20/25 and 15/25 antlers in the Low-dose ring-block and Low-site nerve-block groups, respectively. The High-dose ring-block provided more effective analgesia after 3 min than the Low-dose ring-block, as assessed by the number of stags that did not respond to the electrical stimulus (p = 0.008), or subsequent antler removal (p = 0.050). The numbers of antlers removed without response after 1 or 2 min were greater using the High-site nerve-block than the Low-site nerve-block (p = 0.002 and p = 0.037, respectively). In all but the High-dose ring-block group, at least 1 stag required further LA after 4 min, before antler could be humanely removed. In Experiment 2, stags reacted to a saw-cut test on 6/30 antlers, 1 min after a High-dose ring-block, compared with 1/30 antlers after 2 min (p = 0.051). CONCLUSION: The High-dose ring-block produced the most effective and rapid analgesia. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A High-dose ring-block with a 2-min wait period should be the preferred method for achieving local analgesia for velvet antler removal."

      "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of various routes of administration and doses of local anaesthetic to provide analgesia of the velvet antler of young stags. METHODS: In study 1, in which an electrical stimulus was used, 64 l-year-old male red and red X wapiti deer with velvet antler lo-30 cm long, were randomly allocated to one of ten treatments with four treatments/animal, and 23 or 24 antlers/treatment. Treatments delivered included three control groups, three local anaesthetic (2% lignocaine HCL) doses delivered by ring block (5, 10 or 15 ml per pedicle), and a high or low regional block with or without an auriculopalpebral nerve block (5 ml per site). An electrical stimulus was applied before and 1,2,4 and 8 minutes after local anaesthetic treatments and to controls, at an increasing voltage until a response was observed. The voltage and animal responses were recorded. In Study 2 the same seven local anaesthetic treatments (16-I 8 antlers/treatment) were evaluated using 58 of the stags from Study 1 when antlers were ready for removal, but a saw cut was used as the test stimulus. A test cut was applied to the antler I,2 and 4 minutes after application of local anaesthetic. If no response was observed, the antler was removed at that time. RESULTS: In Study 1, major dose and treatment effects were significantly different (p < 0.05) with the outcome variable being whether or not the deer responded. No stags given the high dose ring block responded to electrical stimulation 1 minute after treatment, one responded at 2 minutes, and none responded at 4 or 8 minutes. At least one animal responded after all other treatments at all time intervals. More deer responded after the low regional block than the high regional block, and there was a lower response rate when the auriculopalpebral nerves were anaesthetised. In Study 2, no deer responded 2 minutes after the medium dose ring block treatment. Three of 18 stags receiving the high dose ring block still responded after 2 minutes, and one responded after 4 minutes. Responses occurred to all other treatments at each time, with some deer requiring further administration of local anaesthetic before antler removal, even with the four minute waiting period. CONCLUSION: Ring blocks produced more consistent analgesia of the velvet antler than regional nerve blocks. The high dose ring block produced analgesia faster and more effectively than lower doses, and the regional nerve blocks were more effective when the auriculopalpebral nerve was blocked."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Wound repair is a finely orchestrated process involving cellular, molecular, physiologic, and biochemical interactions that restore the integrity of damaged tissue. Cyclic replacement of deer antlers requires rapid regenerative growth, in many ways analogous to that encountered during tissue repair. Molecular mechanisms regulating these processes are not fully understood, but it is increasingly apparent that growth factors are important mediators. Previous studies have shown that elk velvet antler (EVA) contains various growth factors and that a water-soluble extract stimulates dermal fibroblast growth in vitro. DESIGN: The efficacy of EVA water-soluble extract on wound healing in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats was EVAluated using a full-thickness cutaneous wound model. Animals were randomly selected to receive topical application of either control or EVA gel. Daily photographs of the wounds served to measure the rate of wound closure. Wound-edge biopsies obtained on postoperative days 2 and 10 allowed histologic evaluation and measurement of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta (1)) concentrations by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. RESULTS: Wounds treated with the EVA topical gel were significantly smaller by postoperative day 6. TGF- beta (1) protein expression was not different in EVA-treated wounds compared to control wounds. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that topical treatment with an EVA water-soluble extract accelerates repair of cutaneous wounds in diabetic rats. Further studies are warranted to reveal the mechanisms involved in EVA enhancement of wound closure and to determine if this compound is an economical pharmacologic agent in the treatment of normal and compromised wounds.",

Behavioral and physiological responses to treatment application and antler removal were recorded, and blood was collected for cortisol analysis. During application of L and C, increases in mean heart rate and systolic arterial blood pressure were greater in the C treatment group (P < 0.05, and P = 0.05, respectively). When antler was removed, more behavioral responses occurred in the C treatment group (P = 0.02) and its median behavior score was higher (P = 0.03).

Morphine-induced analgesic action was measured by tail-flick method. Morphine-induced hyperactivity and reverse tolerance were evidenced by measuring the enhanced ambulatory activity using a tilting-type ambulometer. Dopamine (DA) receptor supersensitivity in mice displaying morphine-induced reverse tolerance was evidenced by the enhanced response in ambulatory activity to the DA agonist, apomorphine. The repeated administration of VAWE significantly inhibits the development of morphine-induced analgesic tolerance, physical dependence, reverse tolerance and postsynaptic DA receptor supersensitivity. But a single administration of VAWE did neither antagonize morphine-induced analgesia nor inhibit morphine-induced hyperactivity.

CPP effects were evaluated assessing the increased time spent by the mice to morphine and the inhibition of CPP by the decreased time spent by the mice in the nonpreferred compartment. Postsynaptic DA receptor supersensitivity in mice displaying a morphine-induced CPP was evidenced by the enhanced response in ambulatory activity to the DA agonist. The oral administration of velvet antler water extract (VAWE) from Cerrus elaphus, prior to the morphine treatment in mice inhibited the development of morphine-induced CPP and postsynaptic DA receptor supersensitivity. These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of VAWE on morphine-induced CPP may be closely related to the recovery of dysfunction in the dopaminergic system produced by morphine because both phenomena were inhibited by VAWE. But a single administration of VAWE did not inhibit apomorphine-induced climbing behavior, indicating that antidopaminergic activity was not produced by a single administration of VAWE at the postsynaptic DA receptors. From the above results, it is presumed that VAWE may be useful for prevention and therapy of the adverse actions of morphine.",

      "abstract": "Heart rate and behaviour during and following velvet antler removal were monitored in yearling red deer stags to determine the extent to which this procedure was perceived by the deer to be aversive. Nine stags normally kept at pasture were habituated over 5 weeks to the following daily handling procedure. Each deer was fitted with a harness containing a heart rate monitor. It was then allowed to run through a fixed course in a deer yard, restrained for 40 s in a mechanical deer crush, and then confined for 3.5 h with the remainder of the group of stags in an indoor pen containing food and water. In Week 6, the deer were subjected to either restraint for 6 minutes (the control treatment) or removal of one velvet antler under local anaesthesia. Each velvet antler was removed on separate occasions, either on Days 1 and 2 (five deer) or Days 3 and 4 (four deer). The control treatment was applied to all deer when velvet antler was not being removed, and on Day 5. Heart rate and behaviour (time taken to enter the treatment area, and number of struggles made during restraint) were measured before and during treatment, and post-treatment activities were recorded at 0, 1 and 3 h (indoors), and at 6 and 9 h (at pasture). Heart rate was higher during the second velvet antler removal treatment than during the first, but lower during the second control treatment than the first (P<0.05). During velvet antler removal, stags struggled more, and after the treatment flicked their ears, shook their heads, and groomed themselves more than control stags (P<0.05). Stags whose velvet antler had been removed spent less time eating than control stags, and spent progressively more time sitting during the 3.5 h of confinement (P<0.05). However, during the paddock observation at 9 h post-treatment, stags which had had their velvet antler removed grazed more than control stags (P<0.05). The increase in heart rate over the two velvet antler removal treatments and the greater amount of struggling during velvet antler removal indicated that it was more aversive than the control treatment. Post-treatment differences in behaviour may have been due to pain following velvet antler removal."
