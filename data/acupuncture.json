      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies of acupuncture for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have focused on lowering blood glucose and improving symptoms; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects have not been systematically reviewed. Acupuncture can improve impaired glucose-lipid metabolism and correct insulin resistance (IR) by modulating relevant pathway cytokines, which are both key process in T2DM pathogenesis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess the efficacy of acupuncture in an animal model of T2DM. METHODS: Three researchers identified animal studies of acupuncture intervention in T2DM by searching nine databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Ovide Medline, BIOSIS Previews , Wan Fang, CNKI, and VIP. Literature that met the inclusion criteria was screened, required data were extracted, and meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4 and Stata 17.0. RESULTS: A total of 31 studies with 619 animals were included-309 in the acupuncture group and 310 in the model group-all of which were male rodents. The mean quality score of the studies was 3.7, which indicated low quality. Meta-analysis showed that first acupuncture led to a significant reduction in body weight gain and hematological factors, and reduced food intake and water intake in T2DM animals. Second acupuncture significantly reduced blood glucose and serum insulin, increased insulin sensitivity, and decreased IR index in T2DM animals. Finally acupuncture had the following beneficial effects on the insulin signaling pathway and mitochondrial AMPK pathway: (1) insulin signaling pathway: Acupuncture can balance the phosphorylation levels of IRS-1 tyrosine 895 and IRS-1 serine/threonine 307 and promote the expression of all factors of the insulin signaling pathway, namely, IRS-1 mRNA, p-IRS-1, PI3K p85, PI3K mRNA, AKT, p-AKT, GLUT 4, and GLUT 4 mRNA-promoting glucose uptake, alleviating IR, and ameliorating impaired glucose metabolism. (2) Mitochondrial AMPK pathway: acupuncture significantly promoted AMPK, AMPK mRNA, p-AMPK, SIRT1, SIRT1 mRNA, PGC-1α, PGC-1α mRNA and NRF1, improved mitochondrial dysfunction, enhanced glucose metabolism, and alleviated T2DM symptoms. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture can improve glucose-lipid metabolism, enhance insulin sensitivity, and correct IR, likely by promoting the expression of signaling factors in the insulin and mitochondrial AMPK pathways. These findings offer potential explanations for the mechanism of action and clinical effects of acupuncture in the treatment of T2DM."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND:   There is often a disconnect between standard medical treatment in the United States and complementary therapies such as acupuncture. While acupuncture has gained public attention, its integration into mainstream U.S. healthcare remains limited. Physicians rarely refer patients to acupuncture, and the profession is not well integrated into the American healthcare system. Despite the increasing number of licensed non-physician acupuncturists and accredited acupuncture programs, practitioners in private outpatient settings face significant challenges when attempting to integrate into inpatient hospital environments. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the opportunities and barriers to mainstreaming acupuncture in the U.S. healthcare system by conducting a needs assessment among both licensed non-physician acupuncturists and mainstream medical practitioners. METHODS: A mixed-methods design was employed, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. Licensed acupuncturists and mainstream medical professionals participated in surveys and interviews to assess the factors influencing acupuncture's integration into mainstream medicine. RESULTS: Findings from the needs assessment highlighted several barriers to acupuncture integration. Key challenges included inconsistencies in professional competence among acupuncture practitioners, particularly in terms of knowledge, skills, and abilities, as well as a lack of awareness among mainstream medical professionals regarding reliable, evidence-based acupuncture treatments. CONCLUSION: The results underscore the need for standardization in acupuncture education and greater awareness of its evidence-based benefits among mainstream medical professionals. Addressing these barriers may facilitate acupuncture's integration into the U.S. healthcare system and improve interdisciplinary collaboration in patient care."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the United States, acupuncture education is divided into two primary pathways: medical acupuncture for licensed physicians and traditional acupuncture rooted in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for nonphysician practitioners. These pathways reflect the distinct educational needs and historical development of acupuncture in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To compare medical and traditional acupuncture educational systems, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and the potential for integration to enhance patient care. METHODS: This narrative review utilized comprehensive literature searches, analyzing peer-reviewed articles, institutional reports, and accreditation documents. The study focused on programs approved by the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture and accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine. RESULTS: Medical acupuncture programs are shorter and emphasize evidence-based practice, allowing physicians to integrate acupuncture into conventional medical treatment. These programs focus on Western medical terminology and concepts but may lack depth in TCM principles. Traditional acupuncture programs offer extensive training in TCM principles and practices, including herbal medicine, with comprehensive clinical training but may lack emphasis on modern medical science and research-based evidence. There is a significant workforce disparity between licensed traditional acupuncturists and the much smaller number of medical acupuncturists in practice. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating both educational pathways can enhance patient care through comprehensive treatment approaches. Successful integration examples demonstrate improved patient outcomes. Future efforts should focus on developing joint training programs, promoting research collaboration, and increasing hospital-based internships to foster interdisciplinary learning and practice."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is not regulated in the United Kingdom, and in this review article, we look at how voluntary regulation, predicated on accredited degree-level acupuncture courses, is structured for professional nonphysician acupuncturists. These are practitioners for whom acupuncture is their primary mode of treatment, and who do not have an additional medical qualification. OVERVIEW OF EDUCATION: We describe how acupuncture education is set up and accredited, at the common syllabus shared by accredited acupuncture colleges, and how best teaching practices are employed. REGULATION: Patient safety is an essential component of any healthcare training program, and we explore how professional acupuncturists meet the same standards required of other healthcare professionals through registration with the UK government Professional Standards Authority. There are also a number of nonaccredited courses available within the United Kingdom that do not meet this standard, and we explain how a patient can ensure that they find an appropriately qualified practitioner. IMPACT BEYOND THE UK: The voluntary accreditation system that underpins the high-level college education available in the United Kingdom also makes it possible for there to be reciprocal agreements with organisations globally, such as the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine in the United States. These reciprocal agreements allow students from around the world to come to the United Kingdom to train, knowing that their qualifications will be recognized in their home country."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Effective treatments for preventing and treating chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) are still under exploration. Acupuncture in the treatment of CIPN requires more clinical trial data. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of acupuncture on CIPN and explore its efficacy and safety in improving peripheral neuropathy. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted from May 2021 to June 2023. Eligible patients were randomly divided into a verum acupuncture group and a sham acupuncture group at a 1:1 ratio with sealed opaque envelopes. The patients of both the two groups took oral mecobalamin tablets, 0.5 mg, three times a day for 2 weeks. Participants received acupuncture treatment three times a week for 2 weeks. The primary outcome was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) 3.0. The secondary outcomes were assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-CIPN twenty-item subscale (QLQ-CIPN20), Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome score, and nerve conduction study (NCS) testing. Assessments were conducted at baseline, 1 week, and 2 weeks. RESULTS: All 70 participants were recruited and randomized. In the end, 68 patients were included in the datasets and received verum acupuncture (n = 34) or sham acupuncture (n = 34). After 2 weeks of treatment and follow-up, a statistically significant difference was found in the NCI-CTCAE scores between the two groups (p = 0.02). Baseline-to-2-week assessment scores improved significantly in the intervention group (vs. controls) on EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 (p = 0.02), NRS scores (p = 0.03), TCM syndrome scores (p = 0.04), and sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) of median and peroneal nerves, sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) and motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) of peroneal nerves (p < 0.05). No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: This study supports the feasibility of acupuncture combined with medication as an intervention for patients with CIPN and confirms its efficacy and safety in improving peripheral neuropathy.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Poor ovarian response (POR) refers to a pathological condition where the ovaries respond inadequately to gonadotropin stimulation during ovulation induction. The decline in both the quantity and quality of available oocytes makes achieving pregnancy through IVF-ET more challenging. Several studies have demonstrated that acupuncture can improve embryo quality, increase the number of high-quality embryos, and enhance pregnancy outcomes in IVF-ET patients, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which acupuncture influences early embryo development in POR mice after IVF-ET through whole-transcriptome sequencing. METHODS: We established POR mice model and performed acupuncture treatment. Fresh denuded oocytes were retrieved and transplanted via IVF-ET into new donor female mice to obtain early-stage embryo tissues. Vaginal smear tests were conducted to monitor estrous cycle changes, while oocyte retrieval, ovarian wet weight, and ovarian index were assessed. Serum concentrations of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), and luteinizing hormone (LH) were measured via ELISA. Histopathological changes and apoptosis in the ovaries were evaluated using HE and TUNEL staining. Whole-transcriptome sequencing was employed to establish expression profiles of differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs), DEmiRNAs, DElncRNAs, and DEcircRNAs. The circ/lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was constructed to analyze the biological functions and potential mechanisms of acupuncture on early embryo development post-IVF-ET in POR mice. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that acupuncture improved ovarian function in POR mice, corrected serum hormone imbalances, and alleviated abnormal apoptosis in ovarian granulosa cells. Through whole-transcriptome sequencing, we identified 685 DEmRNAs, 13 DEmiRNAs, 325 DElncRNAs, and 4 DEcircRNAs exhibiting regulatory trends. By constructing the circ/lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network, we found that miR-291a-3p, miR-294-3p, and miR-295-3p may serve as key targets influencing early embryo development via multiple pathways, including the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway and p53 signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: Overall, our study is the first to reveal the molecular mechanisms by which acupuncture improves early embryo development under POR conditions, providing new evidence for the use of acupuncture in assisted reproduction.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is clinically effective in the treatment of ischemic stroke. The report suggests that energy stress inhibits ferroptosis in part through AMPK. However, whether the effect of activating AMPK is related to ferroptosis in ischemic stroke and whether acupuncture can achieve neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury through the pathway of inhibiting ferroptosis by activating AMPK has not been confirmed. METHODS: In this experiment, all rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: Sham group, MCAO/R group, MA (MCAO/R + acupuncture) group, and MAM (MCAO/R + acupuncture + metformin) group. The middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion injury (MCAO/R) model was created by the wire embolism method, and the MA and MAM groups received acupuncture treatment with electrotherapy (1 mA, 2/15 Hz, 20 min each), while the MAM group continued to receive metformin (oral gavage 200 mg/kg) after successful modelling. Neurological deficit score and infarct volume were measured, Prussian blue staining and mitochondrial structural changes were observed, and Fe2+ and MDA levels were determined in the brain tissue of the rats. Western blot results were analyzed to determine differences in the expression of TFR1, SLC7A11, GPX4 and AMPK、p-AMPK proteins in order to explore the possible pathological processes involved in cerebral ischemia at behavioral, histological and molecular levels and the possible protective mechanisms of acupuncture. RESULTS: Acupuncture attenuated ischemia-reperfusion-induced brain damage and mitochondrial damage. Further studies showed that acupuncture reduced the levels of Fe2+, MDA and the expression of TFR1 protein and increased the expression of SLC7A11 and GPX4 protein in the diseased hippocampal region of MCAO/R rats. In addition, metformin, as an AMPK activator, significantly enhanced the protective effect of acupuncture on cerebral ischemic injury and enhanced the acupuncture-mediated reduction of Fe2+, MDA levels and TFR1 protein expression and the increase of SLC7A11 and GPX4 protein expression in the lesioned hippocampal region of MCAO/R rats. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that acupuncture can inhibit ferroptosis and thus exert a protective effect against ischemic brain injury, and that this mechanism may be achieved by activating AMPK. This extends the mechanism of action of acupuncture in the treatment of ischemic stroke."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stroke remains a leading cause of long-term disability globally, often complicated by cardiovascular comorbidities such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. These comorbidities not only increase the risk of recurrent strokes but also complicate recovery, making effective rehabilitation strategies crucial. Acupuncture, a traditional Chinese medicine practice, has gained attention as a potential complementary therapy for stroke rehabilitation. This protocol outlines a pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed at evaluating the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in improving neurological function, quality of life, and reducing stroke recurrence in stroke survivors with cardiovascular comorbidities. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This pooled analysis will adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We will include RCTs that assess acupuncture interventions compared to placebo acupuncture, standard care, or no intervention in adult stroke survivors with at least one cardiovascular comorbidity. Comprehensive literature searches will be conducted in databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and CINAHL, covering all studies published from inception to the most recent update. Two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts, and full-text articles will be reviewed to confirm eligibility. Data extraction will focus on participant characteristics, intervention specifics, outcomes related to neurological function, quality of life, stroke recurrence, and adverse events. The risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. A random-effects meta-analysis will be conducted to account for heterogeneity across studies, and subgroup analyses will explore the impact of different stroke types, cardiovascular comorbidities, and acupuncture techniques on outcomes. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the role of acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment for stroke rehabilitation in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. The findings are expected to contribute to the evidence base regarding the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in this specific patient population, potentially influencing clinical practice guidelines and promoting the integration of acupuncture into standard stroke care protocols. Despite the potential benefits, challenges such as variability in acupuncture techniques and patient characteristics across studies may affect the generalizability of the results. Nevertheless, this study will offer valuable insights into optimizing rehabilitation strategies for stroke survivors with complex clinical profiles. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NO: CRD42024576156."

On arrival, the patient was alert and oriented, with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 148/89 mmHg, and 92% peripheral oxygen saturation upon 5 L/min oxygen administration via a face mask in room air. Decreased breath sounds were noted bilaterally. Skin findings on the chest and back were normal. Computed tomography before drainage revealed bilateral pneumothorax with slight subcutaneous emphysema around the fifth and sixth ribs in the left chest (Fig. 1). Bilateral chest drains were inserted, which resulted in rapid improvement in respiratory status and good lung re-expansion. The drains were removed four days later, and the patient was discharged."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Thrombolytic therapy remains the standard treatment for acute ischemic stroke. The narrow window for thrombolysis means that delay in treatment worsens brain injury. Astrocytes regulate blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and neuroinflammation, yet their neurotoxic polarization exacerbates injury in neuropathological conditions, including ischemic stroke. Delayed recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) thrombolysis disrupts astrocyte homeostasis, further aggravating brain injury. This study investigates whether acupuncture, a key therapy in traditional Chinese medicine, alleviates delayed thrombolysis-induced injury by modulating astrocyte neurotoxic polarization and elucidates the underlying signaling pathway. METHODS: A rat model of embolic stroke with delayed rt-PA thrombolysis was established. The effects of infarct volume, BBB integrity, and neuroinflammation of acupuncture were evaluated. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomic analyses were performed to assess astrocyte-specific transcriptional changes. Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and pharmacological inhibition experiments validated molecular mechanisms. RESULTS: Acupuncture reduced infarct volume, improved neurological function, and restored BBB integrity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed dynamic regulation of astrocyte neurotoxic polarization following acupuncture intervention. Further validation experiments demonstrated that acupuncture suppressed the ERK1/2-Cx43 cascade, thereby attenuating astrocyte-mediated neurotoxicity. Pharmacological modulation of this pathway replicated the protective effects of acupuncture, highlighting the role in mitigating astrocyte dysfunction and promoting BBB recovery. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture mitigates delayed thrombolysis-induced brain injury by modulating astrocyte polarization via the ERK1/2-Cx43 pathway. These findings highlight acupuncture as a potential strategy to enhance thrombolytic therapy safety in ischemic stroke."

Acupuncture has promising effects on ACI, but its efficacy and safety need to be verified through well-designed randomized clinical trials. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture as adjunctive therapy to improve neurological function in patients with ACI. METHODS: The multicenter, sham-controlled, patient- and assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted in 4 tertiary hospitals in China from January to September 2024. All participants received standard care as recommended by the guidelines and were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to manual acupuncture (MA), sham acupuncture (SA), or standard care (SC) only. Participants in the MA and SA groups received acupuncture treatment 6 times weekly for 2 weeks for a total of 12 sessions. The primary outcome was the change in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score from baseline to 14 days. Safety outcomes included adverse events and serious adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients (median [IQR] age, 65 [58-69] years; 96 men [72.73%]), with a median (IQR) baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 11 (9-12) points, were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Ten patients withdrew during the 14-day intervention, and another 7 patients withdrew during the 90-day follow-up. During the 14-day intervention, the median neurological impairment was significantly improved in the MA group compared to the SA group (4 [3, 5] vs. 3 [1.25, 4] points; Cohen's d, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.33 to 1.19; p = 0.001). Adverse events occurred relatively equally between the MA and SA groups (19 [43.2%] vs. 13 [29.5%]; relative risk, 1.46; 95% CI, 0.83 to 2.58; p = 0.184). CONCLUSION: Twelve sessions of MA were safe and effective in improving the neurological function of patients with ACI. The results of this trial indicate that MA can be recommended as a routine, supplemental therapy for improving neurological function in patients with ACI.

The purpose of the study is to assess whether acupuncture can successfully relieve the age-related decline in female fertility. This will provide substantial proof in support of the therapeutic effectiveness of acupuncture. METHODS: This is a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. There will be 108 participants diagnosed with DOR recruited in China. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to two groups, including acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups. The participants will receive acupuncture treatments three times a week, each lasting 30 minutes, for 36 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in ovarian function modeling as assessed by four metrics: age, ovarian reserve markers such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) in the Ovarian Reserve Function Prediction Tool (OvaRePred). Secondary outcomes will include changes in the antral follicle count (AFC), serum sex hormone levels, Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS). Adverse events (AEs) associated with acupuncture will be documented following each treatment session. AEs will be monitored and reported to ensure patient safety throughout the trial. EXPECTED RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We will be able to measure the effectiveness of acupuncture for patients with DOR and whether acupuncture is superior to sham acupuncture. The proposed acupuncture treatment might provide an alternative option for those patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2400086376."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in alleviating gait disturbances in post-stroke hemiplegia, focusing on various gait parameters. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, AMED, CINAHL, CBM, CNKI, and WanFang databases to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The included studies were independently evaluated for risk of bias using Cochrane's risk of bias tool. RevMan 5.3 was used for meta-analysis, and adverse events were collected through full-text review. RESULTS: A total of 21 RCTs involving 1463 participants were included. Results showed that acupuncture combined with rehabilitation therapy (RT) significantly improved stride and step length (MD = 7.79, 95 % CI: 5.62-9.96, Z = 7.03, P < 0.00001, I² = 72 %), cadence (MD = 10.43, 95 % CI: 6.22-14.65, Z = 4.85, P < 0.00001, I² = 95 %), walking speed (MD = 12.27, 95 % CI: 9.22-15.31, Z = 7.90, P < 0.00001, I² = 91 %), hip peak flexion angle (MD = 2.71, 95 % CI: 0.94-4.49, Z = 2.99, P = 0.003, I² = 82 %), and ankle peak plantarflexion angle (MD = 2.08, 95 % CI: 1.11-3.06, Z = 4.19, P < 0.0001, I² = 0 %) compared to RT alone. It also reduced gait cycle time (MD = -0.61, 95 % CI: -0.96 to -0.26, Z = 3.44, P = 0.0006, I² = 98 %) and the proportion of double support phase (MD = -7.16, 95 % CI: -9.08 to -5.25, Z = 7.33, P < 0.00001, I² = 0 %). These improvements in gait parameters suggest enhanced mobility and functional independence for post-stroke patients. However, heterogeneity in participant characteristics and study methodologies was noted, such as variations in stroke types, curses, severity, and acupuncture protocols. The majority of RCTs exhibited moderate to high risk of bias regarding allocation concealment and blinding. Only two RCTs reported no adverse events, while the rest 19 studies did not mention adverse events. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture appears to enhance specific aspects of hemiplegic gait, though further high-quality research is needed to fully validate its effects. Current evidence is limited by methodological weaknesses and potential biases in the included studies. Rigorous, well designed studies are needed to further validate the comprehensive effects of acupuncture on post-stroke hemiplegic gait."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adenomyosis (AM) is a common gynecological disorder frequently observed in women of reproductive age. It is characterized by the invasion of endometrial glands and stroma into the myometrium, often manifesting as secondary dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and infertility. Although hormonal therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) remain the mainstream treatments, their long-term efficacy and side effects pose significant clinical challenges. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), particularly herbal medicine and acupuncture, has emerged as a safer alternative therapy. CASE SUMMARY: A 39-year-old Asian woman presented to our hospital with a 10-year history of progressively worsening menstrual pain, accompanied by menstrual hypermenorrhea over the past 2 years. She was diagnosed with adenomyosis. According to traditional Chinese medicine theory, the diagnosis was dysmenorrhea associated with the Qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome. Notably, despite treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, her dysmenorrhea remained unresponsive. The patient was treated with a modified herbal formula, Guizhi Fuling Wan (GZFLW), and acupuncture. After three menstrual cycles of treatment, her dysmenorrhea and other systemic symptoms significantly improved. At the time of writing this report, no recurrence had been observed during follow-up, and no adverse reactions occurred throughout the entire treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: The success of this case indicates that traditional Chinese medicine can serve as an independent treatment option for secondary dysmenorrhea caused by adenomyosis, offering a viable alternative to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It holds unique value and significant clinical importance for patients who are unresponsive to NSAIDs and refuse hormone-based therapies. However, further rigorous clinical trials are needed to validate these findings."

This study aimed to review TKM-CPGs to characterize the range of conditions for which BVA is recommended, summarize the level of evidence and recommendation grades, and assess the factors influencing the grades. Eighteen TKM-CPGs, including 30 BVA-related recommendations, were identified. Data on targeted diseases/symptoms, treatment protocols, evidence levels, and recommendation grades were extracted. The CPGs recommended BVA for musculoskeletal and neurological disorders in standalone or combined therapy. Most of the evidence for BVA recommendations was evaluated with low to moderate levels based on randomized controlled trials. The grades of recommendations were mostly B or C, indicating that BVA is advisable or potentially beneficial. Although the CPGs offer some guidance on treatment protocols for BVA, there remains a lack of detailed specifications, and we need to conduct additional research to provide evidence. Also, the heterogeneity of recommendations across different CPGs presents a challenge in establishing consistent clinical guidelines. Future research should focus on generating high-quality evidence and standardizing treatment regimens to support more robust recommendations for BVA in TKM clinical practice.",

We describe a case of typical traveler's diarrhea in a 44-year-old tourist in Cuba, who was treated with acupuncture in addition to rehydration, without the use of any medication (e.g., antibiotics or anti-motility agents). On the seventh day of the trip, the traveler developed sudden onset, profuse watery diarrhea with mild nausea. During a period of eight hours, the patient passed profuse watery stools five times. Two standard acupuncture needles (0.30 x 30 mm) were inserted by an anesthesiologist trained in acupuncture: one at ST36 (stomach meridian 36) on the left leg and one at LI4 (large intestine meridian 4) on the right hand, for a duration of 30-40 minutes. The exact session was repeated a second time after two days. After each session, a decrease in the frequency (defecation only once per day) and severity of diarrhea (stool consistency improved as per the Bristol scale) was observed. Further research on the effectiveness of ST36 and LI4 points acupuncture and acupressure for the symptomatic management of traveler's diarrhea by means of randomized controlled trials is needed, given the lack of contribution to antimicrobial resistance, the low cost, and the minimal equipment needed for acupuncture and acupressure therapy. If confirmed, such an additional treatment option could be useful in rural, remote, or poor resource settings where the availability of antidiarrheal medications might be limited."

Studies show acupuncture helps manage IBS-D symptoms though researchers do not understand if specific treatment points in the abdomen provide better outcomes than standard acupuncture points in the lower body regions. The study investigates the effects acupuncture treatments using local and systemic needling techniques have on IBS-D symptom expression and gut microbial diversity features. METHODS: The study employs a randomized controlled single-blinded exploratory clinical trial design which includes 36 participants diagnosed with IBS-D via Rome IV criteria. Participants are randomly allocated to one of three groups: abdominal acupuncture, lower limb acupuncture, or standard treatment. Participants who receive acupuncture treatment receive eight sessions which are distributed throughout 4 weeks as clinicians activate specific points connected to gastrointestinal function. Lifestyle education and approved medications with symptom management make up the standard treatment provided to participants. The main outcome measures assess IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS) score changes from baseline at Week 5. Additional evaluation measures in this study comprise stool consistency examination alongside patient global assessments and cold-heat surveys along with EQ-5D-5L quality of life assessment and gut microbiota examination as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Research has been designed to evaluate how abdominal and lower limb acupuncture techniques compare in symptom relief and microbiota adaptation outcomes. The preliminary data is expected to reveal distinct patterns between local and wide-reaching effects which suggests that IBS-D treatment should be tailored on a personal basis. CONCLUSION: The comparison of abdominal and lower limb acupuncture treatment efficacy adds to our understanding of acupuncture therapy benefit for IBS-D. The results will help guide clinical practice and support the creation of tailored acupuncture treatments.",

The disorder's pathophysiology involves a range of factors including genetic mutations, neurochemical imbalances, and structural abnormalities in the brain. Acupuncture has emerged as a promising complementary treatment for various types of dystonia, including post-stroke, cerebral palsy (CP)-related, limb, and cervical dystonia, as well as other hyperkinetic movement disorders. Clinical studies indicate that acupuncture may help to alleviate symptoms, decrease muscle spasticity, and improve overall patient outcomes. However, the effectiveness of acupuncture can vary depending on the specific type and severity of dystonia, with some studies reporting significant improvements, while others show more modest results. The variability in treatment response highlights the need for more robust research to better understand the mechanisms underlying acupuncture's effects and to develop standardized treatment protocols. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of dystonia's pathophysiology and to assess the current evidence on the role of acupuncture in its treatment, identifying areas in which further research is needed to optimize therapeutic approaches."

METHODS: Randomized controlled trials of acupuncture-related therapies for PMOP were searched in eight databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science and Technology Journal Database, China Biomedical Literature Database, and Wanfang database) from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2023. Our primary outcomes included overall clinical effectiveness rate, bone mineral density (BMD), and visual analog scale scores (VAS). The secondary outcome is adverse events. The entire process of literature screening and data analysis was conducted by 2 independent investigators. RESULTS: A total of 30 studies with 2,342 participants provided data suitable for analysis. We compared six interventions: manual acupuncture, electroacupuncture, acupoint catgut embedding, moxibustion, acupoint application, and warm acupuncture. The results of the network meta-analysis revealed that, when compared to conventional Western medication (CWM), multiple acupuncture therapies had a greater impact on the overall clinical effectiveness rate. Electroacupuncture combined with CWM demonstrated superior clinical effectiveness and lumbar spine BMD improvement. Moxibustion with CWM ranked highest for femoral neck BMD, while warm acupuncture showed optimal effects on Ward's triangle and trochanter BMD. Acupoint catgut embedding provided the greatest pain reduction. The most prevalent minor adverse effects included hematoma, discomfort, and scorching. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that several acupuncture-related therapies, either alone or in conjunction with CWM, outperform CWM alone and may be regarded as an alternative or supplementary therapy to PMOP, though higher-quality trials are needed."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of acupuncture treatment based on the principles of primary point selection, local point selection, and syndrome differentiation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: RA patients recruited from the rheumatology department of our hospital between January 2022 and January 2024 were randomly assigned to either the sham acupuncture group or the acupuncture group. The sham group received medication combined with sham acupuncture, while the acupuncture group received medication combined with acupuncture based on the principles above. Comparisons were made on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome scores, quality of life, clinical symptoms, and inflammatory status after 4 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 65 patients in the acupuncture group and 66 in the sham group were analyzed. The acupuncture group showed a substantially higher total effective rate than the sham group, underscoring a significant advantage in treatment efficacy (81.56% vs. 60.61%). After treatment, the reduction in TCM syndrome scores in the acupuncture group was greater by 1.16 compared to the sham group (95% CI: 0.21-2.12). Following treatment, both groups showed notable improvements, as shown by notable decreases in their Disease Activity Score for 28 joints and Health Assessment Questionnaire ratings. The acupuncture group reported significantly lower scores than the sham group (all p < 0.05). Additionally, rheumatoid factor, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels were decreased in both groups. All of the results were statistically significant (all p < 0.05). However, the acupuncture group had significantly lower levels of these markers than the sham group. This suggests that acupuncture has a stronger therapeutic impact when treating illness. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture treatment based on primary point selection, local point selection, and syndrome differentiation significantly alleviates clinical symptoms and inflammatory states in patients with RA, thereby improving quality of life.",

DESIGN: Cross-sectional meta-epidemiological study. DATA SOURCES: We comprehensively searched for eligible studies between 1 January 2014 and 1 May 2024, in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CBM, CNKI, Wanfang Data and VIP Database. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: RCTs that used acupuncture as the intervention group to obtain the efficacy and/or safety of acupuncture therapy. Acupuncture therapy should be based on Traditional Medicine theory. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed (1) the general characteristics of acupuncture RCTs; (2) the general characteristics of PROs; (3) the reporting scores of PROs by the Extension of Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials of Patient-Reported Outcomes (CONSORT PRO Extension); (4) the general characteristic of A-AEs; (5) the incidence of A-AEs. RESULTS: We included 476 studies in this study. 296 (62.2%) used PROs as study outcomes, 272 (57.1%) reported safety outcomes. The Visual Analogue Scale (149, 23.7%) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (42, 6.7%) were the most common PROs reported. The reporting of PROs was incomplete, with sufficiently reporting scores ranging from 2.7% to 97.6% across the CONSORT PRO Extension. 164 studies reported A-AEs, of which 141 reported specific details, and we found that the OR for the incidence of AEs in the acupuncture group compared to the control group was 1.434 (95% CI 1.148 to 1.793). We identified 1277 reports of A-AEs in eligible studies, predominantly tissue injury (eg, haematoma, bleeding), irritation (eg, pain, post-acupuncture discomfort), with no reports of serious A-AEs. The reporting of A-AEs lacked details on the acquisition methods (15.5%), occurrence time (5.5%), A-AEs' treatment (18.1%) and A-AEs' recovery (19.7%). Studies that reported funding, registry information, acupuncturist qualifications and non-significant primary outcomes were associated with the A-AEs' reporting, and the difference was statistically significant (p≤0.05). CONCLUSION: This study found that the reporting of PROs and A-AEs was insufficient in acupuncture RCTs. Future studies should clarify the clinical significance of using PROs as outcomes and report AEs comprehensively to provide patients with sufficient information on the benefits and harms of acupuncture treatments."

However, the proportion of patients in a real-world setting who regain normal health after 1 year, following De-Qi acupuncture is unknown. METHODS: This is an observational prospective study of 354 new patients in a family medical practice between 2015 and 2018. Patients self-assessed pain using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and health using the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) before treatment and at 3- and 12-months of follow-up. VAS and SF-36 components were compared for improvements and therapeutic effect sizes. Propensity score matching was employed to avoid bias by confounding variables. RESULTS: The participation rate was 29%, median age 50 years (range 20-79), 65% were females, median pain duration was 18 months (6-360), the median number of acupuncture treatments was 6 (1-27). The initial VAS pain intensity of 6.2 (SD 2.5) improved to 4.0 at 3 months and 3.2 at 12 months (p < .001, large effect size); SF-36 scores also improved. 75% of patients showed strong responses, with 58% reaching complete cure and 17% achieving near-normal health. Patients aged >65 responded well and ≥6 treatments were associated with stronger responses than 1-5. Hill criteria analysis of improvements with acupuncture suggested causation over association. CONCLUSION: In patients with chronic pain (median 18 months), who were unresponsive to conventional treatments, De-Qi acupuncture was associated with sustained pain reduction and health improvements. Most attained Norwegian national normal health standards (complete cure) after 12-months."

MATERIAL AND METHODS Eighty patients who underwent elective laparoscopic gynecological surgery were selected and randomly allocated to the control and buccal acupuncture groups, with 40 patients in each group. Hemodynamic indices and dosages of propofol, remifentanil, sufentanil, and vasoactive drugs used during the surgery were recorded. We collected the Ramsay sedation score (RSS) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores of the patients at T4. Magnetic-sensitive immunoassay kits were used to measure plasma IL-6, SAA, CRP, and PCT concentrations in the venous blood at T0, T3, and T5. RESULTS The average dosage of sufentanil in the control group was significantly higher than that in the buccal acupuncture group (P<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in the dosages of remifentanil and propofol or in the usage rates of urapidil, phenylephrine, atropine, and metoprolol between the 2 groups (all P>0.05). Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences in SBP, DBP, HR, and MAP at T0-T5 (all P>0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in IL-6, SAA, CRP, or PCT levels at T0, T3, or T5 (all P>0.05). At T4, the RSS and VAS pain scores were similar (all P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS Buccal acupuncture therapy for laparoscopic gynecological surgery can reduce the dosage of sufentanil and does not aggravate fluctuations in hemodynamic indices, inflammatory responses, or the incidence of adverse reactions. This has practical clinical significance in reducing the burden on patients.",

METHODS: A computerized search of articles on acupuncture treatment of central facial palsy was conducted from databases of China National Knowledge Infrastructure(CNKI), Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform (Wanfang), VIP Information Chinese Journal Service Platform (VIP) , China Biomedical Literature Database(CBM), Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science from their inception to September 25th, 2023. The Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias of all the included literature, and Meta-analysis on the extracted data was conducted using Review Manager 5.4 software. RESULTS: Eleven studies with a total of 893 patients were finally included, and the bias risks of the included studies were all \"some concerns\". The results of Meta-analysis suggested that:1) the observation group was superior to the control group in improving the the House-Brackmann facial nerve grading system (H-B) scores (MD=6.41, 95%CI [3.69, 9.14], Z=4.62, P<0.000 01), facial disability index (FDI) scores (somatic function) (MD=2.72, 95%CI [0.31, 5.12], Z=2.21, P=0.03), and clinical effective rate (RR=1.25, 95%CI [1.15, 1.35], Z=5.57, P<0.000 01);2) the observation group was not significantly different from the control group in improving the Toronto facial nerve assessment system (TFGS) scores (MD=3.66, 95%CI [ -2.33, 9.65], Z=1.20, P=0.23), the degrees of facial nerve paralysis (DFNP) scores (MD=4.60, 95%CI [ -1.14, 10.34], Z=1.57, P=0.12), FDI scores (social function) (MD=3.00, 95%CI [ -0.67, 6.66], Z=1.60, P=0.11). CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture therapy has advantages in clinical efficacy and safety than conventional drugs and other sports rehabilitation therapies in improving post-stroke central facial palsy.

METHODS: Fifty-four male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into sham operation, model and acupuncture groups, with 18 mice in each group. The ICH model was established by injection of the mouse's auto-blood (10 μL) into the right caudate nucleus. Mice of the acupuncture group received acupuncture at \"Baihui\" (GV20) for 30 min, twice daily for 7 days. The neurological functions (locomotor and balance deficits) were evaluated according to wire hanging test (0-5 points) and balance walking test (0-5 points) before modeling and after treatment. Histopathological changes in the brain were observed by HE staining. RNA-sequencing and m6A- sequencing were used to analyze the differential m6A modification genes. Immunofluorescence and Western blot were used to detect the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) and sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) proteins in brain tissue, respectively. RESULTS: HE staining showed that in the brain tissue nucleus was pyknotic, inflammatory cells were infiltrated, neurons were edematous and necrotic in the model group, which were relatively milder in the acupuncture group. The sequencing results showed that 592 differentially expressed genes were screened in the model group vs sham operation group, and 849 differentially expressed genes were screened in the acupuncture group vs model group. Five genes that inhibit ferroptosis were obtained by intersecting with genes that inhibit ferroptosis, namely charged multi vesicular body protein (Chmp) 1a, Chmp6, glutaredoxin (Glrx) 5, Gpx4, and Sirt3. Compared with the sham operation group, the wire hanging test and balance walking test scores, gene expression levels of Chmp1a, Chmp6, Glrx5, Gpx4, and Sirt3, Gpx4/NeuN and Sirt3/NeuN co-expressed fluorescence intensity, the protein expressions of Gpx4 and Sirt3 in brain tissue were all significantly decreased in the model group (P<0.01). Following the interventions, the wire hanging test and balance walking test scores, gene expression levels of Chmp1a, Chmp6, Glrx5, Gpx4, and Sirt3, Gpx4/NeuN and Sirt3/NeuN co-expressed fluorescence intensity, the protein expressions of Gpx4 and Sirt3 in brain tissue were all significantly increased in the acupuncture group compared with the model group (P<0.01, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture can ameliorate neurological deficits, which may be associated with its function in improving m6A RNA modification and RNA expression in mice with ICH, and promoting the expression of ferroptosis antioxidation related proteins Gpx4 and Sirt3 in brain tissue.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Procedural pain management in newborns, particularly those in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), presents challenges due to limited safe and effective options. Acupuncture, a Traditional Chinese Medicine practice, has emerged as a potential alternative for pain relief in this population. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of acupuncture in newborn infants undergoing painful procedures. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, and clinical trial registries up to August 2023. We checked the references of included studies and related systematic reviews. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included parallel and cross-over randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with no treatment or sham treatment; any non-pharmacological treatment; any pharmacological treatment; or one type of acupuncture compared to another type of acupuncture. OUTCOMES: Our outcomes were: pain scores; harms; parental, family, and caregiver satisfaction with the intervention; use of additional pharmacological intervention for pain relief; episodes of bradycardia/apnea/desaturation; neonatal mortality; mortality during initial hospitalization; intraventricular hemorrhage; late-onset sepsis; duration of hospital stay; major neurodevelopmental disability. RISK OF BIAS: We used Cochrane's RoB 1 tool for RCTs. SYNTHESIS METHODS: We conducted meta-analyses using fixed-effect models to calculate risk ratios (RR) and risk differences (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD, when combining different pain scales) and standard deviation for continuous outcomes. We summarized the certainty of evidence according to the GRADE approach. INCLUDED STUDIES: We included 11 RCTs enrolling 852 infants. Five studies compared acupuncture to no treatment or sham treatment; four studies to non-pharmacological treatment (oral sucrose or glucose); and two studies compared acupuncture to other types of Traditional Chinese Medicine treatments, which we refer to as 'type B acupuncture,' such as foot massage or reflexology. No studies compared acupuncture to any pharmacological treatment. We identified four ongoing studies. SYNTHESIS OF RESULTS: We have listed outcomes reported in at least one study. Acupuncture compared to no treatment or sham treatment Acupuncture may reduce pain assessed during the procedure with any validated scale compared to no intervention (SMD -0.56, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.37; 7 studies, 471 infants; low-certainty evidence). It may result in little to no difference in any harms compared to no intervention (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.31; 2 studies, 138 infants; low-certainty evidence). Acupuncture compared to any non-pharmacological treatment The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of acupuncture on pain assessed with a validated scale during the procedure compared to non-pharmacological intervention (SMD 0.29, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.54; 4 studies, 267 infants; very low-certainty evidence). Acupuncture may result in little to no difference in any harms compared to non-pharmacological treatment (RR not estimable, RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.03; 3 studies, 247 infants; low-certainty evidence). Acupuncture type A (e.g. penetration of the skin with a needle) compared to acupuncture type B (e.g. foot massage or reflexology) The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of acupressure on pain assessed with any validated scale during the procedure compared to foot massage (SMD 0.05, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.36; 2 studies, 163 infants; very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture may reduce pain assessed with different scales during the procedure, with little to no difference in any harms, when compared to no intervention. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of acupuncture on pain assessed with different scales during the procedure when compared to any non-pharmacological treatment; acupuncture may result in little to no difference in any harms. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of acupressure on pain assessed during the procedure when compared to foot massage or reflexology.

The SA group received scalp acupuncture treatment for 4 weeks, the iTBS group underwent intermittent theta burst stimulation for 4 weeks, and the combined group received both scalp acupuncture and iTBS treatments for 4 weeks. All enrolled patients also received standard pharmacological and conventional rehabilitation treatments, six days a week, for four weeks in total. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) before treatment (baseline) and after treatment (4 weeks). Additionally, changes in cerebral hemodynamics during the experiment were measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).ResultsScalp acupuncture therapy, iTBS therapy, and the combination of scalp acupuncture with iTBS therapy all significantly activated the cortical regions of the frontal and temporal lobes in patients with Post-Stroke Cognitive Impairment No Dementia (PSCIND) (P < 0.05). Compared to scalp acupuncture or iTBS therapy alone, the combined therapy activated more channels, with more significant activation in the right Superior Temporal Cortex (r-STC), right Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex (r-VLPFC), Medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC), left Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex (l-VLPFC), right Superior Frontal Cortex (r-SFC), and left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (l-DLPFC) (P < 0.05). The combined therapy enhances cognitive functions in PSCIND patients, exhibiting superior clinical effectiveness compared to either scalp acupuncture or iTBS therapy when used individually (P < 0.05).ConclusionThe combination of scalp acupuncture with iTBS therapy represents a novel and promising neurorehabilitation treatment technique for post-stroke cognitive impairment. Future clinical research is needed to explore its therapeutic mechanisms and further refine this technique.",

METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 1:1 matching design. A total of 96 cases of mild to moderate PSD patients were enrolled and divided into 48 cases each in the control group and the observation group. The control group received treatment with Escitalopram oxalate tablets. The observation group received acupuncture combined with Escitalopram Oxalate, both for a duration of 8 weeks. Comparisons were performed in regard clinical efficacy, 17-Item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Barthel Index, neurotransmitters (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT], norepinephrine [NE], and dopamine [DA]), and liver function (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], direct bilirubin [DBIL], and total bilirubin [TBIL]). The Side Effect Rating Scale (SERS) scores at weekends 4 and 8 of treatment were counted. RESULTS: The total effective rate was 91.67% (44/48) higher for the observation group than 75.00% (36/48) for the control group (P < 0.05). HAMD-17, NIHSS, and PSQI scores decreased in the two groups after treatment, and they were all lower in the observation group than in the control group (P < 0.05). The observation group had a higher Barthel index than the control group (P < 0.05). Serum 5-HT, NE and DA levels increased in both groups after treatment, and serum markers were higher in the observation group compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The differences in SERS scores between the two groups were not significant (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Combining acupuncture with Escitalopram oxalate proves to be effective and safe for treating mild-to-moderate PSD, significantly alleviating depression, and enhancing neurological function, sleep quality, and quality of life."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The incidence of acute ischemic stroke has been rising steadily in China and globally, with its high mortality and disability rates significantly affecting quality of life. As an important adjunct therapy, acupuncture has been widely implemented in stroke management. Emerging studies have investigated the effects of DU meridian and Chong Mai acupuncture on ischemic hemiparesis; however, the vascular protective mechanisms of electroacupuncture therapy targeting these meridians require further elucidation in stroke rehabilitation research. OBJECTIVE: This prospective cohort study aims to investigate the clinical efficacy and limitations of DU meridian acupuncture combined with Temporal Triple Needling (Sanjian) therapy in stroke rehabilitation. The intervention's therapeutic potential is evaluated through its modulatory effects on CD14+/CD14- monocyte subpopulations within peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), with particular focus on angiogenesis-mediated vascular protection mechanisms. METHODS: Sixty-six patients with acute ischemic stroke will be randomly assigned 1:1 to control (conventional basal therapy, n = 33) and acupuncture (conventional standard stroke care + acupuncture, n = 33) groups for 10 days of intervention. The primary outcome is NIHSS score. The secondary outcomes: BMI and mRS scores, the level of TNF-A and IL-1B in serum, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Endocan ES, CD14+ and CD14- levels of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. DISCUSSION: The aim of this study is to investigate whether electroacupuncture targeting the DU meridian combined with Temporal Triple Needling (Sanjian) improves cerebrovascular endothelial function in acute ischemic stroke patients, thereby reducing the NIHSS score and preventing further disease progression. This study also aims to contribute positively to the development of relevant clinical treatment protocols and to facilitate further research into the underlying mechanisms of these effects.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The clinical application of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is significantly constrained by hemorrhagic transformation (HT), a common and severe complication following thrombolysis for ischemic stroke. Notably, the mitochondrial injury-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome plays a crucial role in HT after delayed rt-PA thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke. Although acupuncture has demonstrated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in acute cerebral infarction, its impact on delayed rt-PA thrombolysis, especially concerning mitophagy and the NLRP3 inflammasome, remains unclear. This study investigates how acupuncture protects against HT resulting from mitochondrial damage and NLRP3 inflammasome activation after delayed rt-PA thrombolysis in acute cerebral stroke. METHODS: We selected an embolic stroke model in rats and assessed brain injury after delayed rt-PA in acute ischemic stroke using neurological deficit score, volume of brain infarct, the permeability assay of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and HT. Then, the levels of proteins and mRNA involved in mitophagy and the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway were measured by western blot and real-time PCR. The levels of interleukin-18 (IL-18) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Morphological changes in the BBB and mitochondria of neurons were observed via transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Acupuncture significantly improved neurological deficit scores, volume of cerebral infarction, BBB destruction, and HT in an embolic stroke model rat. Furthermore, acupuncture induced mitophagy and substantially downregulated the activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Additionally, the use of mitochondrial inhibitors significantly reversed the suppressive impact of acupuncture on the NLRP3 inflammasome. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture can promote mitophagy and suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activation to decrease HT after delayed rt-PA therapy for acute ischemic stroke."

METHODS: We searched the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang (WF), Weipu (VIP), China Biology Medicine, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Clinical Trials electronic databases from database inception to January 2024 to identify randomized controlled trials that examined the use of acupuncture to treat PDCI. Studies published in Chinese or English were considered eligible. Two independent reviewers performed the literature search. Data extracted from the included studies were analyzed via RevMan 5.4 software for Meta. The mean effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: This meta-analysis ultimately included 9 articles involving a total of 629 patients. The outcome measures included the mini-mental state examination, the montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), and the overall effective rate. The meta-analysis revealed that there were significant differences in all 3 outcomes between the experimental and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture can be used as an effective treatment for PDCI and is significantly superior to conventional treatments. However, considering the low methodological quality of the included studies, results of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution. In addition, due to the inconsistency observed in this study, more clinical trials are needed for further investigation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In recent years, research on acupuncture for post-stroke depression (PSD) has grown significantly, yet findings remain inconsistent. Few researchers have conducted comprehensive assessments of systematic reviews (SRs) in this area. Consequently, there is a need for a thorough and objective synthesis of clinical evidence regarding acupuncture's effectiveness in treating PSD. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and synthesize evidence on the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for PSD through systematic reviews, offering valuable insights for clinical practice and guiding future research directions. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CNKI, SinoMed, Wanfang, VIP and Google Scholar databases for relevant literature. The search covered publications from database inception to September 10, 2024. Literature selection and data extraction were independently performed by two reviewers. The methodological quality, bias risk, and evidence level of included SRs were assessed using AMSTAR 2, ROBIS, and GRADE tools. The corrected covered area (CCA) was calculated to assess overlap in original studies. Data from included SRs were subjected to quantitative or descriptive analysis. RESULTS: A total of 38 SRs on acupuncture for PSD were included. After assessment using AMSTAR 2, one SR was rated as moderate quality, two as low quality, and 35 as very low quality. According to ROBIS, 21 SRs were classified as high risk of overall bias, and 17 as low risk. Acupuncture showed potential to improve depressive symptoms, stroke-related symptoms, and activities of daily living in PSD patients, though the quality of evidence is limited. Some studies suggested possible effects on cognitive function, biomarkers, sleep quality, and Traditional Chinese Medicine syndromes, but these findings require further validation with higher-quality research. While no serious adverse effects were reported in the reviewed studies, more rigorous safety evaluations are needed before definitive conclusions about acupuncture's safety for PSD can be made. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture shows potential as a treatment for PSD, though more high-quality research is needed to establish its effectiveness and safety. Currently, the majority of systematic reviews exhibit deficiencies in protocol pre-registration, documentation of excluded studies, and disclosure of funding sources, resulting in systematic reviews of suboptimal quality. Current evidence suggests possible benefits for depressive symptoms, stroke-related symptoms, activities of daily living, cognitive function, biomarkers, sleep quality, and TCM syndromes, but these findings should be interpreted cautiously given the limitations in study quality. Further high-quality studies are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for PSD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acupuncture and moxibustion, as traditional therapies in Chinese medicine, are widely recognized for their therapeutic effects, particularly in pain relief. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms underlying their analgesic effects remain to be fully elucidated. Advancements in neuroimaging techniques have opened a novel pathway for investigating alterations in brain function resulting from acupuncture and moxibustion analgesia. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the brain regions activated during acupuncture and moxibustion treatment for pathological pain using neuroimaging, to better understand the underlying analgesic mechanisms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An electronic search of PubMed was conducted using the keywords \"acupuncture\", \"moxibustion\", \"analgesia\", and \"neuroimaging\". A total of 37 articles, focusing on 14 diseases, were identified and analyzed. RESULTS: Acupuncture primarily activated regions in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, with key areas including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, prefrontal cortex (PFC), and primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Different stimulation modes and disease types produced distinct patterns of brain region activation. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture and moxibustion modulate key brain regions involved in pain perception, emotional regulation, and cognitive functions. Acupuncture predominantly affects the sensory cortex, enhancing pain perception, while moxibustion has a more pronounced effect on the limbic system and thalamus, influencing emotional and cognitive aspects of pain. The findings indicate that acupuncture and moxibustion serve as effective non-pharmacological therapies for pain management, offering valuable insights into their underlying analgesic mechanisms. Future research should focus on further elucidating these mechanisms and optimizing clinical applications."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Emotional symptomatology is a hallmark of depression. Antidepressant often fail to effectively target emotional blunting, while acupuncture, by contrast, has emerged as a promising alternative. However, the exact electrophysiologic mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate how acupuncture influences emotional reactivity in youth with self-reported depressive symptoms. METHODS: A modified oddball paradigm incorporating a negative emotional valence deviant, combined with event-related potential analysis, was used to measure emotional reactivity before and after intervention. Seventy individuals exhibiting depressive symptoms in the previous 2 weeks, were randomly assigned to either a verum or sham acupuncture group. Electroencephalogram data from 59 participants were analyzed following preprocessing and quality assessment. Occipital P1, N170, frontal N1, N2, and parietal P3 components were extracted. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) was completed after each oddball session. The Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS) was completed after each intervention session. RESULTS: The MASS Index was significantly higher in the verum group. However, significant increases in occipital P1, N170, frontal N1, N2, and parietal P3 amplitudes for high-negative, mild-negative, and neutral pictures were observed after the intervention in both the verum and sham groups, with no significant difference between the groups. Additionally, both groups induced PANAS changes, and positive effect changes were significantly correlated with N170 and P1 (in response to high-negative pictures) changes in the sham group. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture altered emotional reactivity in youth with depressive symptoms, highlighting its potential role, albeit possibly non-specific, in depression prevention and treatment."

Therefore, the aim of this research is to evaluate the effects of low-level laser therapy at acupuncture points on pain mechanisms caused by orthodontic separators. For the study, 162 healthy adult volunteers over the age of 18 were selected. Orthodontic separators were installed to stimulate pain. The volunteers were divided into three groups: Group 1 received diode laser (808 nm, 100 mW) at acupuncture points for 40 s (4 J energy), Group 2 received diode laser (808 nm, 100 mW) on molars with orthodontic separators for 40 s (4 J energy), and Group 3 received a placebo at acupuncture points. The acupuncture points used were: LI4 (Hegu), EX2 (Yintang), LI6 (Pianli), LI11 (Quchi), and LU7 (Lieque). A modified Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to assess pain levels. To evaluate differences in pain intensity between groups and over time, the Friedman and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used. Statistical analysis confirmed a significant difference in pain intensity between groups over time (p < 0.001). No significant difference in pain perception was observed between genders (p = 0.943). The difference between the groups that received laser therapy at acupuncture points and local points was not statistically significant (p = 0.272). It can be concluded that laser therapy at acupuncture points yields results similar to laser therapy for pain induced by the installation of orthodontic separators, with both being more effective than placebo treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Shoulder-hand syndrome (SHS) is one of the common sequelae after stroke, which not only hinders the recovery of patients, but also increases the economic burden of the family. In the absence of effective treatment measures, acupuncture treatment has been widely used in China to treat post-stroke shoulder-hand syndrome, but the details are unclear. Therefore, this review aims to evaluate the true efficacy of acupuncture in patients with SHS. METHODS: We searched eight databases [PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane library, China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China Science and Technology Journal (VIP) database, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, and Wan fang database] from its inception to March 2025, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of SHS acupuncture treatment combined with rehabilitation (Rehab). Two investigators independently used pre-designed forms to extract valid data from eligible randomized controlled trials. Meta-analysis was implemented through the Rev. Man software (version 5.4). The strength of the evidence obtained was implemented using the GRADE profiler software. Adverse events (AEs) were collected by reading the full text and used to evaluate the safety of acupuncture treatment. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies, involving 4,129 participants, met the eligibility criteria, and were included in the review. Overall meta-analysis showed that combined acupuncture rehabilitation significantly improved motor function (upper-limb Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA): 41 studies, mean difference (MD) 9.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) [8.47, 10.53]) and pain reduction (visual analog score (VAS): 37 studies, MD: -1.49, 95% CI [-1.66, -1.33]). It also improved activities of daily living (ADL) compared to rehabilitation alone (ADL: 17 studies, MD: 11.94, 95% CI [8.26, 13.63]). There was no significant difference in the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) between acupuncture treatment combined with Rehab and Rehab alone (p > 0.05). The certainty of the evidence was rated low level because of flaws in the study design and considerable heterogeneity among the included studies. CONCLUSION: This review found that acupuncture treatment combined with Rehab treatment may have a positive promoting effect on improving motor function, reducing pain, and improving daily living ability in SHS patients. However, due to the existing methodological quality issues, our findings should be treated with caution. Future high-quality studies are urgently needed to validate our findings.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese exercises (TCEs), as a new technology for pulmonary rehabilitation, have been proven to be effective in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, further aggravation of dynamic hyperinflation manifested as exertional dyspnea during exercises may limit the partial therapeutic efficacy of TCEs on patients with COPD. Acupuncture therapy, internationally recognized as a complementary and alternative therapy, can effectively improve the degree of dyspnea, and it is expected to serve as an adjuvant therapy for exercise training in patients with COPD to fully realize the therapeutic efficacy of exercise training. Therefore, this study aims to explore the multidimensional and multi-system effects of the combination of pulmonary-based Qigong (PQ) exercise and acupuncture therapy on patients with COPD. METHODS: This protocol describes an assessor-blinded, data analyst-blinded, four-arm randomized controlled trial that aims to recruit 132 participants with stable COPD and randomly allocate them into pulmonary-based Qigong exercise group, acupuncture group, pulmonary-based Qigong exercise and acupuncture combined group, or control group at a 1:1:1:1 ratio. All participants will receive usual medical care and health education; those in the intervention groups will receive PQ exercise, acupuncture treatment, or a combination of both treatments three times per week for 8 weeks. The primary outcome will be the exercise endurance as assessed by a 6-min walk test. Secondary outcomes will include lung function, degree of dyspnea, diaphragmatic function, respiratory muscle strength, skeletal muscle structure, skeletal muscle function, psychological states, and quality of life. Exploratory outcomes will include the levels of inflammatory mediators. The frequency and severity of acute exacerbations of COPD will be recorded at baseline and 1 year after intervention. DISCUSSION: The findings of this study will clarify the effects of the combination of PQ exercise and acupuncture therapy on the multi-system function of patients with stable COPD to provide evidence for acupuncture as an adjuvant therapy for pulmonary rehabilitation.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Supportive and palliative care include non-oncology settings where patients suffer from pain and quality of life-related concerns. Integrative medicine plays important roles in supportive care and symptom management, including Integrative Obstetric (IOb) programmes within peri-partum settings. Multidisciplinary approaches may help nurse-midwives and obstetricians improve patient care and associated outcomes. This study presents a national perspective on IOb programmes in Israel. METHODS: A qualitative research methodology was codesigned by the Society for Complementary Medicine and Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Israel Medical Association. A questionnaire with 17 open-ended questions was distributed throughout obstetrics and gynaecology departments across Israel. Respondent narratives were qualitatively analysed using ATLAS.Ti software for systematic coding. RESULTS: 22 senior obstetricians and IOb directors across 11 centres with IOb programmes completed the questionnaire. Core themes considered essential for the design and operation of IOb programmes included (1) determining major goals and indications for referral, primarily pain and anxiety; (2) targeting patients most likely to benefit; (3) identifying barriers and enablers to implementation and communication with the obstetric team; (4) designing the referral process and (5) documenting outcomes and safety of the IOb intervention in electronic medical files. CONCLUSIONS: Designing and implementing IOb models of care that effectively support holistic symptom management within obstetric settings requires identifying barriers and enablers and establishing effective communication between obstetric and integrative medical teams. Further research should explore other multidisciplinary models of IOb care and structured referral development and testing while assessing risks and effectiveness."

Acupuncture has shown potential in managing these symptoms but remains less accessible for medically underserved populations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the acceptability, challenges, and facilitators of acupuncture integration from the perspective of health system partners. INTERVENTIONS/METHODS: Using a convergent mixed-methods approach and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we conducted interviews (n = 14) and surveys (n = 13) with administrators, providers, and staff from a federally qualified health center and oncology clinic between September 2023 and May 2024. Interviews were analyzed through directed content analysis, and descriptive statistics assessed demographics and acupuncture experience, as well as 6 key Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research constructs. RESULTS: Five key themes emerged: acceptability and willingness to use acupuncture, limited experience and awareness of its effectiveness, and perceived challenges and facilitators to implementation. Survey results highlighted a positive organizational culture, strong leadership engagement, and a supportive learning environment, although clinic stress was noted as a concern. High receptivity to acupuncture was evident, with challenges (eg, limited insurance coverage) and facilitators (eg, leadership support and collaboration with community partners) identified for its integration. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong support among administrators, providers, and staff for integrating acupuncture into care for underserved breast cancer survivors. Addressing challenges while leveraging facilitators will aid successful implementation. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Enhancing patient/provider education, establishing acupuncture spaces, fostering supportive clinic environments, securing funding, and addressing insurance coverage issues are vital steps to advancing equitable access to acupuncture."

This study systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed acupuncture's effects on migraine prophylaxis compared to standard medical care, focusing on study heterogeneity and issues related to sham interventions. METHODS: Following the PRISMA guidelines and using the PICO model, the study searched PubMed, Scopus, CNKI, and VIP database from December 1965 to September 2024. Studies evaluating acupuncture's clinical efficacy for migraine prophylaxis, including clinical trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports, were considered. An additional search was conducted on the clinicaltrials.gov database from the beginning of indexing up to September 2024 to include ongoing studies. Quality control and bias assessment were performed. Primary outcomes focused on acupuncture's efficacy and safety versus pharmacological treatments in reducing migraine frequency and intensity. The impact on patients' quality of life was also evaluated. RESULTS: At the end of the selection process, 15 studies were eligible. Acupuncture showed no statistically significant difference as a prophylactic treatment for migraine in reducing the frequency of migraine days or pain intensity but did reduce the use of analgesics while improving patients' quality of life. CONCLUSION: Current evidence supports acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy in migraine prophylaxis, but challenges such as protocol heterogeneity, dropout biases, the complexities of sham-controlled trials, and the lack of comparison data with newer innovative treatments not yet considered warrant further research.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the effect of acupuncture combined with Western medicine on vertebrobasilar artery hemodynamics and its clinical efficacy in patients with cervical vertigo. To provide a reliable evidence-based medical basis for the clinical treatment of CV. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis will be reported in agreement with the Meta-Analyses (PRISMA2020) statement. MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, Wan Fang, and China Biology Medicine Disc (CBM) were searched until August 20, 2024. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias, and the data were analyzed using Revman5.4, StataMP 18, and TSA0.9.5.10Beta software. RESULTS: A total of 7 randomized controlled trials involving 714 patients were included. The meta-analysis results showed that acupuncture combined with Western medication was superior to simple Western medication in improving the blood flow velocity of the left vertebral artery, right vertebral artery, and basilar artery in patients with CV, improving the symptoms of cervical vertigo and improving its function and clinical efficacy. TSA analysis results again confirmed the robustness of the results of this meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture combined with Western medicine has measurable benefits in improving vertebrobasilar hemodynamics and clinical efficacy in patients with CV, with certain safety. However, there are still methodological defects such as small sample size, different acupuncture treatment methods, and information on minimal clinically relevant differences is missing. In the future, RCTs with larger sample sizes and longer observations are still needed to further verify the efficacy of acupuncture combined with Western medicine, and an updated meta-analysis can be conducted to analyze the efficacy of acupuncture combined with Western medicine in the treatment of CV.

He proposes the treatment model of \"regulating viscera, unblocking ocular collaterals, and opening mysterious orifices\" based on yuan-primary and luo-connecting meridian-regulating acupuncture. Yuan-primary and luo-connecting points are used to balance qi, blood, yin, and yang of the viscera. Baihui (GV20) is stimulated with transcranial repetitive acupuncture to activate the yang qi of the governor vessel and invigorate qi in the twelve meridians, improving systemic microcirculation. Combining this with stimulation of ocular areas, Fengchi (GB20), and periocular points, the stasis in the ocular collaterals are cleared and the mysterious orifices are unblocked, addressing both the root and manifestations of DR.",

In pathogenesis, post-stroke depression is associated with the loss of the mind control and the failure of the liver in maintaining the free flow of qi. In treating principle, soothing the liver qi and regulating the mind are equally important, and the holistic regulation is applicable with the combination of multiple therapies. During treatment, the four-gate points are stimulated at first to promote liver qi flowing, the acupoints of the conception vessel and the governor vessel (e.g. Zhongwan [CV12], Guanyuan [CV4], Baihui [GV20], Yintang [GV24+]) are combined to regulate the mind and regain the consciousness. The conditions of illness are differentiated in terms of excess and deficiency, and the point prescription is modified accordingly. Refined moxibustion is applied specially at Fengchi (GB20), Fengfu (GV16) and Wangu (GB12) to warm meridians, strengthen yang and nourish the mind. In the last step of treatment, shallow needling techniques, such as the pricking and bloodletting, intradermal needling and auricular acupuncture, are used to consolidate the curative effect.",

METHODS: Of 70 female C57BL/6 mice, 60 mice with regular estrous cycle were screened and 30 of them were randomly divided into a blank group, a model group, and an acupuncture group, 10 mice in each one. Mice in the model and acupuncture groups were administered with tripterygium glycosides suspension (50 mg·kg-1·d-1) via gavage for 2 weeks to prepare POR models; while in the blank group, the mice received an equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride solution via gavage. After successful modeling, mice in the acupuncture group underwent \"Zhibian\" (BL54)-to-\"Shuidao\" (ST28) needling technique, once daily, for 20 min each time and lasting 2 consecutive weeks. After intervention completion, subsequently, all the three groups underwent ovulation induction, orbital blood collection, and ovary extraction and fresh denuded oocyte collection. Denuded oocytes, after incubated, together with the sperms from 15 male C57BL/6 mice, were transferred into the oviducts of 30 donor pseudopregnant C57BL/6 female mice via IVF-ET; and the embryonic tissue was collected on day 7 of implantation. After successful modeling and intervention completion, the general conditions of mice in each group were observed, and the estrous cycle disorder rate was compared among the groups. After intervention completion, the numbers of oocyte, ovarian wet weight and ovarian index were recorded in each group; the levels of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol (E2) in the serum were measured using ELISA; and ovarian morphology and mitochondrial ultrastructure were examined using HE staining and transmission electron microscopy. The transcriptome sequencing technology was employed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in early embryos of each group, followed by bioinformatics analysis; and the reversed DEGs with significant difference were verified using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: After intervention, compared with the blank group, the mice in the model group presented poor spirits and declined water and food intake, reduced activity, the higher rate of estrous cycle disorder (P< 0.01); the decrease of the numbers of oocyte, ovarian wet weight, and ovarian index (P<0.01), reduced AMH and E2 in the serum (P<0.01), elevated FSH and LH in the serum (P<0.01); more atresia follicles in ovarian tissue, disorganized granulosa cells, reduced the numbers of mitochondria, vacuoles appeared and cristae breakage. When compared with the model group, in the acupuncture group, the spirits of mice, food intake and activity were improved, the rate of estrous cycle disorder was reduced (P<0.01); the numbers of oocyte, ovarian wet weight, and ovarian index were higher (P<0.01, P<0.05), the levels of AMH and E2 in the serum increased (P<0.01), the levels of FSH and LH in the serum decreased (P<0.01); the atresia follicles were reduced, the numbers of follicle increased at all levels, the numbers of mitochondria got higher, vacuoles and cristae breakage were declined. In comparison between the blank group and the model group, and between the model group and the acupuncture group, a total of 258 intersecting DEGs were identified, and 194 DEGs of them exhibited a trend of reversion before and after intervention. The top 5 reversed DEGs with significant difference included dexamethasone-induced Ras-related protein 1 (Rasd1), gene regulated by estrogen in breast cancer 1 (Greb1), leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 6 (Lgr6), Fraser syndrome 1 (Fras1), and apolipoprotein D (Apod). Compared with the blank group, the mRNA expression of Rasd1, Greb1, Lgr6, Fras1 and Apod in embryonic tissues decreased in the model group (P<0.01, P<0.05); and when compared with the model group, the mRNA expression of Rasd1, Greb1, Lgr6, Fras1 and Apod in embryonic tissues increased in the acupuncture group (P<0.05, P<0.01). These findings were consistent with the DEGs screening results. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the reversed genes of co-expression were primarily participated in the biological processes such as myoblast differentiation, endocardial cushion development, and cardiac morphogenesis. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that the reversed genes of co-expression are enriched in the Wnt signaling pathway, and they were associated with various types of cardiac diseases. CONCLUSION: The \"Zhibian\" (BL54)-to-\"Shuidao\" (ST28) needling technique may ameliorate the decline of ovarian response in mice with POR, promote normal follicle development and ovulation, thereby improve embryo quality and reduce the risk of developmental defects and deformity in the organs such as the embryonic heart. The underlying mechanism may be related to the regulation of the expression pattern of embryonic key genes through the Wnt signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy differences among different acupuncture frequencies for pain of temporomandibular disorders (TMD). METHODS: A total of 42 patients with TMD pain were randomly divided into a low-frequency group, a medium-frequency group, and a high-frequency group, with 14 patients in each group. All groups received acupuncture treatment at bilateral Hegu (LI4) and Yanglingquan (GB34), as well as ipsilateral Tinggong (SI19), Jiache (ST6), and Xiaguan (ST7), with each session lasting 30 minutes. The low-frequency group received acupuncture once per week, the medium-frequency group received acupuncture twice per week, and the high-frequency group received acupuncture three times per week, for a total duration of four weeks. The graded chronic pain scale (GCPS) score, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, jaw functional limitation scale-20 (JFLS-20) score, and pressure pain threshold (PPT) were assessed in the three groups before and after treatment, as well as at the four-week follow-up after treatment completion. RESULTS: Compared before treatment, GCPS and JFLS-20 scores were significantly decreased in all the groups after treatment (P<0.05), and VAS scores were significantly decreased in the high-frequency and medium-frequency groups (P<0.05), PPT values at different measurement sites were increased significantly in the high-frequency group (P<0.05). After treatment, GCPS, JFLS-20, and VAS scores in the high-frequency group were lower than those in the medium-frequency and low-frequency groups (P<0.05), while some PPT values were higher than the other two groups (P<0.05). At follow-up, GCPS, JFLS-20, and VAS scores remained significantly lower in all the groups compared to baseline (P<0.05), PPT values were increased significantly in the high-frequency and medium-frequency groups (P<0.05), with the high-frequency group showing lower GCPS, JFLS-20, and VAS scores and higher PPT values compared to the other two groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture three times per week is more effective in reducing TMD pain intensity compared to once or twice per week, and can also alleviate some mandibular functional impairments. The therapeutic effects persist for at least four weeks after treatment completion.",

METHODS: A total of 92 PSD patients were randomly assigned to an observation group (46 cases, 1 case was discontinued) and a control group (46 cases, 1 case was discontinued, 1 case dropped out). The patients in the control group received rehabilitation training, including low-frequency neuromuscular electrical stimulation for swallowing, lip and tongue movement training, and oral sensory function training, once daily, five times per week, for four weeks. The patients in the observation group received the Tongnao Huoluo Liyan acupuncture method in addition to the same rehabilitation training. Acupoints included Lianquan (CV23), bilateral Jia Lianquan, Jinjin (EX-HN12), Yuye (EX-HN13), Baihui (GV20), Shuigou (GV26), and bilateral Neiguan (PC6), once daily, five times per week, for four weeks. Before and after treatment, Kubota water stvallowing test grading, standardized swallowing assessment (SSA) scores, Fujishima Ichiro swallowing efficacy scores, and swallowing quality of life questionnaire (SWAL-QOL) scores were assessed in both groups. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was used to evaluate the average amplitude (AEMG) and mean swallowing time of the suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscle groups. RESULTS: After treatment, the proportion of patients classified as Grade Ⅰ or Ⅱ in the Kubota water stvallowing test was increased in both groups (P<0.05), with better results in the observation group compared to the control group (P<0.05). Compare before treatment, SSA scores were decreased in both groups after treatment (P<0.05), with lower scores in the observation group than in the control group (P<0.05). Compare before treatment, Fujishima Ichiro swallowing efficacy scores and SWAL-QOL scores were improved in both groups after treatment (P<0.05), with significantly higher scores in the observation group than those in the control group (P<0.05). Compare before treatment, AEMG values of the Submental musckes and infrahyoid muscles groups were increased (P<0.05), and mean swallowing time was decreased (P<0.05) in both groups after treatment. The observation group showed greater increases in AEMG values and shorter mean swallowing times compared to the control group (P<0.05). The total effective rate was 97.8% (44/45) in the observation group, higher than 84.1% (37/44) in the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The Tongnao Huoluo Liyan acupuncture combined with rehabilitation training could enhance the contraction function in swallowing-related muscle groups, facilitate hyoid and laryngeal elevation, restore swallowing function, and improve patients' quality of life. This combined treatment approach is superior to rehabilitation training alone.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To screen the population for acupuncture treatment of neck pain, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology and based on machine learning algorithms. METHODS: Eighty patients with neck pain were recruited. Using FPX25 handheld pressure algometer, the tender points were detected in the areas with high-frequent onset of neck pain and high degree of acupoint sensitization. Acupuncture was delivered at 4 tender points with the lowest pain threshold, once every two days; and the treatment was given 3 times a week and for 2 consecutive weeks. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of the brain before treatment was taken as a predictive feature to construct support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) models to predict the responses of neck pain patients to acupuncture treatment. A longitudinal analysis of the ALFF features was performed before and after treatment to reveal the potential biological markers of the reactivity to the acupuncture therapy. RESULTS: The SVM model could successfully distinguish high responders (48 cases) and low responders (32 cases) to acupuncture treatment, and its accuracy rate reached 82.5%. Based on the SVM model, the ALFF values of 4 brain regions were identified as the consistent predictive features, including the right middle temporal gyrus, the right superior occipital gyrus, and the bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus. In the patients with high acupuncture response, the ALFF value in the left posterior cingulate gyrus decreased after treatment (P<0.05), whereas in the patients with low acupuncture response, the ALFF value in the right superior occipital gyrus increased after treatment (P<0.01). The longitudinal functional connectivity (FC) analysis found that compared with those before treatment, the high responders showed the enhanced FC after treatment between the left posterior cingulate gyrus and various regions, including the bilateral Crus1 of the cerebellum, the right insula, the bilateral angular gyrus, the left medial superior frontal gyrus, and the left middle cingulate gyrus (GRF: corrected, voxel level: P<0.05, mass level: P<0.05). In contrast, the low responders exhibited the enhanced FC between the left posterior cingulate gyrus and the left Crus2 of the cerebellum, the left middle temporal gyrus, the right posterior cingulate gyrus, and the left angular gyrus; besides, FC was reduced in low responders between the left posterior cingulate gyrus and the right supramarginal gyrus (GRF: corrected, voxel level: P<0.05, mass level: P<0.05). CONCLUSION: This study validates the practicality of pre-treatment ALFF feature prediction for acupuncture efficacy on neck pain. The therapeutic effect of acupuncture on neck pain is potentially associated with its impact on the default mode network, and then, alter the pain perception and emotional regulation.",

METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial. A total of 120 elderly patients (aged ≥65 years) scheduled for elective orthopedic lower limb surgery were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 60, buccal acupuncture 30 min before anesthesia induction until the end of surgery and for 30 min each day for the first 2 postoperative days) or the control group (n = 60, no buccal acupuncture). The primary outcome was delirium during the first 7 postoperative days. The secondary outcomes included delirium severity, duration, and subtype; intraoperative total consumption rate of sufentanil and remifentanil; interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and norepinephrine in venous blood; the total number of electronic analgesia pump compressions; nausea and vomiting in 48 h; postoperative pain score; postoperative hospital stay, and postoperative adverse event rates. RESULTS: The data of 120 patients were collected. The incidence of delirium during the first 7 postoperative days was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (27 % [16/60] vs. 12 % [7/60]; relative risk, 0.44; 95 % confidence interval, 0.19-0.99; P = 0.037). Intraoperative total consumption rate of sufentanil and remifentanil, postoperative pain scores, and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting were significantly lower in the intervention group. CONCLUSION: Buccal acupuncture can reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients who undergo orthopedic lower limb surgery.",

METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in the Wanfang, CNKI, Chinese Biomedical Literature, VIP, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for studies on the effects of acupuncture and moxibustion in treating simple obesity in children, published between December 2003 and October 2024. Primary clinical outcomes included blood lipids, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, weight-related indicators, clinical effects, leptin, body fat-related indicators, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes. Data were extracted and summarized, and a meta-analysis was performed using Revman 5.3 software and Stata 13.1. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies met the inclusion criteria, all involving acupuncture and moxibustion therapy. Compared with the control group, acupuncture and moxibustion significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC) (SMD = -0.53; 95% CI: -0.95 to -0.12, P<0.0001, I2 = 87.3%), triglyceride (TG) (SMD = -0.27; 95% CI: -0.54 to -0.01, P = 0.002, I2 = 66.7%), and fasting blood glucose levels (SMD = -0.61; 95% CI: -1.08 to -0.13, I2 = 82.2%, P = 0.001). Compared to metformin group, semaglutide combined with metformin led to significant reductions in body mass indexes (BMI) (SMD = -0.49, 95% CI: -0.80 to -0.18, I2 = 81%). Additionally, acupuncture treatment resulted in a decrease in TCM syndrome scores compared to control therapy (SMD = -1.49; 95% CI = -2.73 to 0.25; I2 = 96.4%, P<0.0001).

However, the underlying mechanism of Acu treatment's antidepressant effect remains unclear. Methods: We investigate the antidepressant effects of Acu treatment at the LR3 point in mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). GCaMP6m-based fiber-optic photometry was employed in the ventral CA1 (vCA1) regions for the first time to monitor Ca2+ transients in vivo during behavioral testing. Electrophysiological recordings were used to detect the activity and synaptic function of pyramidal neurons. Golgi staining was performed to measure the density of dendritic spines in the vCA1. Western blot analysis was conducted to quantify the expression levels of phosphorylated CaMKIIα, AMPA receptor protein (GluA1, GluA2), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. Results: Our findings indicated that Acu treatment significantly alleviated emotional deficits and restored the activity of pyramidal neurons, which were suppressed by CSDS. Acu treatment also reversed the decrease in spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs), thereby enhancing glutamatergic transmission. Moreover, Acu treatment improved synaptic plasticity, as evidenced by increased dendritic spine density and restored expression levels of phosphorylated CaMKIIα, GluA1, GluA2 and BDNF. Conclusion: Collectively, these findings suggest that Acu treatment alleviates depressive-like behaviors induced by CSDS and enhances synaptic function in the vCA1 region, potentially through mechanisms involving increased AMPAR trafficking and BDNF expression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The disorder of the intestinal fungal community is closely associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Gut fungal dysbiosis exacerbates β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque burden through the brain-gut axis, thereby promoting the progression of AD. Previous research has demonstrated that acupuncture can ameliorate AD symptoms by modulating the gut bacterial community. However, the potential regulatory effects of acupuncture on the fungal microbiota have been largely overlooked. METHODS: APP/PS1 mice were used as AD animal model and randomly divided into the AD model (AD) group, the acupuncture (Ac) group, and the probiotics (Pr) group. Mice in the Ac group received acupuncture treatment. In the Pr group, mice were treated with probiotics. Morris water maze, ITS sequencing, immunofluorescence (IF) staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Hematoxylin and eosin analysis, and Nissl staining were employed to validate our hypothesis. RESULTS: Acupuncture and probiotics significantly improved the behavioral performance of APP/PS1 mice, reduced the level of Aβ in the brain, and alleviated neuronal damage. Moreover, acupuncture improved the Sobs, Chao and Ace indices, decreased the abundance of Ascomycota, Aspergilaceae, Trichocomaceae, Candida, and unclassified-penicillium, while simultaneously increasing the abundance of Basidiomycota, which differed from the fungal regulation observed with probiotics. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture may improve the cognitive impairment of APP/PS1 mice, reduce Aβ plaque burden in the brain, protect neurons, and mitigate intestinal fungi dysbiosis. The beneficial effects of acupuncture on Aβ deposition and cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice may be achieved by regulating the intestinal fungal community."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively investigate the utilization patterns and clinical indications of acupuncture within the pediatric population in general hospitals from 2015 to 2020, including disease spectrum characteristics and relevance to pediatric subspecialties. METHODS: The clinical data of pediatric inpatients consulted by Acupuncture-Moxibustion and Tuina Department of Qilu Hospital of Shandong University was collected from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2020. The data collected include the number of wards in which consultation was requested, the diseases that require consultation, the distribution of pediatric tertiary disciplines and the system of disease affiliation. RESULTS: This study summarizes 55 types of pediatric diseases treated with acupuncture. The most common health issues addressed include peripheral facial paralysis, diarrhea, reduced limb mobility or decreased muscle strength, postoperative bloating, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Acupuncture is utilized across all pediatric subdisciplines, with notable applications in neurology, critical care medicine, general surgery, respiratory medicine, and orthopedics. The classification of diseases for acupuncture consultations primarily focuses on disorders of the nervous system, respiratory system, neoplasms, and digestive system (according to ICD-11). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, acupuncture has a broad range of applications in the treatment of pediatric diseases and can serve as a valuable complementary and alternative therapy. The advancement of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) acupuncture in general hospitals is closely linked to the involvement of pediatric practices. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for clinical practice, acupuncture education, pediatric healthcare systems, and social research.",

For years, it has been used in many countries to relieve labor pains, postoperative pains, pains caused by osteoarthritis, toothaches, and headaches. The World Health Organization (WHO) has significantly expanded the indications for the use of acupuncture. The primary aim of this article is to critically evaluate whether acupuncture is a scientifically validated therapeutic intervention or primarily a placebo effect? Material and methods: The material and methods section of this article involves a comprehensive review of existing literature, including systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and meta-analyses on acupuncture. The review also includes observational data on patient outcomes, potential risks, and reported complications. The effectiveness of acupuncture has been extensively studied, with varying levels of scientific support for different conditions. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the strongest evidence supports acupuncture's effectiveness in dental pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting, chemotherapy-induced nausea, and pregnancy-related nausea. Studies on lower back pain, headaches, and knee osteoarthritis have shown moderate benefits, leading some physicians to recommend acupuncture as a complementary therapy. An analysis of studies has shown the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of nausea and headaches. The results also showed the benefits of using this method in relieving back pain. Acupuncture has been shown to be one option for pain relief, but it needs more research.",

A total of 150 urticaria patients admitted to our hospital were randomly assigned to two groups: the observation group (n = 75) and the control group (n = 75). The control group received levocetirizine tablets, while the observation group was treated with modified Wendan Decoction along with acupuncture. Following treatment, the observation group demonstrated a higher clinical efficacy compared to the control group, with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). Both groups experienced reductions in symptom scores, including erythema, burning sensation, pruritus, wheals, fever accompanied by epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, and poor appetite. However, the observation group showed significantly lower symptom scores than the control group (P < 0.05). Additionally, levels of IL-4, IL-10, IL-25, IL-33, and IFN-γ decreased in both groups after treatment, but the observation group exhibited lower levels than the control group, again with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). The recurrence rate was notably lower in the observation group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The combination of modified Wendan Decoction and acupuncture effectively reduces serum inflammatory markers and enhances immune function in patients with urticaria. This treatment demonstrates significant clinical effectiveness and holds potential for broader application in clinical settings.",

Given its mechanism of action and efficacy, researchers have been recently attracted to address its efficacy in the treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR). Therefore, the present study aimed at evaluating the effect of acupuncture along with conventional therapies on the treatment of AR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present randomized, clinical trial was performed on 51 patients with AR. All patients underwent standard AR treatment under the supervision of a specialist physician. Twenty-four patients were treated with acupuncture and 27 patients were considered as the control group. The improvement degree of AR symptoms was evaluated and recorded at baseline, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks after the treatment. RESULTS: The results of this study revealed that a decrease in the runny nose score with a mean of 4.59 ± 3.04 and a decrease in the sneezing score with a mean of 5.30 ± 2.92 were significantly more than those of the control group with a means of 2.85 ± 1.56 and 2.78 ± 1.28, respectively (P value < 0.05). In addition, the frequency of nasal congestion, nasal itching, and tearing was significantly lower in the acupuncture group as compared with the control group (P value < 0.05). CONCLUSION: According to the results of the present study, although conventional AR treatments can be effective in reducing the symptoms of this disease, the use of acupuncture along with conventional AR treatments has been able to play an effective role in improving and reducing the severity of AR symptoms."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Modern acupuncture anesthesia is a combination of Chinese and Western medicine that integrates the theories of acupuncture with anesthesia. However, some clinical studies of acupuncture anesthesia lack specific descriptions of randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding processes, with subsequent systematic reviews indicating a risk of bias. OBJECTIVE: Clinical trial registration is essential for the enhancement of the quality of clinical trials. This study aims to summarize the status of clinical trial registrations for acupuncture anesthesia listed on the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the ICTRP for clinical trials related to acupuncture anesthesia registered between January 1, 2001 and May 31, 2023. Additionally, related publications were retrieved from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science and Technology Journal Database, and Wanfang Data. Registrations and publications were analyzed for consistency in trial design characteristics. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Clinical trials that utilized one of several acupuncture-related therapies in combination with pharmacological anesthesia during the perioperative period were eligible for this review. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extracted from articles included type of surgical procedure, perioperative symptoms, study methodology, type of intervention, trial recruitment information, and publication information related to clinical enrollment. RESULTS: A total of 166 trials related to acupuncture anesthesia from 21 countries were included in the analysis. The commonly reported symptoms in the included studies were postoperative nausea and vomiting (19.9%) and postoperative pain (13.3%). The concordance between the publications and the trial protocols in the clinical registry records was poor, with only 31.7% of the studies being fully compatible. Inconsistency rates were high for sample size (39.0%, 16/41), blinding (36.6%, 15/41), and secondary outcome indicators (24.4%, 10/41). CONCLUSION: The volume of acupuncture anesthesia clinical trials registered in international trial registries over the last 20 years is low, with insufficient disclosure of results. Postoperative nausea and vomiting as well as postoperative pain, are the most investigated for acupuncture intervention.

      "abstract": "Ultrasound-guided acupuncture is a novel technique that utilizes ultrasonography to visualize needle placement in real-time, enhancing precision and reducing adverse events. In South Korea, the dual medical system has led to disputes over Korean Medicine doctors' use of biomedical devices. However, in 2022, the Supreme Court ruled that Korean Medicine doctors' use of ultrasound devices is not illegal, enabling broader clinical application. Ultrasound-guided acupuncture involves inserting a needle to a precise depth to reach targeted tissue while applying manual techniques based on ultrasound-guided injection therapy principles. This technique requires ultrasonography with a linear probe and is commonly used to treat musculoskeletal conditions, such as shoulder pain. By improving accuracy, ultrasound-guided acupuncture enhances the effectiveness and safety of both traditional acupuncture and emerging techniques like acupotomy and pharmacopuncture. However, its clinical use remains limited due to the lack of national health insurance coverage and insufficient clinical evidence. To establish its efficacy and safety, comparative clinical trials should first focus on musculoskeletal disorders, pain management, and neurological conditions, which are among its most frequent applications in Korea."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Opioid misuse and dependence remain critical public health issues in the U.S., contributing significantly to reduced life expectancy. Emergency departments (EDs) are key settings for implementing opioid reduction strategies when treating acute pain, such as nonpharmacologic treatment options like acupuncture. This study explored clinician-related factors influencing the integration of the Pain Elimination through Acupuncture Research and Learning (PEARL) program for pain reduction within a high-volume urban ED. METHODS: This study employed a sequential mixed methods design, involving surveys and interviews with ED clinicians. An 11-item electronic survey was administered annually to assess clinician attitudes related to appropriateness and effectiveness of integrating acupuncture into the ED's comprehensive care plan for treatment of pain. Near the end of the 3rd year of the PEARL program, semi-structured interviews were conducted to gather in-depth insights into clinician knowledge and perceptions of the program. RESULTS: Quantitative survey data from 99 eligible ED clinicians indicated positive perceptions of the program's appropriateness and effectiveness, and improved understanding of acupuncture referral procedures. Analysis of qualitative interviews conducted with 16 ED clinicians revealed five key themes: acupuncture as an acceptable analgesic strategy to reduce the use of opioids, patient benefits, program presence in the ED, integration challenges, and the need for continued education. CONCLUSION: Strong acceptance of acupuncture as a feasible nonpharmacologic addition to the comprehensive pain care plan used in the ED was observed. Dedicated space, expanded acupuncture staff and hours, and ongoing training of ED staff will require institutional support to sustain acupuncture as a nonpharmacologic treatment option for ED patients.",

      "abstract": "Acupuncture, rooted in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), serves as a complementary and alternative therapeutic modality that involves the insertion of needles into specific body points to stimulate and treat a variety of conditions. Over time, acupuncture has garnered global acceptance, progressively addressing an increasing spectrum of medical disorders. The integration of nanotechnology holds considerable potential to improve drug delivery efficacy and broaden the scope of acupuncture's applications, providing novel opportunities for investigating the underlying principles of meridians and acupoints. A bibliometric analysis of the application of nanotechnology in acupuncture over the past two decades (2004-2024) highlights emerging research trends and focal points in the field. This article provides an overview of the history, biological mechanisms, preparation methods, and clinical research status of nanoacupuncture, with a focus on analyzing the applications of nanoacupuncture technology. Nanotechnology enables the visualization and imaging of meridians and acupoints, facilitating a deeper understanding of the physiological mechanisms behind acupuncture's therapeutic effects. Modified acupuncture needles incorporating nanotechnology can serve dual purposes: functioning as sensors for real-time monitoring of various physiological parameters, thereby supporting disease diagnosis and enhancing therapeutic efficacy through specialized interventions. Furthermore, nanotechnology-enhanced acupuncture needles can act as platforms for targeted drug delivery working in tandem with responsive nanoparticles for disease treatment. Despite its promising potential and clinical applicability, nanoacupuncture faces inherent limitations and challenges that must be addressed.",

Scalp acupuncture (SA) has shown potential as a non-pharmacological treatment for post-stroke aphasia (PSA). As the location of SA in PSA treatment is controversial, this study aims to utilize neuroimaging techniques for identifying and validation the promising target. METHODS: The study was divided into two phases. In phase Ⅰ, three pipelines, including lesion mapping, meta-analysis, and resting-state functional connectivity, were integrated for identifying the potential targets. In phase Ⅱ, Centro-square needling manipulations were then applied to evaluate the SA prescription in patients with PSA. RESULTS: The left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) was chosen as one of the promising targets as it had the highest occurrence among the outcomes of three pipelines. It has been discovered that the Centro-square needling technique applied to the left MTG can immediately enhance the reduced functional connectivity (FC) between the left MTG and the middle frontal gyrus caused by diseases. Moreover, it enhances the FC between the left MTG and the superior temporal gyrus, which may constitute the therapeutic mechanism underlying its efficacy in improving the verb understanding scores on the Chinese Rehabilitation Research Center Standard Aphasia Examination scale. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the SA protocol integrating traditional Chinese medicine and neuroimaging may help refine the locations for the treatment of PSA.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insomnia is a common sleep disorder, and this meta-analysis aimed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of eye acupuncture combined with other therapies in treating insomnia. METHODS: In this comprehensive meta-analysis, we conducted a systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of eye acupuncture as a treatment for insomnia, a widespread sleep disorder. Our literature search spanned multiple databases, including Wanfang, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wipo Information Chinese Periodicals Service Platform, China Biology Medicine, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase, covering the period from their inception to February 1, 2024, and including both Chinese and English publications. The article included randomized controlled trials comparing eye acupuncture combined with other treatments versus non-eye acupuncture treatments for insomnia. Data extraction was independently conducted by 2 evaluators, and the risk of bias was rigorously assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. The synthesis of data involved a meta-analysis using RevMan 5.3 software, complemented by sensitivity analysis comparing fixed and random effects models to enhance the robustness of our findings. RESULTS: This study involved 13 clinical studies involving 856 patients with insomnia.The meta-analysis findings indicated that the combined eye acupuncture treatment exhibited significantly superior clinical efficacy compared to either drug treatment or non-drug treatment alone (odds ratio = 3.71, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.18-6.32, Z = 4.82, P < .00001). Compared with the control group, the intervention group exhibited a lower Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score (PSQI; mean difference [MD] = -2.46, 95% CI [-3.07, -1.85], Z = 7.87, P < .00001). Moreover, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Symptom Score (TCMSS) of the intervention group decreased more than that of the control group (MD = -1.51, 95% CI [-2.80, -0.22], Z = 2.29, P = .02). In the documentation of adverse reactions, a single study reported that 2 patients experienced mild subcutaneous hemorrhage following eye acupuncture treatment, which resolved spontaneously post-treatment. CONCLUSION: The combination of eye acupuncture with other therapies in the treatment of insomnia can enhance clinical efficacy, reduce the TCMSS and the PSQI score, and effectively improve insomnia outcomes.",

Literature on acupuncture in clinical settings was retrieved and analyzed in this study utilizing the Web of Science database. A visualization analysis of the scientific landscape was performed using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and GraphPad Prism. General statistics regarding the literature were examined, encompassing annual publication trends, citation frequencies, journal distributions, distributions across subject fields. Co-occurrence and cluster analyses of authors, countries, institutions, high-quality literature, and keywords were performed to explore the developmental trends, hotspots, and frontiers in acupuncture research comprehensively and intuitively. A total of 4554 studies were included, with an increasing trend in the number of publications related to the annual acupuncture Scientific Citation Index (SCI). The impact factors of the top 10 journals were mostly 1 to 3 points. The 10 most cited articles primarily concentrated on the use of acupuncture for pain-related disorders. Acupuncture and electroacupuncture are the dominant keywords, with terms such as \"ischemic stroke\" and \"Alzheimer's disease\" emerging from 2019 to 2022. From 2013 to 2022, the output of clinical SCI literature on acupuncture increased, acupuncture research gradually gained international recognition, and China gradually moved toward a dominant position. The most significant clinical research area of acupuncture is its application for analgesia, particularly through acupuncture and electroacupuncture. Future research directions may include the treatment of knee osteoarthritis, cognitive disorders, and assisted reproduction utilizing acupuncture.",

AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of body and facial acupuncture on reducing frown lines in women aged 30-59 in Mashhad, Iran. PATIENTS/METHODS: In this double-arm randomized wait-list controlled trial, 72 participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group, receiving facial and body acupuncture twice weekly for 6 weeks, or a control group with no treatment. The primary outcome was assessed using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) based on standardized photographs. Secondary outcomes included the Subject Satisfaction Scale (SSS) and Quality of Life (QOL) scores. Measurements were taken at three time points: week 0 (pre-treatment), week 7 (post-treatment), and week 12 (follow-up). RESULTS: At week 7, 63% of the intervention group showed reduced frown lines at rest, and 72% during maximum frowning, significantly outperforming the control group. The improvements observed in the intervention group persisted at week 12 with 68.6% at rest and 57.2% at maximum frown. The SSS indicated that 72.2% and 62.9% of the intervention group were satisfied with their frown lines at weeks 7 and 12, respectively. Notable QOL improvements in social functioning were observed in the intervention group compared to the control group at both weeks 7 and 12. No serious adverse effects were reported; minor bleeding occurred in 4.86% of treatment sessions, resulting in bruising in 0.69%. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that facial and body acupuncture is an effective and safe method for reducing frown lines.

Intranasal acupuncture therapy (IAT), an innovative therapy that involves the precise insertion of acupuncture needles into specific nasal acupoints, has demonstrated potential effects in managing AR. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of IAT in the management of AR. METHODS: Nine databases were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from their inception to September 2024. We included participants who were diagnosed with AR and who received IAT alone or as add-on treatment to conventional treatment. The Cochrane risk of bias 2.0 tool and the GRADE approach were used to assess the quality of the studies. A meta-analysis was performed via RevMan 5.4.1 software. RESULTS: Twenty-one RCTs with 1889 participants were included. The certainty of evidence was generally low or moderate. Compared with sham acupuncture, the IAT significantly reduced the total nasal symptom score (MD -2.65, 95% CI -4.01 to -1.29, 1 RCT, 30 participants, moderate evidence). Compared to an antihistamine, IAT was associated with a lower total nasal non-symptom score (MD -0.44, 95% CI -0.64 to -0.25, 5 RCTs, 295 participants, moderate evidence) and a better quality of life measured by the rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (MD -13.72, 95% CI -18.01 to -9.43, 4 RCTs, 255 participants, moderate evidence). No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: The IAT may be beneficial for improving AR-related symptoms and quality of life. However, the safety of the IAT remains unclear due to inadequate reporting. Further high-quality, rigorously designed, and well-reported trials are needed.

This study aimed to investigate and compare the effectiveness of wet cupping therapy (WCT) and acupuncture applications in treating migraine patients. MATERIALS AND METHOD: This was a randomized controlled clinical trial conducted between 01.03.2022 and 01.10.2023 in the Traditional and Complementary Medicine Center of a tertiary hospital. Patients diagnosed with migraine were included in the study and randomized into three arms. The WCT group received cupping 3 times, once a month. The acupuncture group received 10 sessions of acupuncture once a week. The waiting list was assigned as the control group. VAS and MIDAS scales were applied to all groups at the beginning and the end of the treatment, and the results were compared. RESULTS: All three groups were similar regarding age and sex. Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores decreased significantly in both treatment groups after the applications, while they remained similar for the same period in the control group. Additionally, the post-treatment values of MIDAS and VAS in both the WCT and acupuncture groups were significantly lower compared to controls, while they were similar when compared in between. CONCLUSION: Both of these applications were found to be similarly effective in improving disability status and pain intensity in patients with migraine."

METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang electronic databases were searched up to July 2024 to identify relevant randomized controlled trials. RevMan 5.4 software and Addis software were used to assess the risk of bias for each study, determine subgroup classifications, and conduct meta-analyses. RESULTS: A total of 29 RCTs involving 659 animals were ultimately included. The meta-analysis results revealed that acupuncture treatment had a significant effect compared with the vascular dementia model group [mean difference (MD) = - 21.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) (- 25.77, - 17.59), P < 0.00001]. Manual acupuncture demonstrated better efficacy than electroacupuncture did [MD = - 0.42, 95% CI (- 12.72, 12.27)]. Among the different acupuncture point combinations, the Baihui (GV20) + Dazhui (GV14) combination yielded the best efficacy [MD = - 23.03, 95% CI (- 30.02, - 16.04), P < 0.00001]. Compared with other acupuncture protocols, the experiment conducted by Caiyu Peng et al. exhibited superior efficacy [MD = - 24.96, 95% CI (- 92.68, - 40.76)]. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture significantly improves cognitive function in rats with vascular dementia. Manual acupuncture is more effective than electroacupuncture. Among the different acupuncture point combinations, manual acupuncture at GV20 and GV14 yields the best results. Compared with other acupuncture protocols, the best efficacy was observed when the two-vessel occlusion (2VO) model was used in 230 ± 10 g SD rats; when the Mingmen (GV4), Dazhui (GV14), Fengfu (GV16), Baihui (GV20), Shenting (GV24), Shuigou (GV26), Neiguan (PC6), Dalin (PC7), and Laogong (PC8) acupoints were selected; and when manual acupuncture with reinforcing and reducing methods was used for 30 min per day for 14 days.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Substance use disorders (SUDs) are common and highly disabling, causing serious long-term harm to people's health. Despite the existence of evidence-based interventions for treating SUDs, many individuals remain symptomatic regardless of treatment, and relapse is common. Acupuncture has been examined for the treatment of SUDs, but available evidence is mixed. This comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis aims to provide updated evidence which will include both English and Chinese studies to investigate the effectiveness and safety of different types of acupuncture for the treatment of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug use disorders. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol is guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analysis Protocols. A thorough search for relevant studies in multiple electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, Wan-fang and China Biomedical Database) and clinical trial registries will be conducted. Population-Intervention-Comparator-Outcomes-Study design criteria will be adopted for study inclusion. Only randomised controlled trials analysing the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for SUDs will be included. Two reviewers will independently conduct the study selection, data extraction and quality assessment, and disagreements will be solved by a third senior reviewer or by contacting study authors. Frequency and quantity of substance use, abstinence rate, withdrawal symptoms, treatment drop-out and relapse rates are primary outcomes. Functional status, health-related quality of life and adverse events are secondary outcomes. The risk of bias and quality of evidence will be assessed by the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials and guidelines of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group, respectively. When sufficient data is available, subgroup analyses will be performed to further compare the differences in the primary and secondary outcomes based on the type of substance use, acupuncture, co-intervention status, comparison group, measurement tools, length of follow-up, risk of bias of included studies and countries of studies conducted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No private information is used in the entire process of the systematic review. Therefore, ethical approval is not required. Findings of the proposed systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and/or disseminated through conference presentations. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The protocol has been archived in the Prospero repository (PROSPERO 2024 CRD42024566389).",

      "abstract": "Acupuncture treatment had achieved good clinical effects on treat or ameliorate chronic diseases. Exosomes are crucial for transmitting information and network regulation in acupuncture, and their content could be essential for acupuncture's effects. However, there remains a critical need for a highly sensitive approach to detect exosomes in acupuncture therapy studies, particularly for rapid and precise analysis. Herein, a graphene oxide-aptamer hydrogel microneedle sensor (GOA-HMS) was designed for exosome point of care testing (POCT) on acupuncture treatment. The sensor was fabricated by cross-linking of aminophenylboronic acid (APBA)-modified sodium alginate with chondroitin sulfate and GO nanosheets conjugated with a fluorophore-modified nucleic acid aptamer, in which GO served as a quencher. In the absence of the target exosome, the aptamer binds tightly into the GO, quenching the fluorophore labels. In the presence of exosome, the aptamer binds to the targets, causing a conformational change which alters the distance the fluorescent moieties from the GO, leading to fluorescence recovery and the generation of fluorescent signals. This sensor showed a linear range of 105-109 particles/mL and has a detection limit of 1 particles/mL with an excellent precision of 4.3 % (RSD) for seven repeated detections of 107 particles/mL exosome, demonstrating the feasibility of both point-of-care clinical diagnostics and high throughput. Meanwhile, typical enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay further verified the measurement accuracy by this GOA-HMS. The GOA-HMS was successfully applied to exosome detection in acupuncture treatment, providing a non-invasive, in situ tool for monitoring patient responses in real-time and investigating acupuncture mechanisms.",

METHODS: A prospective, single-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was conducted on SjD patients experiencing dry eyes and dry mouth. Forty-six patients were randomized and 27 completed the study (acupuncture, n = 15; sham, n = 12). Patients received either acupuncture or sham acupuncture (control) weekly for 8 weeks. Key outcomes, including Schirmer test (ST), corneal fluorescein staining score, tear film break-up time, Ocular Surface Disease Index, unstimulated whole salivary flow (UWSF), EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI), Xerostomia Inventory (XI) score, Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) score, and Challacombe scale, were measured at baseline, immediately after treatment, and 4 weeks later. Statistical analysis consisted of comparing outcomes between groups over time. RESULTS: The acupuncture group exhibited significant improvement in total ESSPRI and ESSPRI dryness scores. The positive effects persisted for at least 4 weeks after the completion of treatment. Furthermore, the acupuncture group exhibited improvement over time in the ESSPRI fatigue domain, ESSPRI pain domain, OHIP-14, XI, UWSF, and ST. No other statistically significant differences were observed. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture is effective in relieving dryness in SjD patients. Larger samples and longer observation periods are necessary to better understand the effectiveness of this intervention in SjD. (NCT04056221/ 18/02/2019). Key Points • Acupuncture is a low-cost method with few side effects • Acupuncture exerts a symptom-relieving effect in primary Sjögren's disease patients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sleep deprivation (SD) has been associated with cognitive deficits, mediated by mechanisms such as neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Acupuncture, a core component of traditional Chinese medicine, has shown promise in mitigating SD-induced cognitive impairment. However, the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of acupuncture need further validation through high-quality evidence. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects and molecular mechanisms of acupuncture on cognitive impairment resulting from SD by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: This study comprehensively searched eight databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examine the effects of acupuncture on SD-induced cognitive impairment. Primary outcomes were assessed using the Morris Water Maze (MWM), including measures of escape latency and time spent in the target quadrant. Secondary outcomes focused on molecular markers such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), and indicators of oxidative stress. The risk of bias was evaluated using the SYRCLE tool, and data were analyzed using R software. Standardized mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: Eight RCTs involving 222 rodents were analyzed. The findings indicate that acupuncture significantly improves cognitive performance in SD models, evidenced by increased platform crossings [MD = 1.67, 95% CI (1.42, 1.91)] and extended time in the target quadrant [MD = 8.54, 95% CI (6.35, 10.73)], along with reduced escape latency [MD = -8.33, 95% CI (-11.68, -4.99)]. Electroacupuncture (EA) was found to regulate the expression of BDNF and its receptor, TrkB, and to decrease oxidative stress markers such as malondialdehyde (MDA) while enhancing antioxidant activities, including those of superoxide dismutase (SOD). Manual acupuncture (MA) influenced apoptosis markers by decreasing Bax and increasing Bcl-2 expression. Despite these positive findings, the studies exhibited heterogeneity in intervention methods and variability in acupuncture techniques. CONCLUSION: This study preliminarily confirms that acupuncture, specifically electroacupuncture, and manual acupuncture, can effectively alleviate cognitive impairment caused by sleep deprivation. The benefits are observed through modulation of BDNF-TrkB signaling, reduction in oxidative stress, and regulation of apoptosis. Although the current evidence is derived from animal studies, it suggests potential applications in human clinical trials to explore the viability of acupuncture for treating cognitive impairment related to SD.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating nape back myofascial pain syndrome (MPS). METHODS: The literature on randomized controlled trials of acupuncture in the treatment of nape back MPS was retrieved by searching nine databases. Review Manager 5.4 software was used to merge and statistically analyze the extracted data, and Stata 18.0 was used to assess the risk of bias. RESULTS: Finally, 10 randomized controlled trials were included, with a total of 624 samples. The meta-analysis results indicated that acupuncture therapy could lower the NDI score [MD=-6.64, 95% CI (-10.95, -2.33), Z = 3.02, P = 0.003]. Acupuncture demonstrated superiority over the control group in addressing nape back myofascial pain condition, which reflected that the VAS score of the acupuncture treatment group was significantly lower than that of other treatment controls [SMD=-0.71, 95% CI (-1.07, -0.36), Z = 3.94, P < 0.0001]. Furthermore, in contrast to the control group, the improvement of PPT and right flexion CROM and rotation CROM in the acupuncture group was more evident (PPT: [MD = 0.95, 95% CI (0.63, 1.27), P < 0.001]) (right flexion CROM: [MD = 4.86, 95% CI (1.61, 8.12), P = 0.003]), (rotation CROM: [MD = 0.52, 95% CI (0.43,0.61), P < 0.00001]). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that acupuncture is more effective in treating nape back MPS than the control group and provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating nape back MPS, filling a gap in the treatment of nape back MPS by Traditional Chinese Medicine."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute skin infections, like cellulitis or erysipelas, are common and respond well to antibiotic treatment. However, complete resolution of the inflammatory process is often slow and associated with prolonged pain and reduced mobility. Several studies have indicated that acupuncture may effectively treat inflammatory skin diseases. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture for treating cellulitis in patients hospitalized in internal medicine departments. METHODS: In this pilot randomized sham-controlled trial, patients hospitalized with cellulitis in internal medicine departments were randomized to acupuncture or sham acupuncture, in addition to standard care. The primary outcome was the degree of improvement in the cellulitis score at day 4 of hospitalization. Secondary endpoints included patient pain self-assessment and local and systemic inflammatory signs. RESULTS: The study comprised 29 patients; 15 treated with acupuncture, 14 by a sham procedure. At day 4, patients in the acupuncture arm had an improved cellulitis score (4.1 ± 2.8) compared with the sham-control group (7.9 ± 3.3, P = 0.003). Pain intensity based on the Visual Assessment Scale was lower in the acupuncture group 3.8 ± 2.7 vs. 6.3 ± 2.8; P = 0.023. There was no difference in the rate of leukocyte change. However, C-reactive protein significantly decreased to 27.0 ± 22.1 mg/L at day 4 following acupuncture compared to 63.9 ± 51.9 mg/L (P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: In our pilot study, we found acupuncture to be efficacious as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of leg cellulitis. A large-scale trial on the effectiveness of acupuncture for skin infections is needed.",

With the updating of randomized controlled trials, it is necessary to reassess its efficacy. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of hot flashes in patients with breast cancer. METHODS: Up to March 2024, we retrieved data from nine databases and used Stata software (version 14.0, version 17.0) and RevMan software (version 5.3) to conduct a meta-analysis. The Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias assessment tool was used for methodological assessment of the risk of bias, and the GRADEpro GDT online assessment tool was used for evidence evaluation. RESULTS: In total, 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involved 963 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The result of risk of bias revealed that the included RCTs exhibited a high risk of bias, primarily attributable to deficiencies in randomization and blinding methods. The results of primary meta-analysis indicated that acupuncture can improved the hot flash symptom scale score (SMD, -0.54; 95% CI, -0.83 to -0.24; P < 0.05). However, acupuncture does not reduce the frequency of hot flashes(SMD, -0.20; 95% CI, -0.75 to 0.36; P = 0.48). Further subgroup analyses, including the type of control group and the duration of needle retention, etc. showed different results, highlighting the necessity for further research. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the reliability of these finding. In addition, due to various issues, the level of evidence is low. CONCLUSIONS: Although acupuncture treatment for hot flashes in breast cancer shows potential, the evidence for the efficacy of acupuncture is still lacking due to various factors such as bias risk and significant differences between studies, and more high-quality RCTs are needed to confirm the efficacy of acupuncture.

AIM: To retrospectively study the clinical efficacy of modified Lou Bei Er Chen decoction combined with acupuncture in treating patients with GERD after radical gastrectomy due to gastric cancer. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted, including patients with gastric cancer or malignant tumors of the stomach from January 2019 to December 2023 in the Affiliated Taizhou People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. Patients with a TCM diagnosis of qi depression and phlegm obstruction (n = 128) were selected on the basis of prescription and treatment principles. They were then divided into a control group (n = 61) and an observation group (n = 67). The control group received treatment with Western medicine domperidone. The observation group were treated with Lou Bei Er Chen decoction orally, with acupuncture at specific acupoints (bilateral Hegu, bilateral Neiguan, and bilateral Zusanli), in addition to the treatment as in the control group, for a continuous treatment period of 8 weeks. The improvement time of postoperative gastrointestinal function indicators, gastrointestinal dysfunction scores, GERD-Q scores, and TCM syndrome scores were further observed for both groups. RESULTS: The observation group showed significantly shorter times for first flatus, defecation, bowel sound recovery, and initiation of nasogastric enteral nutrition than the control group (P < 0.05). Upon treatment, the two groups demonstrated a significant reduction in gastrointestinal dysfunction scores, with a more significant reduction in the observation group (P < 0.001). The GERD-Q scores significantly decreased after 8 weeks of treatment in the two groups (P < 0.05), with a significant reduction in the observation group (P < 0.05), compared with baseline. The TCM syndrome scores significantly decreased after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment in the two groups (P < 0.05), with a significant reduction in the observation group (P < 0.05). The effective rate of the observation group after 8 weeks of treatment was significantly higher than that after 4 weeks (χ 2 = 13.648, P = 0.003), and it was significantly higher than that of control group (χ 2 = 13.879, P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Lou Bei Er Chen decoction combined with acupuncture treatment can effectively alleviate clinical symptoms in patients GERD after gastric cancer surgery and improve their life quality. It is worthy of further promotion and application."

      "abstract": "Tic disorders (TD) refer to a condition where individuals experience recurring motor movements (e.g., eye blinking) and/or vocalizations (e.g., throat clearing). These disorders vary in terms of duration, cause, and manifestation of symptoms. Tourette's syndrome (TS) involves the presence of ongoing motor and vocal tics for a minimum of 1 year, with fluctuating intensity. Persistent chronic motor or vocal tic disorder is characterized by either motor or vocal tics (not both) present for at least 1 year. Provisional TD presents with either motor or vocal tics (not both) that have been present for less than 12 months. Though medications like Aripiprazole and dopamine receptor blockers are frequently prescribed, their potential unwanted consequences increase, may result in low adherence. In an effort to improve and broaden the care available for children diagnosed with TD, alternative methods such as acupuncture are being investigated and considered. Acupuncture is a method of traditional Chinese medicine that includes the placement of thin needles into particular areas of the body in order to correct any disruptions or irregularities. Research has demonstrated that acupuncture can help regulate abnormal brain function and relieve tic symptoms in individuals with TD. Additional studies are required to fully evaluate the usefulness of complementary treatments in addressing TD in young individuals, despite its common usage. Herein, we summarized the therapeutic effects of acupuncture in the treatment of TD."

      "abstract": "In recent years, researchers have conducted in-depth research on the mechanism of acupuncture analgesia and made many important discoveries. These studies indicate that acupuncture can effectively alleviate pain and improve pain mood. This article summarizes the mechanisms of acupuncture treatment for different types of pain, including peripheral input effects, spinal cord response effects, and brain integration effects. It provides support for the idea that acupuncture analgesia is not a local reaction through a single pathway, but a holistic effect with network connections. However, it is unclear whether the peripheral, spinal cord, and brain levels have equal analgesic effects during the analgesic process, or which level dominates the analgesic effect; The issue of whether the dominant analgesic level is consistent for different types of pain has not been resolved and further experimental research is needed.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare three rehabilitation treatments, exercise therapy, acupuncture, and silicon oxide tablets (Stiper®), in women undergoing breast cancer surgery, assessing pain, depression, upper limb function, and range of motion parameters (ROM). METHODS: Seventy-nine women with pain above 3 on the visual analog pain scale (VAS) were divided into three groups: exercise group was treated with exercise therapy, acupuncture group was treated with acupuncture, and Stiper® group was treated with silicon oxide tablets in place of needles. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients completed the treatment, 26 from exercise group, 23 from acupuncture group, and 18 from Stiper® group . There was an improvement of pain over time in all groups, the first session compared with the fifth (p < 0.001) and with the tenth (p < 0.001), but not between groups. There was a statistically significant difference in depressive symptoms using the Beck questionnaire over time in the three groups, between the first and tenth sessions (p = 0.001), between the first and fifth sessions (p = 0.052), but not between groups. Regarding the DASH questionnaire for shoulder function, there were significant differences over time at all evaluated moments (p<0.001), but not between groups. There was a statistically significant difference in ROM over time in the three groups, but not between groups. CONCLUSION: The rehabilitation of physical dysfunctions in women who survived breast cancer through exercise therapy, acupuncture, and silicon oxide tablets in pain, depression, upper limb function, and ROM, proved to be effective, without statistical difference between the groups.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of three different rehabilitation treatments (exercise therapy, acupuncture, and silicon oxide tablets (Stiper®) in women who have undergone breast cancer surgery. The study assessed the impact of these treatments on strength, lymphedema, and quality of life. METHODS: The study included seventy-nine women who reported pain levels above 3 on the visual analog pain scale (VAS) and had undergone surgery more than 90 days prior. Group I received exercise therapy for 30 minutes, Group II received acupuncture for 30 minutes using predefined points, and Group III received acupuncture at the same points as Group II using silicon oxide instead of needles at the same points as Group II. RESULTS: The results showed an improvement in upper limb muscle strength over time in all groups, except for abduction and internal rotation movements. During treatment, there was no increase in the number of patients with lymphedema, and there was no statistical difference between the groups. Nine out of the fifteen factors analyzed in the EORTC QLQ-C30 quality of life questionnaire showed significant differences between sessions. The factors that did not show significant differences between the three groups were Social Function, Nausea and Vomiting, Dyspnea, Loss of Appetite, Constipation, and Diarrhea. CONCLUSION: The rehabilitation of physical dysfunctions in women who survived breast cancer through exercise therapy, acupuncture, and silicon oxide tablets in upper limb muscle strength, lymphedema, and quality of life, proved to be effective, without difference between groups.",

      "abstract": "RATIONALE: Herpes zoster is a common skin disease that manifests as clustered herpes, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), and other herpes zoster-related complications, as well as eye diseases and various visceral diseases. Pharmaceutical therapy may cause adverse responses and has limited efficacy. Therefore, exploring alternative and effective therapies is important for clinical physicians. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient was a 62-year-old female. She suffered from clustered herpes in her left forehead and head, which caused severe pain. The patient had received pharmaceutical therapy but did not respond to it. DIAGNOSES: Cephalofacial herpes zoster. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent a 1-week course (4 sessions) of subcutaneous acupuncture. The treatment involved fire acupuncture (swift pricking) and common acupuncture (transverse insertion), both of which were performed on the superficial skin layer. OUTCOMES: After the 4 treatment sessions, the patient's herpes disappeared quickly, and the pain was relieved. After the 12-month follow-up, the patient had no PHN. LESSONS: Subcutaneous acupuncture improved the skin lesions condition of herpes zoster rapidly, and relieved the neuralgia effectively. It may prevent the PHN. For patients who are nonresponsive to antiviral medications, especially the elderly population at a high risk of developing PHN, subcutaneous acupuncture (fire acupuncture + common acupuncture) can be considered.",
