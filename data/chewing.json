      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Khat contains alkaloids, tannins, and flavonoids with physiological and pathological effects. In Yemen, anorectal diseases, including hemorrhoids, are prevalent, and hemorrhoidectomy is frequently performed. PURPOSE: This study evaluates the relationship between chronic khat chewing and high-grade hemorrhoidal disease, as well as post-operative complications such as bleeding and pain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study included 1,896 patients aged 16-85 years, meeting the inclusion criteria were included and followed for three months. PATIENTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: Chronic khat chewers (n=1,492) and non-khat chewers (n=404) Data included khat habits, clinical assessments, digital rectal exams, anoproctoscopy, intraoperative findings, and post-operative outcomes. RESULTS: Chronic khat chewing was strongly associated with thrombosed grade IV hemorrhoidal disease. Among khat chewers, 90% had hemorrhoids, with 75% requiring hemorrhoidectomy or hemorrhoidopexy, compared to 25% in non-chewers, where half underwent hemorrhoidopexy. The odds ratio (OR) for hemorrhoids in khat chewers was 27.04. Gender-specific analysis showed a six-fold higher OR for hemorrhoids in khat-chewing females versus non-chewing females. Post-operative complications, including bleeding and severe pain, were significantly higher in male khat chewers (p < 0.05), while no significant differences were observed in females. CONCLUSION: Chronic khat chewing is strongly associated with high-grade hemorrhoidal disease and increased post-operative complications. Mechanisms include chronic constipation, increased anal sphincter tone, and prolonged sitting. These findings highlight the need for public health strategies to reduce khat use and tailored clinical approaches to improve outcomes. Future research should focus on establishing causality, identifying confounders, dose-response relationships, and exploring gender-specific management strategies that target both mechanical and pharmacological factors to optimize surgical care and long-term outcomes."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was conducted as a prospective, randomized controlled single-blind interventional study. Patients were randomized into two groups: control group which received a standard postoperative protocol and the chewing gum group which received the same postoperative protocol. Pain was evaluated by the Wong Baker scale. RESULTS: A total of 75 patients participated in the study, with 40 in the control group and 35 in the chewing gum group. The children's mean age and gender distribution were similar across the groups. According to the independent t-test results, there was a significant difference in pain levels between the chewing gum and control groups on all days. The pain levels in the chewing gum group were lower compared to the control group. Analgesic use was also lower in the gum group on all days (p < 0.05). Generalized linear mixed model analysis confirmed a significant independent effect of chewing gum on pain scores (p < 0.001), though the effect did not vary over time. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, chewing gum may serve as a non-pharmacological method for postoperative pain management. In clinical practice, chewing gum could be a simple, low-cost, and easy-to-implement intervention."

      "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the quantitative (joint spaces, condylar position, morphology, and fossa) and qualitative (bone mineral density (BMD), condylar volume (CV), and condylar surface area (CSA)) therapeutic outcomes following a stabilization splint (S.S.) therapy in adult patients diagnosed with temporomandibular disorder (TMD) (Arthralgia) with/without chewing side preference (CSP) using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). This retrospective study included 64 patients divided into two groups: 32 with TMD + CSP and 32 with TMD only. TMD was diagnosed using the Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (DC/TMD) AXIS I. The Observed Preferred Chewing Side (OPCS) and State Preferred Chewing Side (SPCS) methods assessed CSP status. CBCT scanned the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) before (T0) and after (T1) treatment for three-dimensional (3D) analysis. Statistical comparisons were made using the Wilcoxon signed ranks and Mann-Whitney U tests. The treatment duration ranged from 6 to 12 months, with an average of 9.5 months. In the TMD + CSP group, significant differences were observed between pre-treatment (T0) and post-treatment (T1) for joint space measures, including (SJS, PJS, and CLS) on the preferred side (p-value = 0.04; 0.00; 0.02, respectively), with significant differences for the balancing side in (SJS, PJS, and CMS) (p-value = 0.01; 0.03; 0.016 respectively). The TMD group showed significant changes in (AJS) on both symptomatic and contralateral sides (p-value = 0.015; 0.01 respectively). Morphologically, significant differences were noted in condyle width (CL2) in the TMD + CSP group on the preferred side between T0 and T1, along with significant differences in intra-group comparison in fossa height (FH), fossa width (FW), and articular eminence (θ) at T0, with FW and θ remaining significant at T1 (p-value = 0.01; 0.02; 0.01; 0.00, and 0.04 respectively). The TMD group exhibited significant changes in condylar length (CL1) on both sides between T0 and T1 (p-value = 0.03; 0.01 respectively). Qualitatively, BMD disturbance was significant in the TMD + CSP on the preferred side group across the majority of slopes when compared to the balancing side between T0 and T1 and for intragroup comparison at T0 and T1, while in TMD group showed changes on the symptomatic side in (AS) only when compared to the contralateral side between T0 and T1and for intragroup comparison at T0 (p-value = 0.035; 0.045; and 0.01 respectively). Additionally, significant differences in CV and CSA were observed in the TMD + CSP group on the preferred side between T0 and T1 (p-value = 0.04; 0.03 respectively), with intra-group comparisons highlighting significant differences in both CV and CSA at T0 and T1 (p-value = 0.01; 0.02; < 0.001; 0.03, respectively). The co-occurrence of TMD + CSP exacerbates TMD severity and affects both quantitative and qualitative measures. This condition leads to asymmetrical condylar positions, distinct morphological changes, and imbalance in BMD, increasing the risk of degenerative changes over time.",

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of different types of herbal gums on POST management. DESIGN: A randomized controlled, blinded, prospective, experimental study. METHODS: This study was carried out between June and October 2023 in a research and training hospital. A total of 72 patients scheduled for cholecystectomy were randomly assigned to one of four groups in the preoperative period: control, mastic, xylitol, and propolis groups. No intervention was applied to the control group, while patients in the experimental groups chewed either mastic-flavored, xylitol, or propolis gum. Patients in the experimental groups chewed sugar-free gum for 15 minutes immediately before surgery. The incidence and severity of sore throat were evaluated upon admission to the postanesthesia recovery unit and at the 1st, 2nd, 6th, and 24th hours postoperatively. Descriptive statistics, χ2, Fisher's Exact, Independent samples t test, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used in the analysis of the data. FINDINGS: There was no significant difference in POST severity between the groups at admission to the postanesthesia recovery unit and at the 1st, 6th, and 24th hours postoperatively. However, the rate (P: .007) and the median POST score (P: .046) in the propolis group were significantly lower than that of the other groups at the 2 hours postoperatively. Additionally, throat dryness in the propolis group was significantly lower at the first (P: .046) and second (P: .023) hour after surgery compared to the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative chewing sugar-free gum containing propolis effectively reduces sore throat and throat dryness within the first 2 hours after surgery."

      "abstract": "AIM: Niclosamide is an established anthelmintic substance and a promising candidate for treating cancer, viral infections, and other diseases. However, its solubility in aqueous media is low, and the systemic bioavailability of the commercially available chewing tablet is poor, limiting the use of niclosamide for systemic treatment. A liquid oral formulation using polyethylene glycol 400 was developed and investigated in healthy volunteers to assess safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in comparison to the marketed tablet. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04644705). METHODS: The study consisted of three parts: Part A was a double-blind placebo-controlled single ascending dose trial in three dose groups (200, 600, and 1600 mg) with four participants receiving either the investigational niclosamide formulation or placebo (3:1) under fasted and/or fed conditions. Part B was a crossover study comparing 1600 mg investigational niclosamide solution with the marketed 2000 mg chewing tablet in four healthy volunteers. Part C was a double-blind placebo-controlled multiple-dose trial comparing 1200 mg and 1600 mg (verum: placebo 4:2) in two dose groups with six subjects each, who received daily doses for seven days. RESULTS: No serious or severe adverse events occurred. The most frequent adverse events were mild to moderate gastrointestinal reactions. There was also no apparent dependence between drug exposure levels (AUC, Cmax) and the severity and incidence of adverse events detectable. A relevant food effect was observed with a mean AUClast about 2-fold higher in fed condition compared to fasted condition. In Part B, dose-normalized Cmax and AUClast were similar for niclosamide solution and tablet. Absorption of niclosamide solution was highly variable. Some individuals showed high absorption (Cmax > 2µg/ml) whereas others did absorb only marginally. Importantly, there was no dose linearity in the range of 200 mg - 1600 mg. No signs of relevant systemic drug accumulation after multiple administrations were observed. CONCLUSION: Overall safety and tolerability observed in healthy subjects were benign. This is also true for individuals with high absorption (Cmax > 2µg/ml), encouraging further research into niclosamide as a potential therapeutic agent. Galenic optimization, however, will remain challenging as evident from the observed exposure variability and non-linear PK. Non-linearity, if confirmed by additional data, might make niclosamide more suitable for multi-dose rather than high single dose regimens. The observed food effect should also be considered when further investigating systemic niclosamide exposures. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04644705.",

      "abstract": "This experiment evaluated the effect of α-amylase-enabled corn (AAC) on cows fed ensiled mature kernels at 2 concentrations in the diet. Twenty individually housed Holstein cows, arranged in 4 × 4 Latin squares (with 21-d periods), were exposed to each of 4 treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial combination of corn concentration (C): high corn concentration (High; 28.7% starch, 24.6% corn, 2.5% citrus pulp) versus low corn concentration (Low; 21.5% starch, 14.1% corn, 13.8% citrus pulp) and type (T): AAC (48.8% vitreousness) versus isogenic control (CTL; 51.1% vitreousness). Kernels were ground weekly, hydrated (62.2 ± 1.3% DM on AAC and 63.1 ± 1.4% DM on CTL), and ensiled for 28 ± 3 d. The statistical model had the effects of square, cow (square), period, C, T, and the C × T interaction. No effect of treatment was detected for milk yield (34.1 kg/d) and DMI (22.8 kg/d). High corn reduced the daily yield of fat (1.209 kg/d vs. 1.297 kg/d) and ECM (33.2 kg/d vs. 34.4 kg/d) and increased milk protein concentration (3.12% vs. 3.09%). When fed with Low, AAC increased ECM/DMI relative to CTL (1.54 vs. 1.49). Meal frequency was reduced on High-AAC (9.8 meals/d) relative to Low-AAC (10.3 meals/d). Cows fed High had greater proportion of daily intake in the morning (49.9% vs. 44.4%) and longer duration of the first daily meal (69.7 min vs. 62.0 min) than cows fed Low. There was a tendency for AAC to increase the total-tract NDF digestibility (49.9% vs. 48.0%), but starch digestibility did not differ (98.4%). Ruminal microbial yield did not differ (335 mmol/d of allantoin in urine). High reduced the ruminal acetate to propionate ratio (2.45 vs. 2.95) and pH (6.59 vs. 6.74) relative to Low. Cows fed High-AAC had lower MUN than Low-AAC (17.4 mg/dL vs. 18.8 mg/dL), and plasma urea-N was lower on High-AAC than on High-CTL and Low-AAC (17.2, 19.0, and 18.7 mg/dL, respectively). High starch reduced urine-N excretion (g/d) and partition (% of daily N intake) relative to Low starch and also tended to reduce fecal-N excretion and partition. Overall, Low starch increased milk solids yield, N loss in urine and feces, and the ruminal acetate to propionate ratio. Cows fed AAC and Low had the highest feed efficiency, and cows fed AAC and High had the lowest proportion of N intake in total excreta."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Improved Lithium Disilicate Ceramic has been highly valued in dentistry for over two decades, owing to its durability and aesthetic qualities, making it a preferred choice for both anterior and posterior crowns. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the flexural strength of two types of lithium disilicate blocks post-chewing simulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-six lithium disilicate specimens were utilized in this study. They were divided into two primary groups (n=38) based on two brands: IPS Emax CAD LT (Ivoclar Vivadent) designated as (E), and Initial Lisi LT/B1 (GC America) designated as (L). Each primary group was further split into two subgroups (n=19) based on surface treatment: group E into (E0 & E1) and group L into (L0 & L1). Half of the specimens were subjected to flexural testing without chewing simulation cycles and designated as (E0 and L0), while the remainder were tested after 24×104 cycles of chewing simulation and designated as (E1 and L1). The ceramic surfaces were examined using SEM before and after loading. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Data were gathered, organized, and subjected to Shapiro-Wilk's and Levene's tests (p-value < 0.05), followed by analysis with Brown-Forsythe two-way ANOVA and Tamhane's post hoc tests to assess group differences (p-value <0.05). RESULTS: There were significant statistical differences in the flexural strength values between the different brand groups before and after chewing simulation (p-value < 0.05). The IPS Emax CAD group showed values approximately twice that of the Initial Lisi group (307.2-310.5 MPa ± 48.5-67 vs 148.1-158.5 MPa ± 24.6-25.6). CONCLUSION: Within the limitation of the current study, the following may be concluded: 1. The study's findings suggest that Initial Lisi blocks should not be used for posterior teeth restorations. 2. This study can provide valuable insights for dental professionals to make informed decisions about which material is most appropriate for various clinical situations."

The purpose of this study was to investigate and analyze the severity of masticatory discomfort, stress response, and sleep disturbance in older patients experiencing masticatory discomfort due to tooth loss or temporomandibular disorders (TMD), to find the further treatment direction for these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 392 patients aged 50 years and older with mastication difficulties were analyzed. Two group of patients, those seeking prosthetic treatment due to tooth loss (n = 193) and those who were referred due to TMD-related pain discomfort (n = 199), were identified. Numeric rating scale (NRS), stress response inventory (SRI), and insomnia severity index (ISI) were used as tools to measure patients' subjective chewing discomfort, stress response, and sleep status. RESULTS: Chewing discomfort and age were found to be much higher in the prosthetic group than in the TMD group. The TMD group had significantly higher scores in five SRI parameters (tension, anger, depression, fatigue, and frustration) as well as total score and a higher percentage of clinical insomnia compared to prosthetic patients. CONCLUSION: Since the number of remaining teeth has a significant impact on the masticatory discomfort severity, restoring the occlusion through prosthodontic treatment is important to improve masticatory function. In patients with TMD, it is necessary to assess stress response and sleep quality, and a multidisciplinary treatment approach may be necessary to effectively address masticatory discomfort."

DESIGN: A three-arm randomized controlled trial. METHODS: After a baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned in three groups. The random assignment was performed by using a computer program (Microsoft Excel 2016). Afterward, participants were categorized into three subgroups. Group 3 was the control group that consisted of participants who had no intervention for chewing gum (n = 25). Group 2 was xylitol-free gum chewing group (n = 25), whereas Group 1 was xylitol gum chewing group (n = 24). In later phases, the time to first postsurgical flatus, time to first bowel sound after surgery, time to first postsurgical defecation, time to first mobilization after surgery, and discharge time from hospital were recorded. Nausea and vomiting, which are among the postoperative symptoms, were also evaluated. FINDINGS: The duration of the control group from the end of surgery to the flatulence and bowel sounds was statistically higher than the xylitol group and xylitol-free group (all P < .05). Also, first postoperative flatulence time of xylitol-free group was higher than the xylitol group (P < .05). The duration from the end of surgery to defecation was longer in the control group compared with the xylitol group and the xylitol-free group, with a statistically significant difference between the groups (P < .05). In this study, a statistically significant difference was observed in terms of the time to first postsurgical flatus, time to first bowel sound after surgery, and time to first postsurgical defecation (all P < .000). No significant difference was found between the xylitol group, xylitol-free group, and control group when discharge from hospital and mobilization times were analyzed (all of them are P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Chewing xylitol gum facilitates postoperative gastrointestinal recovery after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Further studies are recommended to confirm these findings and investigate the underlying mechanisms."

This study aimed to evaluate whether the preoperative use of sugar-free chewing gum could effectively minimize the dependence on anti-emetic drugs in women undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery for uterine myomas. METHODS: In this randomized, single-blind study, 92 adult women scheduled for robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery were enrolled. The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a gum-chewing group, which was instructed to chew sugar-free gum for 15 min in the preoperative holding area, or a control group that did not chew gum. The primary outcome was the requirement for anti-emetic medication within the first hour after surgery, when the patient was in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Secondary outcomes included the overall frequency of anti-emetic use. To assess the intervention's effectiveness independent of any other factors, no prophylactic anti-emetics were administered during surgery. RESULTS: Of the 92 participants, 89 completed the study, with 44 assigned to the gum-chewing group and 45 to the control group. The gum-chewing group showed a significantly lower rate of PONV, requiring anti-emetic treatment (79.5%), compared to the control group (95.6%). Additionally, the control group demonstrated a higher overall need for anti-emetic medications. Notably, there were no reported adverse effects, such as jaw discomfort, dental injuries, or gastric regurgitation, in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Chewing sugar-free gum for 15 min prior to surgery was found to be a safe, simple, and effective method to reduce the occurrence of PONV in women undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery for benign uterine tumors. This non-invasive intervention reduced the reliance on anti-emetic drugs and improved patient comfort, without introducing risks. These findings suggest that preoperative gum chewing could be routinely implemented in clinical settings to enhance surgical outcomes."

      "abstract": "AIM: To determine whether unilateral preferent chewing (UPC) affects the position and angulation of the permanent maxillary canine germ on the preferred side. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a retrospective cross-sectional study, medical records from children 7.91(± 0.8) years old with unilateral preferred chewing side and unilateral posterior crossbite were selected. The position of the maxillary canines was analysed by measuring the following angles and distances: the angles formed between the canine axis and the midline (PS; potential impact range > 15°), and that between the canine axis and the bicondylar line (W; potential impact range < 75°). In addition, the canine's position with respect to the lateral incisor (EK; potential impact range > II) and the distance between the canine cusp and the occlusal plane (CCOP potential impact range > 10 mm) were measured. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 106 radiographs; thus, a total of 212 maxillary canines were analysed. Tooth angulation on the preferred chewing side was higher for the angle PS with an average angle of 13.88° (± 7.56) and its position was more frequently found in sector II (49.1%), according to the EK analysis, compared to its contralateral that had an average of 11.75° (± 10.13) for the PS angle and a frequency of 67% in the sector I (p < 0.05 in both analyses). The data obtained for the angle W resulted in an average of 76.12° (± 9.09), while on the contralateral side it was 77.16° (± 12.56; p = 0.012). Lastly, according to the CCOP analysis, the preferred chewing side measured on average 15.3 mm (± 2.4), while on the nonpreferred side it was 15.19 mm (± 2.43; p = 0.143). CONCLUSIONS: Based on this research, UPC seems to have a certain unfavourable influence on canine position and angulation. Thus, this is another factor to consider in decision-making regarding early treatment of this development disorder."

      "abstract": "Chronic use of typical antipsychotics can lead to varying motor effects depending on the timing of analysis. Acute treatment typically induces hypokinesia, resembling parkinsonism, while repeated use can result in tardive dyskinesia, a hyperkinetic syndrome marked by involuntary orofacial movements, such as vacuous chewing movements in mice. Tardive dyskinesia is particularly concerning due to its potential irreversibility and associated motor discomfort. One prevailing theory suggests that tardive dyskinesia arises from hypersensitivity of D2-type dopaminergic receptors caused by continuous blockade from typical antipsychotics like haloperidol. Additionally, increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and elevated FosB protein expression in the dorsolateral striatum are implicated in its pathophysiology. Current treatments for tardive dyskinesia often lack clear efficacy and may lead to significant side effects. Cannabigerol, a non-psychotomimetic cannabinoid with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, has been investigated for its potential antidyskinetic effects. In this study, mice were treated with cannabigerol at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg to evaluate its ability to prevent, ameliorate, or reverse haloperidol-induced vacuous chewing movements. Cannabigerol successfully reduced vacuous chewing movements without affecting normal motor activity, exacerbating haloperidol-induced hypokinesia, or inducing dyskinetic effects on its own. However, no significant reversal of the haloperidol-induced motor effects was observed under the current protocol. Furthermore, cannabigerol did not alter FosB expression or microglia morphology. These findings underscore the need for further research to explore cannabigerol's therapeutic potential and contribute to our understanding of its possible clinical applications in managing tardive dyskinesia.",

However, little is known about their functions in plant defenses against chewing herbivores. Here, we identified a plasma membrane-localized coiled-coil-type NLR protein, OsPik-2-like, whose transcript levels were induced by the infestation of rice leaf folder (LF, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis) larvae, and by treatment with mechanical wounding. Knocking out OsPik-2-like in rice increased the LF-induced levels of jasmonic acid (JA) and jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), the activity of trypsin protease inhibitors (TrypPIs), and the basal levels of some flavonoids, which in turn decreased the performance of LF larvae. Moreover, knocking out OsPik-2-like reduced plant growth. These findings demonstrate that OsPik-2-like regulates the symbiosis between rice and LF by balancing plant growth and defense."

      "abstract": "Dental plaque provides a proper environment for the growth and activity of bacteria responsible for periodontal diseases and caries. As a result, it should be removed by individuals to prevent periodontal diseases and caries. There are different mechanical and chemical plaque control methods. In one study is shown that dental plaque removal efficacy of dentifrice containing Ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid(EDTA)/Methylsulfonylmethane(MSM) was nearly five times that of commercially available fluoride toothpaste. In another study, authors found that xylitol-containing chewing gums caused a marked reduction in the count of Streptococcus Mutans compared to conventional ones. This difference was highly prominent in individuals with poor oral hygiene. In this study we assessed the synergic effects of Xylitol, EDTA and MSM in a chewing gum in comparison with chlorhexidine mouthwash. This study was a crossover, randomized clinical trial. Twenty-four patients were divided in two groups randomly. At the baseline scaling and root planing was done for each patient. Group1 used chlorhexidine mouthwash twice a day. Group2 used novel chewing gum for 15 min twice a day. After 14 days, for every patient O'leary plaque index, gingival index and sulcus bleeding index were reevaluated and recorded. Professional brushing was done for patients. 14 days were considered as wash-out period. After that, method of plaque control of groups was changed. After 14 days, all patients were reevaluated and recorded and were compared with previous data. Samples in 2 groups had no significant difference in age and sex. Paired sample t test revealed that there were significant differences between first and second period for O'leary plaque index, gingival index and sulcus bleeding index in Group1 (P < 0.05). But in Group2 there were no differences between first and second period for all indexes. Also independent sample t test showed that there were no significant differences between baseline, after first treatment and after second one for all indexes in both groups (P > 0.05). According to regression model results, type of treatment had no effect on mean of all indexes. According to our findings which showed the similar efficiency of novel chewing gum and chlorhexidine mouthwash in improving and reducing plaque and gingival indexes, we can conclude that novel chewing gum can be introduced as an effective, cheap and accessible tool for dental plaque control.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maternal periodontal disease is associated with preterm and low-birthweight deliveries, but randomized trials of likely efficacious treatments (e.g., dental scaling and root planing) during pregnancy have not reduced these adverse outcomes. As an alternative, we hypothesized that periconception initiation of xylitol chewing gum would reduce the occurrence of preterm or low-birthweight deliveries among a historical high-prevalence population in Malawi. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, parallel-enrollment, matched-pair, cluster-randomized, controlled clinical trial across eight health centers (sites) in and around Lilongwe, Malawi. Sites were paired by anticipated delivery volume and randomized to prenatal and oral health education alone (active control) or with twice-daily xylitol chewing gum (intervention) throughout the periconception and antenatal periods. For the primary prevention of preterm (<37 weeks) and low-birthweight (<2,500 g) deliveries (co-primary outcomes), comparison by allocation group was performed using generalized linear mixed models for each outcome as a fixed factor and the site(s) as a random factor. FINDINGS: 10,069 participants were enrolled (n = 4,549 at intervention sites, n = 5,520 at active control sites), with >95% available for analyses. Initiation of xylitol chewing gum resulted in significant reductions in the co-primary outcomes: preterm birth (12.6% [549/4,349] vs. 16.5% [878/5,321]; relative risk [RR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-0.99) and <2,500-g neonates (8.9% [385/4,305] vs. 12.9% [679/5,260]; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49-0.99). Xylitol chewing gum use also led to fewer neonatal demises (0.2% [8/4,305] vs. 0.4% [22/5,260]; RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.89). CONCLUSIONS: Periconception initiation and ongoing use of xylitol chewing gum significantly reduced the occurrence of preterm and low-birthweight deliveries in Malawi. FUNDING: E.W.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four subjects with no abnormalities in the maxillofacial region and oral functions were enrolled in this study. Relationships between angles between the reference plane (Frankfort horizontal plane, Camper's plane, and occlusal plane) and masticatory performance, occlusal force, and occlusal contact area by chewing side were examined. Regarding the measurement of reference planes, a creatively modified three-plane measuring device was used to measure angles between the reference planes. Images were taken from the right and left sides and angles between reference planes were measured. Masticatory performance was examined by measuring the amount of glucose extracted from a gummy jelly on the habitual and non-habitual chewing sides separately. Occlusal force and occlusal contact area were measured by occluding against pressure-sensitive film, and values on the habitual and non-habitual chewing sides were calculated and analyzed. RESULTS: The angle between Camper's plane and the occlusal plane correlated with masticatory performance on both the habitual chewing side (r = 0.47, P < .01) and the non-habitual chewing side (r = 0.36, P < .05). A correlation was observed between masticatory performance and occlusal force on the habitual chewing side (r = 0.46, P < .01). CONCLUSION: Masticatory performance became higher as occlusal plane inclination increased. This result represents essential knowledge for prosthetic treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clear thermoplastic materials are used in a variety of oral appliances. In some situations, patients may wear clear thermoplastic appliances while eating. However, the effect of wearing clear thermoplastic appliances on chewing efficiency is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the differences in masticatory function between chewing with and without wearing clear thermoplastic retainers over a 6-month period, and its associated factors. METHODS: Thirty patients who received upper and lower clear retainers after debonding fixed appliances were examined for objective and subjective masticatory function at retainer delivery (T0), 3-month (T1), and 6-month follow-ups (T2) in two conditions: with and without wearing their retainers while chewing. The objective method used multiple sieves reported as the median particle size (MPS). The food intake ability (FIA) test served as the subjective method. Paired t-test was used to compare the outcomes between chewing with and without retainers at each evaluation time point. Repeated measures ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post-hoc test was used to compare the outcomes between the three evaluating time points. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to assess whether age, sex, and extraction/non-extraction was associated with these effects. RESULTS: The MPS was significantly greater when chewing with retainers compared with chewing without them at T0 (P < 0.05), however, it was not significantly greater at T1 and T2 (P > 0.05). The MPS with and without the retainers tend to decrease between T0, T1 and T2. In particular, the MPS while chewing with retainers significantly decreased between T0 and T1. The total FIA score and FIA subscores for hard and soft food were significantly lower when eating with retainers at T0 (P < 0.05), however, all FIA scores when eating without retainers did not significantly change between T0, T1, and T2. No significantly associated factors were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Wearing clear retainers while chewing decreases objective and subjective masticatory function immediately after completing orthodontic treatment. However, this significantly improved to levels comparable to chewing without retainers after a 3-month follow-up. Age, sex, and extraction/non-extraction treatment were not associated with the difference in masticatory function while chewing with and without wearing the retainers.",

The aim was to compare a new treatment, chewing gum, with a widely used intravenous agent, ondansetron, to treat postoperative nausea and vomiting in female patients in the postanesthesia care unit. METHODS: This study was a multicenter, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial in 17 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. Female patients aged 12 yr or older undergoing volatile anesthetic-based general anesthesia for laparoscopic or breast surgery were enrolled. Protocolized antiemetic prophylaxis was administered. Patients who developed postoperative nausea and vomiting in the postanesthesia care unit were randomized to either 15 min of chewing gum or 4 mg intravenous ondansetron. The primary outcome was cessation of nausea, retching, or vomiting with no recurrence nor rescue medication for 2 h after administration of the randomized intervention ( i.e. , complete response). RESULTS: Of 865 enrolled patients, 218 were randomized. In a per-protocol analysis, 50 of 105 (47.6%) ondansetron-treated patients compared with 31 of 103 (30.1%) chewing gum-treated patients achieved the primary outcome (absolute risk difference [95% CI], -17.3 [-30.4 to -4.3]%), not reaching the prespecified noninferiority limit. The time to complete response was longer for patients randomized to chewing gum (hazard ratio [95% CI], 0.53 [0.34 to 0.83]), and they were more likely to receive antiemetics in the 24 h after surgery (absolute risk difference [95% CI], 14.1 [1.6 to 26.5]%). CONCLUSIONS: Chewing gum cannot be recommended as an alternative to ondansetron for treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting in female patients administered antiemetic prophylaxis.",

      "abstract": "Past studies have shown that isoacids (ISO) improve dairy cow performance, with effects varying based on dietary forage levels, leading us to speculate that ISO supplementation may also differentially affect enteric methane (CH4) emissions depending on dietary forage levels. Therefore, our primary objective was to examine the effects of ISO supplementation on enteric CH4 emissions in lactating dairy cows fed 2 forage NDF levels (FL), along with monitoring feed particle sorting and chewing behaviors to assess any potential interactions. Sixty-four mid-lactation Holstein cows were used in a 10-wk long randomized complete block design trial. Parity, DIM, and prior milk yield (MY) for multiparous cows or genetic merit for primiparous cows were used as blocking factors. Cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 diets (n = 16 per diet) with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatment combinations, including 2 FL, 17% (LF) and 21% forage NDF (HF), without or with ISO supplementation (7.85 mmol/kg DM for isobutyrate and 3.44 mmol/kg DM for 2-methylbutyrate, respectively). Enteric CH4 and chewing activity (rumination and eating time) were measured using the GreenFeed system and sensor-based ear tag system, respectively. The particle size of each diet and ort from individual cows was measured using the Penn State Particle Separator, and a sorting index was calculated. A sorting index of 100 indicates no sorting, whereas values above or below 100 indicate sorting for or against, respectively. Data were analyzed using a mixed model including FL, ISO, and FL × ISO as fixed effects and block as a random effect (lme4 in R). Our result shows that ISO increased sorting index for long particle in LF (96.1 vs. 109; P < 0.01) but decreased it in HF (100.8 vs. 92.5; P = 0.04). In contrast, ISO did not affect the physically effective particle sorting index (P = 0.51) or intake (P = 0.27) regardless of FL. In alignment with the long particle sorting index, ISO decreased eating and chewing time in the HF but increased them in the LF diet (P < 0.01). In contrast, rumination time was comparable between FL (P = 0.70) and ISO levels (P = 0.19). In the LF diet, ISO supplementation reduced daily CH4 production (g/d) by 9% and intensity (g/kg of MY) by 18% (P < 0.01). In the HF diet, ISO supplementation led to a 10% increase in daily CH4 (P < 0.01) but did not change CH4 intensity (P = 0.17; g/kg of MY) due to improved milk production. Overall, ISO altered feed sorting, feeding behaviors and enteric CH4 emissions depending on FL.",

METHODS: This multicenter, prospective, double-blind, two-arm parallel-group randomized controlled trial involving 160 patients was conducted for a period of 9 months. The patients were classified into the study (TC patients) and control (NTC patients) groups, which were subdivided into two subgroups 1 hour before the procedure based on oral premedication with tab ibuprofen 600 mg. Nicotine dependence was assessed using the Modified Fagerstrom Tolerance Nicotine Scale. Patients were administered an IANB injection of 2% lignocaine containing epinephrine 1:100000 after premedication. Pulpal anesthesia before NEI was confirmed using electric pulp testing and cold spraying. Patients rated their pain on the 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) during NEI thrice at the dentin, pulp, and instrumentation levels. No pain at each level indicated the success of anesthesia. RESULTS: The success and failure rates did not differ between the premedication and non-premedication subgroups in the TC or NTC groups (P > 0.05). However, the success rate was higher in the premedication subgroup of the NTC group (52.5%) than in the TC group (45%). Most patients with premedication experienced failure at the instrumentation level, whereas patients in the non-premedication group experienced pain at the dentin level. Failure rates of IANB did not differ significantly at different levels between the groups (P > 0.05). The mean VAS scores differed significantly at the dentin level in both groups, with lower values in the premedication group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of ibuprofen premedication with IANB during NEI did not differ significantly between the TC and NTC patients with SIP. The effect of premedication was more significant in the NTC group than in the TC group. A causal relationship between nicotine consumption and the success of premedication could not be established, and further studies are required to validate the results of the present study."

      "abstract": "Gum chewing is used in orofacial therapy to improve oral functions, such as a patient's chewing ability, bite force, tongue pressure, and lip closure strength. However, its effects on masseter muscle oxygen dynamics and muscle activity may vary with the hardness and features of the gum base. Therefore, when considering gum chewing for therapeutic purposes, it is essential to select gum of an appropriate hardness. This study aimed to elucidate the impact of gum hardness differences on masseter muscle tissue oxygen dynamics and muscle activity. We conducted a 120-s gum chewing study using three types of gum with different hardness levels on 11 healthy adult males. Each patient's masseter muscle tissue oxygen dynamics, muscle activity, and heart rate were measured, and the extent of masseter fatigue was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Per our findings, as gum hardness increased, significant reductions in oxygen saturation (StO2) and significant increases in deoxyhaemoglobin (Deoxy-Hb) concentrations were observed in masseter muscle tissue oxygen dynamics. Likewise, muscle activity, heart rate, and muscle fatigue (according to VAS) also increased significantly as gum hardness increased. The findings of this study reveal that increasing gum base hardness not only affects masseter muscle tissue oxygen dynamics but also increases muscle activity, masseter fatigue, and heart rate. When selecting gum for orofacial therapy involving gum chewing exercises, it is crucial to choose the appropriate gum.",

Fourteen national-level (age: 25.2 ± 5.4; height: 176.5 ± 5.3; weight: 78.1 ± 13.4) ice hockey players were tested late at night after a full day awake schedule with jet lag. A randomised, double-blind experimental design was employed in which participants either chewed caffeinated gum (CAF) containing 3 mg/kg caffeine or a caffeine-free placebo gum (PLA) for 10 min prior to undertaking a series of on-ice and off-ice tests. The off-ice tests included grip force, the counter-movement jump (CMJ), and the squat jump (SJ). The on-ice tests included a 35 m sprint, the S-Shape agility test, and the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test (Yo-Yo IR1 test). The CMJ height (CAF: 47.2 ± 4.4; PL: 45.9 ± 3.5; p = 0.035; Cohen's d = 0.32) and SJ height (CAF: 46.7 ± 4.1; PL: 44.9 ± 3.8; p = 0.047; Cohen's d = 0.44) were found to be significantly higher in the CAF than in the PL trial. However, there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in grip force, as well as in the 35 m sprint, the S-Shape agility test, and the Yo-Yo IR1 test. The present study found that, following a jet lag intervention, although the consumption of caffeinated gum resulted in an increase in vertical jump height, it had no impact on performance in the ice tests. The results of this study may help coaches and athletes consider the need for caffeine supplementation when experiencing jet lag.",

Traditional interventions targeting slower eating rates often concentrate on chewing behavior, leaving the impact of ME largely unexplored. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the ME program in improving eating rates and mindful eating compared to conventional education centered solely on chewing. METHODS: A total of 66 women university students were randomly assigned to either the ME (n = 33) or chewing intervention groups (n = 33). Education programs were delivered via smartphones over 8 weeks, with bi-weekly sessions where participants watched videos individually. The primary outcome was the eating rate, while the secondary outcome were eating style and the Mindful Eating Questionnaire (MEQ) assessed through web-based questionnaires. Measurements were taken pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at 1 and 3 months follow-up. Statistical analysis was conducted using intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: Both the ME and chewing groups showed slower eating rates compared to baseline, indicating the effect's temporal persistence, with no significant differences found between them at the end of the intervention and at 1 and 3 months post-intervention. In addition, the ME group significantly increased the MEQ scores compared to the chewing group. CONCLUSION: The educational program using ME reduced the rate of eating and achieved results similar to those of programs focused solely on chewing. Furthermore, it was effective in increasing MEQ scores. Based on these findings, a comprehensive education program that focuses on ME is recommended.",

This study evaluates the impact of a structured teaching program on knowledge regarding the ill effects of tobacco chewing among adults enrolled in arts and commerce colleges in Patan, India. A quasi-experimental design was employed, with 100 participants recruited from arts and commerce colleges. The structured teaching program included educational sessions covering the harmful effects of tobacco chewing and cessation strategies. Pre and post-test knowledge assessments were conducted using a self-structured questionnaire. The majority of participants were aged 15-17 years (75%), male (75%), and from urban areas (58.33%). Significant improvements in knowledge scores were observed following the intervention (pretest mean score = 11.5, posttest mean score = 44.38), with a significant difference between pre and post-test scores (t = 11.38, p < 0.001). Associations between pre-test knowledge scores and demographic variables such as gender, education, type of family, area of residence, father's education and occupation, monthly income, history of illness, and previous knowledge were identified (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The study underscores the significance of targeted health education programs in addressing tobacco-related health risks and promoting public health. By enhancing awareness and knowledge among adults, such interventions contribute to fostering behavior change and reducing the burden of tobacco-related diseases."

      "abstract": "Identifying the cause of death in road traffic incidents and the contributing factors is crucial for forensic investigations, public health research, and epidemiological studies. In this case, the discovery of chewing gum in the larynx during an autopsy complicated the forensic diagnostic process and challenged the determination of the primary cause of death. Our case report details a 53-year-old male driver involved in a fatal road traffic accident. First responders found him unconscious and unresponsive. Despite resuscitative efforts, including endotracheal intubation, he could not be revived. The autopsy revealed multiple blunt force injuries from the collision and chewing gum in the larynx. The gum may have been aspirated while driving, potentially causing choking, severe coughing, or reflex cardiac arrest, which could have led to sudden incapacitation and the accident. Alternatively, the gum might have been overlooked during intubation, possibly pushing it deeper into the airway and creating an iatrogenic artifact. The cause of death was attributed to multiple blunt force injuries, specifically head trauma. However, the possibility of foreign body aspiration leading to the accident or the gum being an iatrogenic artifact cannot be ruled out. This case report highlights the potential impact of airway foreign bodies on road accidents and the risk of iatrogenic artifacts during resuscitation. It underscores the importance of thorough airway evaluation, prompt recognition of potential obstructions, and accurate documentation in prehospital settings to prevent worsening obstructions, misdiagnoses, delays in diagnosis, and complications in future cases."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized, open-label crossover study conducted at the University of Tokyo Hospital, overweight/obese Japanese male participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to start the study with consumption of either UPFs or non-UPFs for 1 week, followed by a 2-week washout period, before crossing over to the alternate food diet for 1 week. Individuals with diabetes, hypertension or any other medical conditions who visited a hospital regularly were excluded. The meals were designed to be matched for the total energy and macronutrient levels. The primary outcome was the difference in the body weight change between the UPF and non-UPF periods. The differences in the average daily energy intake and chewing frequency were assessed as one of the prespecified secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Nine eligible participants were randomly assigned to start the study with either UPFs or non-UPFs. All participants completed the study. During the UPF period, participants gained 1.1 kg more weight (95% confidence interval 0.2 to 2.0; P = .021) and consumed 813.5 kcal more per day (342.4 to 1284.7; P = .0041) compared with during the non-UPF period. Regarding the chewing frequency, the number of chews per calorie was significantly lower during the UPF period (P = .016). CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of UPFs causes significant weight gain. Medical nutritional therapy focused on reducing the consumption of UPFs could be an effective strategy for preventing obesity.",

Our study investigated the association of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), histamine, diamine oxidase (DAO), thyroxine and pyridoxine and the severity of NVP symptoms and assessed the efficacy of a vitamin C-containing chewing gum as a potential NVP treatment. Methods: In this prospective, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, 111 participants were assigned to receive vitamin C-containing chewing gum, placebo gum, or no treatment at two follow-ups during early pregnancy. Maternal serum levels of hCG, histamine, DAO, thyroxine, and pyridoxine were measured and correlated with NVP severity using the Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis and Nausea (PUQE-24) score. Results: Elevated maternal hCG levels were significantly associated with an increased PUQE-24 score (p < 0.001), while histamine levels showed no significant correlation (p = 0.68). Maternal DAO levels negatively correlated with NVP symptoms (p < 0.001) and elevated thyroxine (p < 0.001) and pyridoxine levels (p < 0.001) were associated with increased PUQE-24 scores. The vitamin C-containing chewing gum did not demonstrate efficacy in alleviating NVP symptoms compared to placebo gum or no treatment during the first (p = 0.62) and second follow-up visits (p = 0.87). Conclusions: Our study underscores the complexity of factors contributing to NVP, highlighting the significant roles of hCG and DAO, while histamine levels appear unrelated. Maternal thyroxine and pyridoxine levels also significantly correlate with NVP symptoms. Vitamin C-containing chewing gum was not effective as a treatment for NVP. Further large-scale studies are needed to better understand these interactions and develop targeted treatments in the future."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chewing gum is a healthy, cheap, and familiar solution for patients with premature irritation of the stomach and intestines. This study compared the effect of chewing gum and the routine method on ileus after burns. METHODS: This study is a randomized clinical trial conducted in Valiasr Hospital in Arak, Markazi Province, in the center of Iran, from December 2021 to February 2023. After the diagnosis of intestinal ileus in 83 patients hospitalized in the burn department by a general surgeon, with the available sampling method, these patients were evaluated based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study. As a result, 66 patients were selected and divided into groups A (33 patients in the intervention group: routine care + gum chewing) and B (33 patients in the control group: routine care) by random allocation method. For the intervention group, from entering the ward until the beginning of oral feeding, gum (without sugar) was chewed four times a day for 15 min, while control groups received the routine diet of the department. Both groups' condition of the bowel sounds, time of passing gas, and stool were recorded. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 16. The chi-squared, Fisher's exact, Independent t-test, and Mann-Whitney U tests were utilized. RESULTS: The results showed that the median bowel sound return time, time of the first gas discharge, earliest defecation time, and time to start the diet were significantly shorter in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study showed the effect of chewing gum without sugar in shortening the symptoms of intestinal ileus after burns. However, it was not effective in reducing the hospitalization period of patients. According to these results, it is recommended to add chewing gum to the routine care of people hospitalized due to burns.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The present study sought to assess the prevalence and determinants of tobacco use (cigarette smoking and shisha use) and khat chewing among Yemeni adolescents, and to evaluate their knowledge and attitudes toward these habits. METHODS: This school-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 13 to 19-year-old students attending middle/high schools (both private and public) across five main cities in Yemen. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires comprising questions/items related to sociodemographic data, cigarette smoking, shisha use, khat chewing, and knowledge on and attitudes toward these habits. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to explore the most determinant factors. RESULTS: A total of 7505 students were recruited from 42 schools across five major cities in Yemen. The prevalence rates of khat chewing, cigarette smoking, and shisha use were 42.4%, 6.8%, and 19.3%, respectively. Compared to females, male subjects reported significantly higher prevalence of khat chewing (51.4% vs. 23.5%, p < 0.001), shisha use (20.3% vs. 17.2%, p < 0.01), and cigarette smoking (8.8% vs. 2.6%, p < 0.001). Male gender, older age, poor knowledge, khat chewing, parents' low education level, and parents' and peers' smoking habits were significant determinants of adolescents' cigarette smoking status. Private education, male gender, older age, poor knowledge, parents' low education level, and parents' and peers' khat chewing habits were significant determinants of adolescents' khat chewing status. The participant's knowledge of and attitudes toward tobacco use and khat chewing were inadequate. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of khat chewing, shisha use, and to lesser extent cigarette smoking among Yemeni adolescents is high that needs immediate intervention. The results highlight the urgent need to implement prevention strategies to tackle these habits among the youth in Yemen.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common issue for females undergoing gynecological surgeries, including those assisted by robotic systems. Despite available prophylactic measures, the incidence of PONV remains high, negatively impacting recovery and increasing healthcare costs. This study evaluates whether preoperative gum chewing reduces the need for anti-emetic drugs in females undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery for benign ovarian mass. Materials and Methods: This prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial enrolled 92 adult females scheduled for robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery to treat benign ovarian mass. Following exclusions, the remaining participants were randomly assigned to either a gum-chewing group or a no-gum-chewing group. The gum-chewing group chewed sugar-free gum for 15 min in the holding area before surgery. The primary outcome measured was the need for anti-emetics to control PONV during the first hour in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Secondary outcomes included the number of anti-emetic requests. No preemptive anti-emetics were administered during surgery. Results: Out of the initial 92 patients, 88 were included in the final analysis, with 44 in each group. The incidence of PONV requiring anti-emetics in the PACU was significantly lower in the gum-chewing group (79.5%) compared to the no-gum-chewing group (95.5%). Additionally, the number of anti-emetic requests was higher in the no-gum-chewing group. No postoperative complications such as tooth or jaw pain/injury or gastric content regurgitation were reported. Conclusions: Preoperative gum chewing for 15 min immediately before surgery significantly reduced the incidence of PONV in females undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery for benign ovarian mass. This simple, non-pharmacological intervention improved patient comfort and reduced the need for anti-emetic medications without any adverse effects. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to develop guidelines for incorporating preoperative gum chewing into clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy (RT) has numerous effects on the oral mucosa, primarily genetic alterations and changes in the microenvironment. The characteristics of oral leukoplakia (OL) may differ between patients who have received previous head and neck cancer (HNC) treatment with radiation therapy and those who have not. Due to a lack of data on this scenario, we aimed to investigate the surgical outcomes of OL by comparing these two patient groups. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study enrolled a total of 224 OL lesions in 124 patients who underwent carbon dioxide laser (CO2 laser) surgery from July 2002 to Aug 2021. All patients had received previous treatments for HNC, with 59 patients undergoing only surgical approach, 65 patients undergoing RT, and 46 patients undergoing concurrent chemotherapy during RT. The analysis was performed on a per-lesion basis, not a per-capita basis. We investigated the associations of clinicopathological characteristics and treatment outcomes of OL lesions that developed from irradiated or nonirradiated oral mucosa. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 5.87 years. Postoperative recurrence of OL occurred in 30 patients. Malignant transformation occurred in 17 patients with the incidence rate 4.19% annually and 13.7% cumulatively. The average time for OL transforming into squamous cell carcinoma was 3.27 ± 3.26 years (median 1.82, range 0.11 - 11.90). In univariate analysis, non-homogeneous morphology (P = 0.042), moderate to high-grade dysplasia (P = 0.041), and nonirradiated oral mucosa (P = 0.0047) were predictors for malignant transformation. However, in the Cox proportional hazard model, only nonirradiated oral mucosa remained an independent prognostic factor related to postoperative malignant transformation of OL (P = 0.031, HR 5.08, CI95 1.16 - 22.25). CONCLUSION: In the population whose OL is strongly aetiologically linked to environmental carcinogens such as betel nut and tobacco, OL lesions that develop on previously irradiated oral mucosa have a lower risk for postoperative malignant transformation compared to those that develop on nonirradiated mucosa. This finding highlights the potential impacts of radiation on OL. Further research is needed to confirm this observation and elucidate the underlying mechanism.",

DESIGN: A prospective, single-centre, two-arm, parallel, double-blinded randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Orthodontic unit of a privately funded hospital, Chennai, India. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 28 participants were randomly allocated into a chewing gum group (CGG) (n = 14) or a control group (CG) (n = 14). METHODS: Baseline data were collected at the start of retraction (T0), at 4 weeks (T1), 8 weeks (T2) and 12 weeks (T3) after the start of retraction. Rate of space closure, pain, oral hygiene and appliance breakage were assessed at T1, T2 and T3. Data were analysed using an independent t-test with P < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean rate of space closure in the CGG was 0.9 ± 0.2 mm/month and 0.8 ± 0.2 mm/month in the CG (mean difference 0.1mm/month ± 0.16; 95% confidence interval -0.055-0.26). In both the groups, oral hygiene became worse between T0 and T3. At T0 and T1, participants in the CGG reported less pain at 24 h and 7 days when compared to the CG (P < 0.05). At T2 and T3, participants in the CGG reported less pain at 0 h, 24 h and 7 days when compared to the CG (P < 0.05). Appliance breakage in both groups was minimal, with an odds ratio of 0.7 (95% CI 0.1-3.8) and was similar (P = 0.66). CONCLUSION: There was a minimal increase that was clinically not significant in the rate of space closure with chewing gum. Chewing gum ensured better oral hygiene, helped alleviate pain and had no effect on appliance breakage during space closure.",

Additionally, this study evaluated the effect of non-pharmacological pain control methods on the frequency of separators falling out. METHODS: The study sample comprised 105 female patients between 15 and 35 years of age. The patients were randomly selected and classified into three groups (35 each). Each group was given either ibuprofen, viscoelastic bite wafers, or chewing gum immediately after the placement of separators and every 8 h for 1 week, as needed. The patients were asked to record their pain perception using a visual analog scale following separator placement at 2 h, 6 h, bedtime, 24 h, and at 2, 3, and 7 days. Analysis of variance testing was used for the data analysis. RESULTS: Among the three studied groups, there were no significant differences in pain perception at any time point. The patients experienced significantly higher pain scores at bedtime and 24 h after separator placement. In addition, there were statistically significant findings in pain perception at different time points within each pain relief method (p = 0.000, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The use of chewing gum and bite wafers in alleviating orthodontic pain was beneficial and comparable to ibuprofen use following the placement of separators before orthodontic treatment among orthodontic patients."

We present the unique case of a patient who developed a chewing compulsion when taking mixed amphetamine salts (MAS). A 32-year-old female patient with a past medical history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastroparesis, and migraines was seen for initial psychiatric assessment due to concerns for irritability. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); generalized anxiety disorder; ADHD, inattentive type; and unspecified bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine was started and titrated to 25mg twice per day, with improved mood stability. MAS immediate-release (IR) was started at 2.5mg and titrated to 5mg daily for ADHD. She then experienced an uncontrollable urge to chew, finding relief when chewing on a child's teething necklace, which provided satisfaction and a reduction in anxiety. She denied jaw tightness or teeth grinding. The dose of MAS IR was reduced to 2.5mg daily with improvement in symptoms and later increased again to 5mg daily, which she was then able to tolerate. Stereotyped biting behaviors have been observed in rats with the use of amphetamines, and the onset of compulsive behavior has emerged in children with the use of dextroamphetamine. However, this is the first known case of compulsive chewing or biting movements reported in humans with MAS use. This case highlights the need to assess patients for adverse events, such as compulsive biting and chewing movements or other oral facial stereotypies, after commencement of stimulants, including MAS."

In this study, we compared brain blood flow (BBF) in patients with OPEN and NORM and investigated the factors related to BBF during mastication in patients with OPEN. The study included 17 individuals with NORM and 33 patients with OPEN. The following data were collected: number of occlusal contacts, jaw movement variables during mastication, and BBF measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy during chewing. The number of occlusal contacts, maximum closing and opening speeds, closing angle, and vertical amplitude were smaller in the OPEN than in the NORM group. Interestingly, BBF increased less in the OPEN group. Correlation analysis revealed that several parameters, including number of occlusal contacts and closing angle, were correlated with changes in BBF during mastication. These results suggest that not only occlusion but also jaw movement variables and factors related to masticatory muscles contribute to the chewing-related increase in BBF. In conclusion, BBF increases less during mastication in patients with OPEN than in those with NORM. In addition, the higher increase in BBF is correlated with jaw movement. Together, we discovered that OPEN exhibits significant adverse effects not only on masticatory function but also on brain function."

      "abstract": "Mastication is the initial phase of digestion and is crucial to equine health due to its role in saliva production and food particle reduction. Hay nets have been promoted to slow the rate of hay consumption, with many styles of slow feeders available. Limited research has shown that nets may slow consumption, but no research has examined their effect on the horse's chewing frequency and patterns. The objective of this study was to compare chew frequency (CF, total number of chews/kg consumed) and chew duration (CD, total minutes chewed/kg consumed), as well as distribution of chews over a feeding period, of horses eating bermudagrass hay in three styles of hay nets [large mesh (LM), small mesh (SM), bottom hole (BH)] as compared to a control of loose hay (CTL). Treatments were assigned in a replicated Latin square 4 × 4 using eight horses. Horses were given a 24-hr acclimation period prior to recording their chewing patterns over a 24-hr period using an automated halter fit with a pressure-sensor noseband. Results indicate that CF was not influenced by treatment. However, SM resulted in longer CD as compared to CTL (P = 0.007). Additionally, BH resulted in a higher percentage of chews completed in the first 240 min compared to SM (P = 0.039), indicating more rapid consumption. Results of this study indicate hay nets may not influence the number of chews a horse performs while masticating hay, but small mesh feeders may increase the CD and reduce early consumption rate.",

The study's objective was to assess the effects of four distinct treatment approaches on temporomandibular disorder cases with anterior disc displacements focusing on their chewing efficiency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred participants suffering from reducible TMJ disc displacement were selected for enrollment in the study. Subjects were divided equally into four groups: group I patients were treated with behavioral therapy; group II patients were treated with low-level laser therapy (LLLT); group III patients were treated with anterior repositioning splints; and group IV patients were treated with flat plane splints. Chewing efficiency was assessed utilizing the fractional sieving method and a synthetic food substitute was created using silicon impression material. The statistical analysis encompassed comparisons of chewing efficiency between groups and between baseline and posttreatment within each group, employing analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired t tests, respectively. RESULTS: Using the paired t test, a significant difference in chewing efficiency values as expressed by the median particle size was observed between the baseline and 6-month values in all groups (P < 0.05), except for group I where no significant change was noted over the 6 months (P > 0.05). The one-way ANOVA test revealed a statistically significant difference among groups following therapies (P ˂ 0.05). The post hoc Tukey test was employed for pairwise comparisons and revealed statistically significant variances in the main values of chewing efficiency among all groups at a 95% confidence level (P ˂ 0.05). CONCLUSION: The study's results suggest that occlusal splints and LLLT are more effective in improving chewing efficiency than behavioral interventions."

The study's robust findings reaffirm the viability of MDI-retained RPDs as a treatment modality in contemporary prosthodontics, instilling confidence in the dental community. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 92 participants with posterior edentulism in the maxilla or mandible received 184 MDIs and 92 RPDs. After one year, three participants were excluded, and another seven were excluded after three years. The final sample was 82 participants. Self-perceived orofacial esthetics was assessed by the Orofacial Esthetic Scale (OES), chewing function by the Chewing Function Questionnaire (CFQ), and the OHRQoL by the OHIP-14. Statistical analysis utilized multivariate regression analysis, standardized effect size calculation, Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, and Friedman's test. RESULTS: OHRQoL and chewing function significantly improved (p < 0.001) one month after MDI loading by the new RPDs and continued to improve over the observation period (p < 0.05). The OES also significantly improved (p < 0.001) and remained almost unchanged over the next three years (p = 0.440). CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations of this study, the MDI-retained RPD appears to be a viable treatment modality in contemporary prosthodontics from the patients' perspective.",

Reference lists of relevant systematic reviews were hand searched for other eligible studies for inclusion. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled clinical trials and controlled clinical trials conducted on children (aged ≤ 18 years), conducted between 1974-2022 and available in English, were eligible for inclusion. Studies were excluded if caries was not an outcome, the control group was not sufficient, they were lab-based studies or studies where xylitol delivery was not a sweet or chewing gum and where the xylitol product contained a component such as fluoride which may influence the outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Four calibrated reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, and disagreements were resolved via group discussion. Preventative effect was determined by comparing the mean caries increment in the control and intervention groups, producing a preventative fraction. A total of 617 titles were initially screened for relevance. After duplicate removal, 268 abstracts were screened and 16 full text articles reviewed, with one more study then excluded. 10 studies investigated xylitol-containing chewing gum, and six looked at xylitol candy (one did both). Eight included studies were randomised controlled trials. Data extraction was undertaken by two reviewers. RESULTS: 3466 participants were included in the 10 studies that investigated xylitol chewing gum, and all 10 studies reported a statistically significant preventive effect compared to a no chewing gum or placebo control. In 9 studies, the preventive fraction was clinically significant. The six studies investigating xylitol candies contained a total of 1023 participants, and only one study demonstrated a significant preventative effect. CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that incorporating xylitol chewing gum daily has a caries-reducing effect in those with a moderate-to-high baseline caries level. This effect was not present for xylitol sweets.",

This study aimed to investigate the association between self-perception of chewing, chewing behavior, and the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms in preoperative patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Sixty adult candidates for bariatric surgery at a public hospital in Belém (Brazil) were analyzed. Participants predominantly exhibited unilateral chewing patterns (91.6%), a fast chewing rhythm (73.3%), a large food bolus (80%), liquid intake during meals (36.7%), and 41.7% reported that chewing could cause some issue. Significant associations were found between the perception of causing problems and chewing scarcity (p = 0.006), diarrhea (p = 0.004), absence of slow chewing (p = 0.048), and frequent cutting of food with front teeth (p = 0.034). These findings reveal a relationship between the perception of chewing problems and chewing scarcity, presence of diarrhea, and fast chewing.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Chewing gums containing antiseptics or other antimicrobial substances may be effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis. Therefore, the aim of this randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was to investigate the efficacy of a novel antimicrobial chewing gum containing essential oils (cinnamon, lemon, peppermint) and extracts on reduction of dental plaque and gingivitis as well as on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in adolescent orthodontic patients. MATERIALS: 52 patients (11-22 years of age) were randomly assigned to use a test chewing gum (COVIDGUM, Clevergum) or a commercially available control chewing gum over a period of 10 days. Approximal plaque index (API), papillary bleeding index (PBI) and an OHRQoL questionnaire for children (COHIP-G19) were assessed at baseline (BL), after 10 days (10d) and 30 days (30d). In addition, oral health and oral hygiene related questions of the COHIP-G19 questionnaire were evaluated separately in subscales at each timepoint. Data were analyzed using non-parametrical statistical procedures (α = 0.05). RESULTS: API and PBI decreased significantly over time from BL to 10d and from BL to 30d in both groups, without significant differences between the groups. In both groups, the COHIP-G19 score, oral health subscale and oral hygiene subscale decreased significantly over time. Regarding the oral hygiene subscale, the test group showed significantly better scores at 30d (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Both chewing gums performed similarly effective in terms of reducing plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation and improving OHRQoL. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Chewing gums without antimicrobial ingredients may be sufficient to decrease plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation.",

      "abstract": "In infants and children with feeding and swallowing issues, modifying solid foods to form a liquid or puree is used to ensure adequate growth and nutrition. However, the behavioral and neurophysiological effects of prolonged use of this intervention during critical periods of postnatal oral skill development have not been systematically examined, although substantial anecdotal evidence suggests that it negatively impacts downstream feeding motor and coordination skills, possibly due to immature sensorimotor development. Using an established animal model for infant and juvenile feeding physiology, we leverage X-ray reconstruction of moving morphology to compare feeding behavior and kinematics between 12-week-old pigs reared on solid chow (control) and an age- and sex-matched cohort raised on the same chow softened to a liquid. When feeding on two novel foods, almond and apple, maintenance on a soft diet decreases gape cycle duration, resulting in a higher chewing frequency. When feeding on almonds, pigs in this group spent less time ingesting foods compared to controls, and chewing cycles were characterized by less jaw rotation about a dorsoventral axis (yaw) necessary for food reduction. There was also a reduced tendency to alternate chewing side with every chew during almond chewing, a behavioral pattern typical of pigs. These more pronounced impacts on behavior and kinematics during feeding on almonds, a tougher and stiffer food than apples, suggest that food properties mediate the behavioral and physiological impacts of early texture modification and that the ability to adapt to different food properties may be underdeveloped. In contrast, the limited effects of food texture modification on apple chewing indicate that such intervention/treatment does not alter feeding behavior of less challenging foods. Observed differences cannot be attributed to morphology because texture modification over the treatment period had limited impact on craniodental growth. Short-term impacts of soft-texture modification during postweaning development on feeding dynamics should be considered as potential negative outcomes of this treatment strategy.",

The accuracy of drug delivery is very important to achieve a successful therapeutic effect in the case of various pharmaceutical products. A novel drug delivery system adds new benefits or advantages to a drug. This review covers all the aspects of medicated chewing gum (MCG) as a new drug delivery method, including the benefits and drawbacks, manufacturing methods, type of MCG, composition of chewing gum, evaluation parameters, factors that affected the release of API, its pharmaceutical significance, various marketed chewing gum and chewing gum packaging. Chewing gum as a drug delivery system has the potential to cure or prevent various indications, such as analgesic, CNS stimulation, smoking cessation, motion sickness, and treatment and prevention of dental caries or gingivitis. Pharmaceutical distribution to the oral mucosa can be made more convenient and enticing with the help of MCG. Compared to conventional techniques, this delivery system has a longer-lasting effect, which makes it a viable option for treating digestive problems, headaches, migraines, coughing, anxiety, and allergies.",

Nevertheless, few randomized controlled trials have investigated the effects of gum-chewing exercises on oral function in older adults. This study aimed to examine the effect of gum-chewing exercises on oral function in older adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-blind, randomized controlled trial, conducted from November 2021 to January 2022. A total of 130 participants were divided randomly into the intervention and control groups. The intervention group was told to chew experimental gums for one month, while the control group was instructed to chew experimental tablets for one month. Maximum bite force, occlusal contact areas, oral dryness, tongue pressure, tongue and lip functions (number of times each of the following syllables is pronounced per second:/pa/,/ta/, and/ka/), masticatory function, subjective masticatory function, and gum-chewing time were measured at baseline and one month following intervention to assess outcomes. RESULTS: One month following the intervention, tongue pressure was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (P = 0.027). In the within-group comparisons, maximum bite force (P < 0.001), unstimulated saliva flow (P < 0.001), tongue and lip functions (/pa/: P < 0.001;/ta/: P < 0.001;/ka/: P < 0.001), color scale value (P = 0.019), and ΔE value (P = 0.024) were significantly increased in the intervention group. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that gum-chewing exercises can improve oral functions in older adults, although additional increases in masticatory load may be necessary to establish a more effective oral function training method using gum-chewing exercises in older adults."

      "abstract": "The use of titanium as a biomaterial for the treatment of dental implants has been successful and has become the most viable and common option. However, in the last three decades, new alternatives have emerged, such as polymers that could replace metallic materials. The aim of this research work is to demonstrate the structural effects caused by the fatigue phenomenon and the comparison with polymeric materials that may be biomechanically viable by reducing the stress shielding effect at the bone-implant interface. A numerical simulation was performed using the finite element method. Variables such as Young's modulus, Poisson's coefficient, density, yield strength, ultimate strength, and the S-N curve were included. Prior to the simulation, a representative digital model of both a dental implant and the bone was developed. A maximum load of 550 N was applied, and the analysis was considered linear, homogeneous, and isotropic. The results obtained allowed us to observe the mechanical behavior of the dental implant by means of displacements and von Mises forces. They also show the critical areas where the implant tends to fail due to fatigue. Finally, this type of non-destructive analysis proves to be versatile, avoids experimentation on people and/or animals, and reduces costs, and the iteration is unlimited in evaluating various structural parameters (geometry, materials, properties, etc.)."

      "abstract": "Inoculation with rhizobacteria and feeding by herbivores, two types of abiotic stress, have been shown to increase the production of secondary metabolites in plants as part of the defense response. This study explored the simultaneous effects of inoculation with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens GB03 (a PGPR species) and herbivory by third-instar Spodoptera frugiperda larvae on essential oil (EO) yield and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in Ocimum basilicum plants. The density of glandular trichomes was also examined, given that they are linked to EO production and VOC emission. Herbivory increased EO content, but inoculation on its own did not. When combined, however, the two treatments led to a 10-fold rise in EO content with respect to non-inoculated plants. VOC emissions did not significantly differ between inoculated and non-inoculated plants, but they doubled in plants chewed by the larvae with respect to their undamaged counterparts. Interestingly, no changes were observed in VOC emissions when the treatments were tested together. In short, the two biotic stressors elicited differing plant defense responses, mainly when EO was concerned. PGPR did not stimulate EO production, while herbivory significantly enhanced it and increased VOC emissions. The combined treatment acted synergistically, and in this case, PGPR inoculation may have had a priming effect that amplified plant response to herbivory. Peltate trichome density was higher in inoculated plants, those damaged by larvae, and those subjected to the combination of both treatments. The findings highlight the intricate nature of plant defense mechanisms against various stressors and hint at a potential strategy to produce essential oil through the combined application of the two stressors tested here."

Thus, this study aimed to assess the tolerability of a chewing gum and its efficacy on gingivitis in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Enrolled subjects (n = 60, 18-70 years) were randomized to receive two chewing gums or a placebo daily for 3 months. At baseline (t0) and monthly (t1, t2, and t3) timepoints, the Quantitative Gingival Bleeding Index (QGBI), the Modified Gingival Index (MGI), and the Oral Health 15 items (OH-15)] were employed to assess potential improvements in gingivitis. Pain was self-quantified via the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Severity of illness (CGI-S) helped in evaluating the oral general conditions. This study is listed on the ISRCTN registry. At t3, the QGBI, MGI, OH-15, VAS, and CGI-S values decreased in the treated but not in the placebo group (β = 0.6 ± 0.1, t176 = 3.680, p < 0.001; β = 0.87 ± 0.21, t115 = 4.263, p < 0.001; β = 5.3 ± 2.5, t172 = 2.086, p = 0.038; β = 3.16 ± 0.51, t88 = 6.253, p < 0.001; and β = 1.09 ± 0.32, t83 = 3.419, p < 0.001, respectively).

An intercontrol test was conducted on 20 patients who received Invisalign® treatment. Each participant was instructed to chew two pieces of Hue-Check Gum® chewing gum (one pink and the other blue) in 5, 10, and 20 cycles both with and without aligners. After being removed from the oral cavity, the gum was dried and pressed using a 1 × 50 × 50 mm model that was 3D printed with a transparent layer in between. After being scanned on both sides with a flatbed scanner at 600 dpi, the samples were saved as jpg files and subjected to an optoelectronic examination using ViewGum software. To validate the procedure, a control group from a different institution (University of Bern) was used. A statistical analysis of the data was carried out. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to confirm the normality of the samples. A one-way ANOVA test, a homogeneity of variance test, and a t-test did not reveal statistically significant differences between the two control groups, thus validating the methodology employed. In summary, clear aligners do not radically change the masticatory function while they are worn. As a result, clinicians can exploit the aligners for chewing to obtain a better fit of the plastic material to the dental surface and to attachments. Treatment times for patients could also be shorter."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postoperative ileus remains the most common cause of prolonged hospital stay after abdominal surgery. Various agents have been tested in the treatment of postoperative ileus but no agent alone has achieved effectiveness as postoperative ileus is of multifactorial aetiology. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of combined use of gum-chewing and parenteral metoclopramide on the duration of postoperative ileus after abdominal surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a randomised controlled study of patients aged 16-65 years who underwent elective abdominal surgeries. Patients were randomised into a gum-metoclopramide (GM) group, a gum-only (G) group, a metoclopramide-only (M) group and a control (C) group. Patients in the GM group chewed gum and received intravenous metoclopramide, each 8 hourly. In G group, patients chewed only gum, whereas those in M group received only 10mg of intravenous metoclopramide, 8 hourly. To C group, 10 mL of intravenous sterile water was given 8 hourly. Patients were monitored for time to passage of first flatus or faeces. Groups were compared for the duration of postoperative ileus and duration of hospital stay using analysis of variance. Statistical significance was set at a P value of <0.05. RESULTS: Fifty-two out of the 105 recruited patients were eligible for analysis. The male-to-female ratio was 1:1.9 with a median age of 57.0 years (interquartile range [IQR] =16 years). Prolonged postoperative ileus occurred in 9.4% (n = 5) of the patients (GM = 2, G = 1, M = 2, C = 0; P = 0.604) and was associated with longer duration of nasogastric tube use (P = 0.028). The duration of postoperative ileus was 3 days (IQR = 2), 2.5 days (IQR = 3.3), 4 days (IQR = 1.5) and 3 days (IQR = 2) in the GM, G, M, and C groups, respectively (P = 0.317), whereas the median duration of hospital stay was 7 days (IQR = 3), shortest in G group (6.5 days, IQR = 8) and longest in M group (9 days, IQR = 3) (P = 0.143). CONCLUSIONS: The combined use of gum-chewing and parenteral metoclopramide had no effect on the duration of postoperative ileus following abdominal surgeries in adult surgical patients."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: A systematic review of published data was carried out to assess the caries-preventive effects of xylitol chewing gums and candies in children. METHODS: Electronic and hand searches were performed to find clinical studies on the effects of xylitol chewing gums and candies on dental caries in children (≤ 18 years). Prospective randomised or controlled clinical trials published before 2023 were included in the review. RESULTS: The initial search identified 365 titles to be evaluated. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 15 articles with either fair or low quality were reviewed. Nine articles studied chewing gums, five candies, and one both of them. In the ten evaluated xylitol chewing gum studies xylitol consumption significantly reduced caries occurrence when compared with no treatment or a placebo polyol gum. The effect was clinically significant in studies with high or moderate caries level at study baseline. The results also suggested that the caries-reducing effect of xylitol gums may differ from sorbitol/polyol gums. In five of the six heterogenous xylitol candy studies, no caries-reducing effect was found independent of caries level. In addition to caries level, also the daily xylitol dose was a confounding factor. CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that the caries-reducing effect of adding xylitol chewing gum to the daily diet has been well demonstrated in children and adolescents with high or moderate caries level at study baseline. Xylitol gum use could benefit subjects with active incipient caries lesions on smooth tooth surfaces.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 71 subjects: 19 patients with occlusally symmetric BPXB (M = 9; F = 10; mean age 9.3 ± 2.2[yr.mo]), 32 patients with occlusally asymmetric BPXB (19 with more teeth in crossbite on the right side (right prevalent side), M = 7; F = 12; mean age 8.2 ± 1.6 [yr.mo] and 13 on the left side, M = 7; F = 6; mean age 9.6 ± 1.9 [yr.mo]) and 20 controls without malocclusion (M = 8; F = 12; mean age 10.2 ± 1.7 [yr.mo]). Masticatory patterns were recorded before (T0) and after (T1) the correction of the malocclusion with FGB, with the K7-I® kinesiograph using standardized soft and hard boluses. RESULTS: BPXB was corrected in all included patients. At T0, the percentage of RCCs in BPXB was significantly increased compared to controls (P < .0001); symmetric BPXB showed no difference in RCCs between the sides, whereas asymmetric BPXB showed significantly more RCCs on the side with more teeth in crossbite (prevalent side). After treatment with FGB (T1), the percentage of RCCs was significantly reduced in both symmetric BPXB patients (soft bolus, P = .003; hard bolus, P < .001) and asymmetric BPXB patients (prevalent side: soft and hard bolus, P < .00001; non-prevalent side: soft bolus, P = .01 and hard bolus, P = .0002).

      "abstract": "Khat chewing is a deep-rooted socio-cultural tradition that affects appetite, gastric emptying, and food intake, ultimately influencing nutritional status. Moreover, there is significant variation in lifestyles and ways of living among khat chewing and non-chewing people. However, there is limited evidence on the disaggregated determinants of undernutrition among khat chewers and non-chewers in Ethiopia. A community-based comparative cross-sectional study was conducted with 253 Khat-chewing and 249 non-chewing male adults in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Weight and height were measured under standard procedure and used to calculate the body mass index (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 indicates undernutrition). Variables with p-values below 0.25 in the bi-variable analysis were entered into a multivariable logistic regression model to identify factors associated with undernutrition and to control confounding respectively. An adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was used to declare the presence and the strength of association between the independent and outcome variable. Statistical significance was declared at a p value of 0.05. In this study, a total of 138 (27.5%: 23.6-31.6%) adult males were undernourished; among them, 78 (32.0%) were khat chewers and 60 (23.9%) were non chewers. Christian religion (AOR = 1.49; 1.02-2.30), vegetable consumption (AOR = 1.69; 95% CI 1.12-2.55) and khat chewing (AOR = 1.60; 1.04-2.45) were independent risk factors for undernutrition. However, none of the above factors showed a statistically significant association among non-khat chewer male adults. In conclusion, undernutrition was a public health concern in male adults in the study area. Frequent consumption of fruits, vegetables and family size of the households were the independent predictors of undernutrition. The practical implication of identifying risk factors of undernutrition among chewers and non-chewers could be helpful in depicting the relevant risk factors by exposure category and helping to further refine intervention packages. In addition, focusing on interventions which can increase the availability and accessibility of fruits and vegetables are important to improve the nutritional status of adult male populations.",

Evaluate the effectiveness of biofeedback therapy in the complex rehabilitation of masticatory muscle hypertonicity in patients with a high level of anxiety. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 40 patients aged 20 to 32 years with complaints of fatigue and discomfort in the area of chewing muscles, teeth compression during the day, nocturnal bruxism, crowding of teeth. Two groups were formed: the study group, whose patients underwent splint therapy in combination with biofeedback therapy trainings; in the control group, patients received treatment with splint therapy without the use of biofeedback therapy. Electromyography of the masticatory muscles at rest and during compression were used to diagnose hypertonicity of the masticatory muscles. To assess the psycho-emotional state, a medical and social questionnaire was conducted using questionnaires: «Health Questionnaire», Beck Depression Inventory, Spielberger-Khanin Anxiety Scale, SF-16 Quality of Life Scale. RESULTS: A decrease in the level of depression, anxiety was revealed with the stabilization of emotional sensitivity in relation to other people, emotional involvement in everyday life, and an increase in the quality of life. When comparing electromyographic data at rest and during clenching of teeth in patients of the study group the indicators were lower than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of biofeedback therapy at the stages of orthodontic treatment using splint therapy was established in the form of a decrease in the activity of masticatory muscles in patients of the study group. In the control group, the index of masticatory muscle activity decreased to a lesser extent. Biofeedback methods have shown a high level of effectiveness in reducing the symptoms of anxiety and depression, improving the quality of life.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two resin matrix ceramic blocks (Vita Enamic and Lava Ultimate) were divided into 4 groups according to the surface treatments: Bur grinding (control), Bur grinding + silane, 9.5% HF acid etching, and 9.5% HF acid etching + silane. The single bond universal adhesive was applied on all specimens after the surface treatments according to the manufacturer's instructions, it was administered actively on the treated surface for 20 s and then light cured for 10 s, followed by incremental packing of composite resin to the treated surface. Each group was further divided into 2 subgroups (with/without chewing simulation for 500,000 cycles). A micro tensile bond strength test was performed for each group (n = 15). The effect of surface treatments on the materials was examined by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The micro tensile bond strength (MPa) data were analyzed with a three-way ANOVA, the independent t-test, and one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey post-hoc test. RESULTS: µTBS results were significantly higher for Lava Ultimate than Vita Enamic for all the surface treatment protocols with (p < 0.01). The chewing simulation significantly negatively affected the micro-tensile bond strength (p < 0.001). Bur grinding + saline exhibited the highest bond strength values for Lava Ultimate, both with and without chewing simulation. For Vita Enamic, bur grinding + saline and HF acid + saline showed significantly higher bond strength values compared to other surface treatments, both with and without chewing simulation (p ≤ 0.05). CONCLUSION: Bur grinding + silane could be recommended as a durable repair protocol for indirect resin matrix ceramics blocks with composite resin material.",

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are often used by smokers as an aid to stopping smoking, but evidence is limited regarding their efficacy compared with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and no evidence is available on how their efficacy compares with that of varenicline. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether ECs are superior to NRT and noninferior to varenicline in helping smokers quit. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a randomized clinical trial conducted at 7 sites in China and including participants who were smoking at least 10 cigarettes per day and motivated to quit, not using stop-smoking medications or EC, and willing to use any of the study products. Participants were first recruited in May 2021, and data analysis was conducted in December 2022. INTERVENTIONS: A cartridge-based EC (30 mg/mL nicotine salt for 2 weeks and 50 mg/mL after that), varenicline (0.5 mg, once a day for 3 days; 0.5 mg, twice a day for 4 days; and 1 mg, twice a day, after that), and 2 mg (for smokers of ≤20 cigarettes per day) or 4 mg (>20 cigarettes per day) nicotine chewing gum, all provided for 12 weeks and accompanied by minimal behavioral support (an invitation to join a self-help internet forum). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was sustained abstinence from smoking at 6 months as validated by an expired-air carbon monoxide reading (<8 parts per million). Participants lost to follow-up were included as nonabstainers. RESULTS: Of 1068 participants, 357 (33.5%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 33.9 (3.1) years. A total of 409 (38.3%), 409 (38.3%), and 250 (23.4%) participants were randomized to the EC, varenicline, and NRT arms, respectively. The 6-month biochemically validated abstinence rates were 15.7% (n = 64), 14.2% (n = 58), and 8.8% (n = 22) in the EC, varenicline, and NRT study arms, respectively. The quit rate in the EC arm was noninferior to the varenicline arm (absolute risk reduction, 1.47%; 95% CI, -1.41% to 4.34%) and higher than in the NRT arm (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.15-3.21). Treatment adherence was similar in all study arms during the initial 3 months, but 257 participants (62.8%) in the EC arm were still using ECs at 6 months, with no further use in the 2 other study arms. The most common adverse reactions were throat irritation (32 [7.8%]) and mouth irritation (28 [6.9%]) in the EC arm, nausea (36 [8.8%]) in the varenicline arm, and throat irritation (20 [8.0%]) and mouth irritation (22 [8.8%]) in the NRT arm. No serious adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this randomized clinical trial found that when all treatments were provided with minimal behavior support, the efficacy of EC was noninferior to varenicline and superior to nicotine chewing gum.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This systematic review aimed to verify whether anatomic, semi-anatomic, or nonanatomic occlusal morphology of artificial teeth improves the masticatory function of complete or removable partial denture wearers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: According to the PICO strategy, six databases and the grey literature were searched to identify randomized (RCT) and non-randomized clinical trials (N-RCT) comparing masticatory function, in terms of masticatory performance and efficiency, and muscle activity as primary outcomes; and patient-reported results (O) in individuals using removable dentures (P) with different occlusal morphologies of artificial teeth (I/C). Masticatory ability, satisfaction with the prosthetic treatment, and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2.0) for RCT and Risk of Bias for non-randomized studies with intervention (ROBINS-I) for N-RCT studies. Meta-analyses were performed to compare primary outcomes and masticatory ability between the occlusal morphologies of artificial teeth of complete or removable partial dentures (α = 0.05). Certainty of the evidence was verified using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Eleven studies (seven RCTs and four N-RCTs) were included. The risk of bias was considered low for two studies, some concerns for five, and high for the last four studies. Meta-analyses showed that removable partial dentures with anatomic artificial teeth improved masticatory efficiency for carrot chewing (MD 6.31; 95% CI [3.39, 9.22], I2 = 0%). However, masseter and temporal muscle activities increased when removable partial dentures with nonanatomic teeth were used (MD -756.97; 95% CI [-892.25, -621.68], I2 = 100%). Masticatory ability was not influenced by occlusal morphology during chewing of all foods in complete denture users: Carrot (MD -0.88, 95% CI [-8.98, 7.23], I2 = 57%); sausage (MD -8.86, 95% CI [-23.05, 5.33], I2 = 71%); apple (MD -5.78, 95% CI [-28.82, 17.26], I2 = 87%); and cheese (MD -4.16, 95% CI [-15.14, 6.82], I2 = 62%). The certainty of evidence for all evaluated outcomes was very low, mainly due to very serious problems found in the parameters of inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the very low certainty of evidence, the occlusal morphology of artificial teeth influences masticatory function. Anatomic teeth improved the masticatory efficiency and muscle activity of removable partial denture wearers. Nonanatomic teeth increased temporal and masseter muscle activity, which negatively affected chewing in removable partial denture users. However, patients using complete dentures with anatomic and semi-anatomic teeth presented similar masticatory ability.",

Thirty-minute sessions of gum chewing were significantly more effective in reducing vomiting than 15-minute sessions (P = .04; risk ratio = 0.31; 95% Cl = 0.1-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that repeated gum chewing sessions of at least 30 minutes may act as a nonpharmacological intervention for reducing vomiting. However, further studies are necessary to determine the outcomes of chewing gum interventions.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Chewing gum (especially sugar-free gum) has been linked to improved oral health, however there is an absence of observational research using nationally-representative data in the United States. We sought to examine the factors associated with chewing gum and its relationship with the oral health status of U.S. adults. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2018 cycles were used in these analyses. Primary outcomes were the odds of having gum disease, treatment for gum disease, ever being told of bone loss around teeth, root caries, caries, and restoration. Unadjusted and multivariate logistic regression models were used to investigate the relationship of chewing gum use with demographic/lifestyle factors and the oral health status of participants. RESULTS: 2.40% (n = 365) of adults were users of chewing gum and the average among users was 5.20 ± 0.40 g/d. Users of chewing gum were more likely to be female, younger in age, and non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic. Self-reported chewing gum use did not affect the oral health status of U.S. adults (OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.42-2.88 for gum disease; OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 0.64-2.81 for treatment for gum disease; OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.27-1.17 for bone loss around teeth; OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.32-3.12 for root caries; OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.54-1.69 for caries), except for restoration (OR: 3.54, 95% CI: 1.78-7.06), but was associated with improved diet quality (OR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.11-3.12 for a healthy eating index (HEI) of 51-59; OR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.08-3.56 for HEI of 60-93); and decreased intakes of snacks (OR: 1.64, 1.01-2.69), and added sugars. CONCLUSION: Future observational studies that more accurately capture chewing gum usage are needed, as these analyses have several limitations.",

Tongue cancer predominates oral cavity cancers worldwide but in India it comes next to buccal mucosa. OPD patients after completing treatment tend to ask about the prognosis of their disease where they want an objective answer to \"How long will I live?\" His scoring system is intended to answer this question and guide patients for adjuvant therapy. This study enrolled all patients between 20 and 85 years old with a history of tobacco chewing at least for the last 1 year before diagnosis. Patients should have primary tongue cancer amenable to surgical resection. For survival calculation, date of diagnosis was taken as reference time. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, clinicopathological factors significantly associated with survival were ascertained. Then using logit regression, a scoring system predicting patient survival in years based on clinicopathological risk factors was formulated and internal validation was done. A total 241 were enrolled and there were 69 cancer-related deaths. T stage, N stage, LVSI, and DOI were found to be significantly associated with cancer-related survival in tongue cancer patients. Another factor affecting survival was defaulting adjuvant radiation therapy. Using these variables, a survival predicting score was developed. On internal validation and regression, the score was found 80% accurate with error limits ± 6 months. It is a concise comprehensive score applicable on Indian population with history of tobacco chewing. It will not only help clinicians to tell patients about their survival expectancy but also help to counsel them for adjuvant therapy. However, external validation and if required recalibration incorporating other factors need to be done for this score."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-blinded parallel randomized controlled clinical trial, a total of 120 dental students were included and randomly allocated into four intervention groups: (1) CHX mouthwash (control(, (2) probiotic yogurt, (3) casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate chewing gum, and (4) xylitol chewing gum. Salivary S. mutans counts were evaluated at baseline, 15 days, and 30 days after initiation of the study and compared at different times and among different groups using the repeated measures analysis of variance design analysis and least significant difference test with SPSS software version 20. The level of significance was determined to be 0.05. RESULTS: The microorganism count variable at baseline, first, and second follow-ups was significantly different for all groups except the probiotic yogurt group (P = 0.340). S. mutans count was significantly different when comparing the first follow-up and baseline values in the CHX and xylitol gum groups (P = 0.027, P = 0.037). When comparing the second follow-up with baseline values, a significant difference was observed in the xylitol gum group (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Xylitol chewing gum seems to be a viable alternative to the gold standard (CHX mouthwash) in reducing the salivary count of S. mutans."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The values of plant-based products have taken on an expanding relevance in dentistry. Salvadora persica chewing stick (miswak) has been practiced for centuries and is recommended by the World Health Organization as a customary oral hygiene tool. The therapeutic effects of S. persica chewing stick are contributed by its mechanical cleansing action, active chemicals released, or the combination of these two actions. However, the S. persica chewing stick in its natural form can be difficult to maneuver in certain parts of the mouth. This concern has inspired the innovation of the S. persica toothbrush that is designed to merge the ease of use of a toothbrush with the beneficial natural properties of S. persica preserved in its bristle. The present study aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness between S. persica toothbrush, S. persica chewing stick and the standard toothbrush in plaque and gingivitis control. METHODS: In this single-blinded and parallel randomized controlled trial, 78 participants were randomly divided into three groups to either use (i) S. persica toothbrush (MTB); (ii) S. persica chewing stick (MCS); or (iii) standard toothbrush (STB) in a standardized manner for three weeks. Plaque Index (PI) and Periodontal Inflamed Surface Area (PISA) values, measuring plaque levels and severity of gingivitis, respectively, were evaluated at baseline, one- and three-week post-interventions. RESULTS: The MCS group showed a significant improvement in the mean PISA values of the anterior teeth compared to the MTB and STB groups (MCS: from 16.35 ± 10.03 to 3.41 ± 1.14; MTB: from 25.20 ± 14.01 to 3.57 ± 1.19; STB: from 26.54 ± 8.64 to 6.17 ± 0.86; p < .050). All three groups reported significant improvements (p < .001) in the plaque levels and the severity of gingivitis from baseline to three weeks after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Following correct techniques, S. persica toothbrush and chewing sticks are as effective as the standard toothbrush in plaque control and gingival health, which represent the reputed anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis properties of S. persica. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This clinical trial was prospectively registered in ClinicalTrials.gov with registration NCT04650685 (25/11/2020).",

Some individuals with autism or other developmental disabilities engage in rumination, and it can lead to multiple health issues. Previous research demonstrated that noncontingent presentation of chewing gum could be an effective treatment for reducing ruminations. The current study evaluated the effects of noncontingent chewing gum and contingent gum on rumination of an adolescent boy with autism and the results suggest that both treatments were effective, but contingent gum resulted in the lowest rate of rumination. • Rumination can cause multiple health issues including malnutrition, weight loss, esophagitis, tooth decay, and abnormal gastrointestinal symptoms. • Rumination in individuals with autism is often automatically maintained. • Continuous noncontingent gum and contingent gum may be viable treatments for rumination. • Contingent gum may be a more practical intervention for rumination relative to continuous noncontingent gum."

Design: Prospective, open label, pilot randomised controlled trial. Setting: Two metropolitan ICUs. Participants: Ninety postoperative adult patients admitted to the ICU. Intervention: Patients administered chewing gum, who chewed for at least 15 minutes every 4 hours, were compared with a control group, who were administered a 20 mL sip of water orally every 4 hours. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the number of patient-reported episodes of nausea in the first 24 hours after the operation. Secondary outcomes included vomiting or dry retching episodes, and duration and severity of nausea. Results: Forty-six patients were randomly allocated to chewing gum and 44 patients to water. There was no difference between groups in the number of patients with nausea (10 [22%] chewing gum v 12 [27%] control patients; P = 0.72), nausea episodes (22 episodes; [median, 0; IQR, 0-0] v 21 episodes [median, 0; IQR, 0-1] per patient in each group respectively), vomiting/retching (2 [4%] chewing gum v 6 [14%] control patients; P = 0.24), or duration/severity of nausea. Conclusion: Regular postoperative administration of chewing gum in a surgical ICU patient cohort did not reduce nausea, vomiting or retching. The prevalence of PONV is less than previously reported. Our findings can inform future studies of PONV prophylaxis in post-surgical ICU patients. Trial registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry No. ACTRN12617001185358."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Postoperative ileus is a common occurrence among children undergoing major operations, including gastrointestinal and spinal surgeries. Preliminary evidence in adults suggests that chewing gum plays a role in accelerating the return of postoperative gastrointestinal function. However, evidence is scarce in the paediatric population. The aim of this study was to investigate whether chewing gum has benefits for children. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Trials databases for randomised controlled trials that compare gum chewing with standard care after elective surgery in children from 1st Jan 2005 to 31st July 2021. We assessed the identified trials for quality and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with PRISMA and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022358801). The main outcome measures examined were time to flatus and stool postoperatively, time to tolerate oral intake, and length of hospital stay, which were analysed using fixed effects models. We also examined clinical complication rates and postoperative pain control. RESULTS: We included six eligible trials, with a total of 357 enrolled patients. The intervention was well tolerated without complications. There was no significant difference in time to flatus (-2.86 h; 95 % CI: -6.2 to 0.47 h, p = 0.09), time to stool (-6.39 h; 95 % CI: -13.9 to 1.2 h, p = 0.1), time to tolerate oral intake (-0.03 days; 95 % CI: -0.15 to 0.1 days, p = 0.68), and length of hospital stay (0.08 days; 95 % CI: -0.07 to 0.22 days, p = 0.29). Postoperative pain control (opioid consumption, pain score, nausea score) was similar in both groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Current evidence demonstrates that gum chewing is not associated with earlier postoperative gastrointestinal recovery in children. Future adequately powered and well-designed trials are necessary to evaluate any clinical benefit of chewing gum for children and whether it could result differences in healthcare satisfaction.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of chewing gum on orthodontic pain and to determine the rate of bracket breakage associated with fixed orthodontic appliances. METHODS: This review and its reporting were performed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the PRISMA guidelines. Six electronic databases were searched up to March 16, 2023, to identify relevant studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Furthermore, grey literature resources were searched. The Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool 2 was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan, and sensitivity analysis and publication bias analysis were performed using STATA software. GRADE tool was used to evaluate the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Fifteen studies with 2116 participants were ultimately included in this review, and 14 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with the blank group, chewing gum had a significant pain relieving effect at all times after fixation of the initial archwire (P ≤ 0.05). No significant difference was found between the chewing gum group and the analgesics group at any timepoints (P > 0.05). Only four studies evaluated the rate of bracket breakage and revealed that chewing gum did not increase the rate of bracket breakage. The sensitivity analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the pooled outcomes after the included studies were removed one at times, and Egger analysis revealed no significant publication bias in included studies (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Chewing gum is a non-invasive, low-cost and convenient method that has a significant effect on relieving orthodontic pain and has no effect on the rate of bracket breakage. Therefore, chewing gum can be recommended as a suitable substitute for analgesics to reduce orthodontic pain.",

Therefore, in this randomized controlled trial, we aimed to develop a gum-chewing training program and determine its effects in older adults. A total of 218 older adults, aged 65-85 years, were randomly allocated to the intervention or control groups. The intervention group chewed the experimental gum daily, whereas the control group consumed the experimental granular food daily. The outcome assessments measured the maximum bite force, occlusal contact areas, oral dryness, tongue pressure, tongue and lip functions, masticatory function, and gum-chewing time. The measured values for each outcome were compared between groups using the Mann-Whitney U test and within groups pre- and post-intervention using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A total of 211 participants completed the study. After 2 months, the intervention group had a significantly higher maximum bite force than the control group (p = 0.01), indicating that gum-chewing training improved maximum bite force in older adults. This was determined using one type of bite force measuring device. Therefore, it is suggested that gum-chewing training has a high potential to improve oral hypofunction."

      "abstract": "STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Determining the preferred chewing side may be an important factor in prosthetic treatment planning, especially where additional support for a removable dental prosthesis can be provided by implants. PURPOSE: The purpose of this clinical study was to investigate the validity and reproducibility of 3 different tests to determine the preferred chewing side. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 82 partial denture wearers, with an average age of 70 years, were enrolled in this study. The first test (CG) evaluated the left or right position of a piece of chewing gum after spontaneous mouth opening during mastication. A second test (ASI) videotaped 30 seconds of mastication and analyzed the distribution of masticatory cycles by means of an asymmetry index. For the third test (VAS), participants were asked to mark their subjective perception of their preferred chewing side on a visual analog scale representing the right and left sides. All the tests were performed and repeated in a randomized sequence. The reproducibility of the tests was first evaluated. The mean values of the ASI and VAS tests were calculated, and the results were compared with the second series of the CG test. The Pearson correlation test was used to associate ASI and VAS, and the Cohen kappa agreement was used for the inter-reliability of CG (α=.01). RESULTS: The results indicated fair to almost perfect reproducibility for the 3 tests. Kappa values were.37 (P<.01) for the CG,.47 (P<.01) for the ASI and.91 (P<.01) for the VAS. Correlation coefficients resulted in rho=.86 (P<.01) for the ASI and rho=.97 (P<.01) for the VAS. The correlation between ASI and VAS was excellent, with rho=.85 (P<.010). CG and ASI (test kappa=.36, P<.010) and CG and VAS (test kappa=.39, P<.010) showed fair agreement. CONCLUSIONS: ASI and VAS seem more reliable than CG to determine a patient's preferred chewing side and might be helpful within the context of prosthetic treatment planning, where additional support may improve denture function.",

Muscle synergies are a group of motor primitives that the CNS may combine to simplify motor control in human movement. This study aimed to apply the non-negative matrix factorization approach to examine the coordination of the masticatory muscles on both sides during chewing. Ten healthy individuals were asked to chew gum at different speeds while their muscle activity was measured using surface electromyography of the right and left masseter and temporalis muscles. Regardless of the chewing speed, two main muscle synergies explained most of the muscle activity variation, accounting for over 98% of the changes in muscle patterns (variance accounted for >98%). The first synergy contained the chewing side masseter muscle information, and the second synergy provided information on bilateral temporalis muscles during the jaw closing. Furthermore, there was robust consistency and high degrees of similarity among the sets of muscle synergy information across different rate conditions and participants. These novel findings in healthy participants supported the hypothesis that all participants in various chewing speed conditions apply the same motor control strategies for chewing. Furthermore, these outcomes can be utilized to design rehabilitation approaches such as biofeedback therapy for mastication disorders."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This observational and cross-sectional study included 109 patients diagnosed with unilateral mTMD. Surface electromyography was used to separately evaluate the MMA of the masseter and TA on the affected and unaffected sides. Also, pain intensity (with a visual analog scale), pressure pain threshold (with an algometer), active pain-free maximum mouth opening and temporomandibular joint lateral movements (with a ruler), cervical range of motions (with a goniometer), and TMD severity (with a Fonseca Anamnestic Index) were assessed. Various statistical methods were used to predict the MMA of the masseter and TA, including standard, forward, and best subsets multiple regression models. RESULTS: While there were significant correlations between the MMA of the masseter and TA and pain intensity, pressure pain threshold values, and TMD severity, they were not found with other variables. These parameters were also predictive factors for MMA of both muscles (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: According to the present study, pain intensity, muscle and joint tenderness, and the severity of the disorder are predictive factors for MMA of the masseter and TA muscles in patients with mTMD. It is recommended that these parameters be considered when establishing clinical evaluation and treatment programs focusing on MMA in patients with mTMD. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The pain intensity, masticatory muscles and TMJ tenderness, and disorder severity are predictors for MMA of the masseter and TA in patients with mTMD. Pain intensity has the most significant importance.",

Much clinical evidence suggests that chewing betel nut has pro-inflammatory and carcinogenic effects, but there are few clinical reports of acute toxicity caused by it, especially involving esophageal damage. CASE PRESENTATION: We presented a case of a 72-year-old female who was admitted to our hospital for chest pain and hematemesis within several minutes after chewing betel nut. Gastroscopy showed two longitudinal ridge-like mucosal eminences in the esophagus located 20 cm from the incisors down to the gastric cardia, which was similar to varices. At last, a CT scan showed concentric-circle thickening of the esophagus wall, suggesting hematomas. Our treatment included fasting, inhibiting gastric acid and maintaining blood volume. After one week of medical treatment, rechecked gastroscopy showed that esophageal hematomas were gradually absorbed, with the formation of multiple shallow ulcers. CONCLUSIONS: The acute toxicity of chewing betel nut can be easily overlooked. Patients who experience chest pain or hematemesis after chewing betel nut products,especially those who take aspirin at the same time, need to be alert to esophageal hematoma."

The purpose of this study was to determine whether bit chewing, a form of sham feeding, decreases the gastric emptying time (GET), small intestinal transit time (SITT), and total orocecal transit time (OCTT) in clinically normal horses in a prospective crossover study. Nine healthy horses were acclimated and fed a standardized diet. Following 24 h of fasting, self-contained video endoscopy capsules and acetaminophen were administered into the stomach via a nasogastric tube. Each horse underwent experimental (bit chewing for 20 min every 6 h) or control (no bit chewing) conditions, with a 3-week minimum washout period between conditions. The horses were enrolled in either part of the study until all video capsules were retrieved and/or 30 days lapsed. The video capsules were recovered from manure, and GET, SITT, and OCTT were determined from a video analysis. Bit chewing significantly decreased OCTT (p = 0.015) compared to the control conditions. Bit chewing decreased GET and SITT, but the differences were not significant. The mean (median) times determined via the video capsule analysis for the bit-chewing conditions were as follows: GET, 2.34 h (2.86 h); SITT, 3.22 h (3.65 h); and OCTT, 5.13 h (6.15 h), and for the control conditions, they were as follows: GET, 3.93 h (5 h); SITT, 3.79 h (4.4 h); and OCTT, 8.02 h (9.92 h). Bit chewing decreased OCTT in healthy horses. Because this segment of the gastrointestinal tract is frequently affected by ileus, bit chewing may be a safe and inexpensive intervention for that condition in horses. Further investigation in clinical patients with ileus is warranted."

The Karaduman Chewing Performance Scale (KCPS) and the Mastication Observation and Evaluation (T-MOE) instruments were used to evaluate chewing performance. Daily dietary intakes were measured from a 24-h food record with digital photographs including the amount and textures of all foods consumed during the meal. Chewing function was impaired in 70% of children. There was a negative low-to-moderate correlation between KCPS scores and daily protein intake (r = -0.32, p = 0.04), but not with energy and other macronutrients. The percentage of daily dietary intakes from 'liquid-blenderized' foods were positively correlated with KCPS, and negatively correlated with T-MOE scores (p < 0.001). There was a significant negative association between the percentage of daily dietary intakes from 'easy to chew & regular solid' foods and KCPS scores, and a significant positive association was found with T-MOE scores. In conclusion, the amount of daily protein intake decreased, and daily intake ratios of energy and macronutrients from liquid-blenderized foods increased as chewing performance decreased in children with CP. Timely diagnosis and treatment of chewing dysfunction can serve as a useful treatment option to ensure adequate dietary intake in children with CP, and also to decrease the burden of their parents and improve their quality of life.",

      "abstract": "The parasitic wasp Cotesia congregata suppresses feeding in its host, the caterpillar Manduca sexta, during specific periods of wasp development. We examined both feeding behaviour and the neurophysiology of the mandibular closer muscle in parasitized and unparasitized control M. sexta to determine how the wasp may accomplish this. To test whether the wasps activated a pre-existing host mechanism for feeding cessation, we examined the microstructure of feeding behaviour in caterpillars that stopped feeding due to illness-induced anorexia or an impending moult. These microstructures were compared with that shown by parasitized caterpillars. While there were overall differences between parasitized and unparasitized caterpillars, the groups showed similar progression in feeding microstructure as feeding ended, suggesting a common pattern for terminating a meal. Parasitized caterpillars also consumed less leaf area in 100 bites than control caterpillars at around the same time their feeding microstructure changed. The decline in food consumption was accompanied by fewer spikes per burst and shorter burst durations in chewing muscle electromyograms. Similar extracellular results were obtained from the motorneuron of the mandibular closer muscle. However, chewing was dramatically re-activated in non-feeding parasitized caterpillars if the connectives posterior to the suboesophageal ganglion were severed. The same result was observed in unparasitized caterpillars given the same treatment. Our results suggest that the reduced feeding in parasitized caterpillars is not due to damage to the central pattern generator (CPG) for chewing, motor nerves or chewing muscles, but is more likely to be due to a suppression of chewing CPG activity by ascending or descending inputs.",

The aim of this research was to study the cytotoxicity, proliferative, and microbiological activities of the active ingredients in different types of cell cultures. The preclinical study of active pharmaceutical ingredients and their combinations was carried out using culture lines such as HepG2 (human hepatocarcinoma cells), Hek293 (human embryonic kidney cells), and MAEC (mouse aortic endothelial cells). MTT assays were used to analyse cytotoxicity and proliferative activity, while the state of antioxidant protection was assessed by the content of sulfhydryl groups and catalase activity. The determination of lipid peroxidation products was based on the level of TBA-active products. As a microbiological model for studying the effect of the developed dental medicine on the ability of the oral cavity microorganisms to form biofilms, the following strains were used: Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Candida albicans. The optical density of the formed biofilm was evaluated by the intensity of the experimental sample's colour on a StatFax 303 Plus photometer at a wavelength of 630 nm. The combination of ascorbic acid and lysozyme hydrochloride in the established concentrations (20 mg and 10 mg per 1 gum, respectively) resulted in a slight stimulation of cell proliferation without any toxic effects and increased antioxidant protection, preventing the development of oxidative stress. It was found that, in contrast to the separately used active substances, the combination of lysozyme hydrochloride and ascorbic acid inhibits the biofilm formation of all studied microorganisms and shows the ability to destroy diurnal biofilms of L. plantarum and fungi of the genus Candida, indicating potentiation and summation of the active pharmaceutical ingredients' composition effects in the developed dental medicine. Due to the observed positive pharmacological and microbiological action, the combination of lysozyme hydrochloride and ascorbic acid in the medicated chewing gum serves as a promising tool for the prevention and treatment of infectious and inflammatory diseases of the periodontium and mucous membranes and the prevention of caries."

However, adherence to NRT is very poor. Among the NRTs, nicotine gums and nicotine patches are the most widely available. This study mainly evaluates the efficacy of nicotine gum and nicotine patches as NRT using salivary cotinine levels as a biochemical validation measure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 72 known smokers who were willing to receive nicotine replacement therapy for cessation of smoking habits. The sample was divided into two groups: Group 1 tobacco smokers were offered nicotine chewing gum, and group 2 tobacco smokers were offered nicotine patches. Both groups received treatment for 12 weeks. At baseline and at the end of the trial period, the saliva samples were analyzed for cotinine levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The severity of smoking was assessed using the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). RESULTS: The quit rate was higher in the nicotine patch group compared with the nicotine gum group. On comparison of week one vs week twelve in the nicotine group nicotine gum group showed (CI: 18.10 to 13.83) and in the patch group (CI: 7.754 to 6.56) with P < 0.001. The pre- and post-cotinine estimation was significantly reduced for nicotine patches compared with nicotine gums, and patient compliance also yielded better results for nicotine patches. CONCLUSION: This study depicts that nicotine patches were better adhered to in comparison with nicotine gums, and salivary cotinine level is an effective biochemical validation measure."

METHODS: A total of 24 freshly extracted human mandibular molars were included in the study. Teeth with intact crowns and mature root apices that were devoid of caries, attrition, restorations, and cracks were selected and randomly assigned to 3 groups (n = 8) as follows: Group 1: TECs, Group 2: CECs, and Group 3: intact teeth (control group). After endodontic treatment, the teeth were restored with EverX bulk-fill composite and layered occlusally with nanohybrid composite SolareX and subjected to a chewing simulator where 240,000 masticatory cycles were simulated, which translates to 1 year of clinical function. The teeth were then subjected to static loading in a universal testing machine and the maximum load to fracture and the pattern of failure (restorable/unrestorable) were recorded. Data were evaluated with analysis of variance and the Tukey post hoc test for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: The CEC group had higher fracture resistance when compared with the TEC group; however, the difference was not statistically significant. The fracture resistance of the samples in the control group was statistically higher than those in the experimental groups (P < .005). CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference observed in the fracture resistance of mandibular molars with TECs and CECs subjected to masticatory loading.",

DATA SOURCES: We screened 5 major databases (Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Clinicaltrials.gov) from inception till February 2023. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: No language restrictions were applied. We included randomized controlled trials comparing the postoperative bowel function between patients who chewed and patients who did not chew gum postoperatively after laparoscopic gynecological procedures for benign indications. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Data from 5 studies on 670 patients were extracted and analyzed by 3 independent reviewers. Meta-analysis was performed with RevMan 5.4 software (Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Center, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2020), with mean differences (MDs), pooled risk ratios, and random-effects model. Postoperative gum chewing significantly reduced the time to first bowel sounds and the time to first passage of flatus (MD -2.58 hours 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.12 to -1.04 p = .001 and MD -3.97 hours 95% CI -6.26 to -1.68 p <.001, respectively). The time to first defecation, the time to first postoperative patients' mobilization, the length of hospital stay, and the risk of postoperative bowel obstruction showed no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. When subgroup analysis was performed according to the type of the laparoscopic procedure, it failed to reveal a positive impact of postoperative gum chewing in both the times to first passage of flatus and first defecation following laparoscopic hysterectomies (MD -5.35 hours 95% CI -10.93 to 0.23 p = .06 and MD -15.93 hours 95% CI -40.13 to 8.28 p = .20, respectively). CONCLUSION: The results of the present meta-analysis support that postoperative gum chewing following laparoscopic gynecological procedures seems to have a positive effect on the early mobilization of the gastrointestinal tract. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of the included randomized controlled clinical trials."

Restorative treatment represents an attempt to rebuild and recreate the lost structure. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to investigate whether restorative treatment of worn dentition (either with direct or indirect adhesive composite adhesive procedures or with prosthetic techniques) can have an impact on the masticatory performance parameters. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted on multiple databases (Pubmed, Medline CENTRAL, ICTRP), following the PRISMA guidelines. Abstracts of research papers were screened for suitability, and full-text articles were obtained for those who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Only one article meet the inclusion criteria of the review. Restorative treatment of worn dentition although have a positive impact on the self-report ability to chew, has no effect on the masticatory performance test. CONCLUSION: At the moment, not enough evidence to comment on the actual therapeutic role of restorative treatment on tooth wear is available. Clinicians, before taking any clinical decision, should carefully discuss with patients the needs and expectations of the treatment plan.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Xerostomia negatively affects quality of life. Symptoms include oral dryness; thirst; difficulty speaking, chewing, and swallowing food; oral discomfort; mouth soft tissue soreness and infections; and rampant tooth decay. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate if gum chewing is an intervention that results in objective improvements in salivary flow rates and subjective relief from xerostomia. METHOD: We searched electronic databases including Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library (CDSR and Central), Google Scholar and the citations of review papers (last searched 31/03/23). The study populations included: 1) elderly people with xerostomia (> 60 years old, any gender, and severity of xerostomia), and 2) medically compromised people with xerostomia. The intervention of interest was gum chewing. Comparisons included gum chewing vs. no gum chewing. The outcomes included salivary flow rate, self-reported xerostomia, and thirst. All settings and study designs were included. We conducted a meta-analysis on studies where measurements of unstimulated whole salivary flow rate for both a gum chewing, and no gum chewing intervention (daily chewing of gum for two weeks or longer) were reported. We assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's RoB 2 and ROBINS-I tools. RESULTS: Nine thousand six hundred and two studies were screened and 0.26% (n = 25) met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Two of the 25 papers had a high overall risk of bias. Of the 25 papers selected for the systematic review, six met the criteria to be included in the meta-analysis which confirmed a significant overall effect of gum on saliva flow outcomes compared to control (SMD = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.22-0.66; p = 0.00008; I2 = 46.53%). CONCLUSIONS: Chewing gum can increase unstimulated salivary flow rate in elderly and medically compromised people with xerostomia. Increasing the number of days over which gum is chewed increases the improvement in the rate of salivation. Gum chewing is linked with improvements in self-reported levels of xerostomia (although it is noted that no significant effects were detected in five of the studies reviewed). Future studies should eliminate sources of bias, standardise methods to measure salivary flow rate, and use a common instrument to measure subjective relief from xerostomia.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the effects of menthol gum chewing on nausea, vomiting, and length of hospital stay after appendectomy in children. BACKGROUND: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) can be induced by general anesthesia. Several drugs are available to reduce the risk of PONV; however, their cost and side effects limit their clinical use. METHOD: This was a randomized controlled clinical trial that included 60 children aged 7-18 years who underwent an appendectomy at the Pediatric Surgery Clinic of a tertiary hospital between April and June 2022. Data for this study were collected via the developed information form, which included participants' descriptive characteristics and bowel function parameters, and the Baxter Retching Faces (BARF) nausea scale. Children in the study group who underwent an appendectomy were given chewing gum and asked to chew it for an average of 15 min, whereas those in the control group received no intervention. RESULTS: The BARF nausea score measured during the menthol gum chewing period was lower in the study group, and the difference score value calculated after pretest time was higher in the study group, as expected (p < 0.001). Moreover, menthol gum chewing was found to shorten hospital stay by 1 day (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Menthol gum chewing reduced the severity of postoperative nausea and length of hospital stay. PRACTICE IMPLICATION: Chewing gum can be used as a nonpharmacological method by pediatric nurses in clinical practice to reduce the severity of postoperative nausea and length of hospital stay.",

      "abstract": "Tongue function is vital for chewing and swallowing and lingual dysfunction is often associated with dysphagia. Better treatment of dysphagia depends on a better understanding of hyolingual morphology, biomechanics, and neural control in humans and animal models. Recent research has revealed significant variation among animal models in morphology of the hyoid chain and suprahyoid muscles which may be associated with variation in swallowing mechanisms. The recent deployment of XROMM (X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology) to quantify 3D hyolingual kinematics has revealed new details on flexion and roll of the tongue during chewing in animal models, movements similar to those used by humans. XROMM-based studies of swallowing in macaques have falsified traditional hypotheses of mechanisms of tongue base retraction during swallowing, and literature review suggests that other animal models may employ a diversity of mechanisms of tongue base retraction. There is variation among animal models in distribution of hyolingual proprioceptors but how that might be related to lingual mechanics is unknown. In macaque monkeys, tongue kinematics-shape and movement-are strongly encoded in neural activity in orofacial primary motor cortex, giving optimism for development of brain-machine interfaces for assisting recovery of lingual function after stroke. However, more research on hyolingual biomechanics and control is needed for technologies interfacing the nervous system with the hyolingual apparatus to become a reality.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Preserving sufficient oral function and maintaining aadequate nutrition are essential for preventing physical frailty and the following long-term care. We recently developed the 6-month Comprehensive Awareness Modification of Mouth, Chewing And Meal (CAMCAM) program, in which participants gather monthly to learn about oral health and nutrition while eating a textured lunch together. This study examined whether the CAMCAM program could improve attitude and behavior towards oral health, mastication, and diet as well as ameliorate oral frailty in community-dwelling older adults. DESIGN: Single-arm pre-post comparison study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 271 community-dwelling adults (72.3 ± 5.7 years of age; 159 women [58.7%]) in 4 Japanese municipalities were recruited, of which 249 participants (92%) were assessed at the final evaluation. INTERVENTION: Participants gathered once a month at community centers to learn about oral health and nutrition while eating a \"munchy\" textured lunch containing proper nutrition. MEASUREMENTS: Oral frailty, frailty, and eating behavior were evaluated with the Oral Frailty Index-8 (OFI-8), Kihon checklist (KCL), and CAMCAM checklist, respectively. Participants were divided into Oral frailty (OF) and Robust groups according to OFI-8 scores. The differences in KCL and CAMCAM checklist results between the OF and Robust groups were statistically tested along with changes in scores after the program. RESULTS: KCL and CAMCAM checklist scores were significantly lower in the OF group at the initial assessment. OFI-8 and KCL findings were significantly improved in the OF group after completing the program (all P <0.05). Regarding the CAMCAM checklist, awareness of chewing improved significantly in the Robust group (P=0.009), with a similar tendency in the OF group (P=0.080). CONCLUSION: The findings of this pilot study suggest that the CAMCAM program may improve both oral and systemic frailty in addition to attitudes towards chewing, oral health, and meals, especially in individuals with oral frailty. The CAMCAM program merits expansion as a community-based frailty prevention program.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Betel quid (BQ) is the fourth most commonly used psychoactive substance and its use is highly prevalent among southeast Asian countries due to the influence of psychosocial, behavioral, and environmental factors. As a result, even young children and women are becoming addicted and find it difficult to achieve long-term abstinence. Systematic research addressing the influence of behavioral and psychosocial factors on BQ chewing is scarce, hence pointing to the need for understanding the interplay of these factors to develop tailored intervention strategies for BQ cessation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review is to assess various behavioral and psychosocial risk factors from pre-existing literature that lead individuals to initiate and/or maintain BQ chewing in developed and developing countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The electronic retrieval systems and databases PUBMED [MEDLINE], EMBASE, SCOPUS, WEB OF SCIENCE, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, and SCIENCE DIRECT were searched independently by two authors for relevant articles from January 2011 to July 2021 using combinations of keywords. Primary studies published in English focusing on the behavioral and psychosocial risk factors for BQ chewing were included. RESULTS: Out of the initial 264 articles searched, 12 articles met the selection criteria. Included studies addressed the influence of behavioral and psychosocial factors toward the initiation and/or maintenance of BQ chewing. Included studies reported that dependent BQ was not able to quit BQ chewing due to habituation, addiction, and withdrawal symptoms. Few social BQ chewers in Southeast Asian countries were not willing to initiate quitting as they considered AN as an important social and cultural identifier and claimed that they could not resist chewing in a peer group, and it has become part of their social life. CONCLUSION: In the future, studies should take into consideration behavioral and psychosocial risk factors, which are major barriers toward successful quitting. These factors should be integrated into areca nut cessation guidelines, and there is a need to develop more comprehensive culture-specific intervention approaches to achieve long-term abstinence.",

Materials and Methods: Two implant abutment groups-titanium (Ti) and titanium base (Ti-base; Medentika)-were used. A total of 40 mandibular first molar CAD/CAM monolithic zirconia crowns (Vita YZ T) were fabricated, then cemented onto the abutments with Panavia V5. Each abutment group was divided into two subgroups (n = 10). The Ti and Ti-base groups were subjected to a single load until fracture, and the Ti/CT and Ti-base/CT groups (CT: chewing simulation and thermocyclic aging) underwent chewing simulation (1.2 × 106 cycles × 50 N load, 1.4 Hz) and thermocylic aging (3,911 cycles/5°C to 55°C). The fracture resistances of the crowns were tested with a universal testing machine (1 mm/minute). Shapiro-Wilk and one-way ANOVA test were used for statistical analysis (P = .05). Results: The survival rates after chewing simulation and thermocyclic aging were 100% for both CT groups. The fracture resistance values (mean ± SD) of the groups were as follows: Ti = 1,718.18 ± 331.06 N, Ti-base = 1,713.53 ± 233.24 N, Ti/CT = 1,664.82 ± 188.62 N, and Ti-base/CT = 1,551.28 ± 344.79 N. According to one-way ANOVA test results, there was no statistically significant difference between the four groups (P = .526). Conclusion: CAD/CAM monolithic zirconia crowns supported by Ti-base or titanium abutments were found to have sufficient fracture resistance in the treatment of an absent single posterior tooth. However, more in vitro and clinical studies are required to evaluate the long-term performance of Ti-base abutments and CAD/CAM zirconia crowns.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to establish a simple predictive model for oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) in an area with a relatively low prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and frequent betel nut chewing. METHODS: A total of 116 patients with OPC were recruited from the clinical research database of a referral cancer center between 2013 and 2018. Patient characteristics-including age, gender, tumor stage, differentiation, and treatment modality-were extracted from the database. Patients diagnosed after 2018 were staged using the 7th AJCC staging system to explore the impact of extra-nodal tumor extension (ENE) on survival. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for p16, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), p53, and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). ENE status was evaluated by pathological analysis or radiological features. Primary outcome was disease-specific overall survival (OS). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression were used to establish a predictive model. RESULTS: Mean age was 57.3 ± 9.9 years; 103 patients (88.8%) were male. P16 positive OPC was positively associated with higher PD-L1 and a tonsillar sub-site and negatively associated with betel nut chewing and cigarette smoking. In Cox regression, age, p16 status, EGFR, cT4, ENE, and cigarette smoking were significantly associated with OS. In survival tree analysis, cT stage was the most important risk stratification parameter, followed by EGFR expression and p16 status. Patients with cT4 stage or high EGFR were classified as the high-risk group and had poorest OS. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the low prevalence of HPV and popularity of betel nut chewing in Asia, the relative importance of prognostic predictors for OPC are not identical to Western countries. Identification of significant prognostic biomarkers may improve treatment.

Only randomized controlled trials were included in this study. All of the studies were assessed independently and in duplicate in accordance with the exclusion and inclusion criteria. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias within the included studies, and the GRADE approach was used to evaluate the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Sixteen RCTs were included in the final analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that chewing gum significantly reduced pain intensity in comparison to pharmacologic agents (mean difference [MD] -0.50 [95% confidence interval {CI} -0.90 to -0.10], P = .01). When compared with a placebo, chewing gum significantly reduced pain intensity (MD -0.60 [95% CI -1.06 to -0.13], P = .01), while bite wafer and chewing gum groups had the same levels of reduction in pain intensity (MD -0.15 [95% CI -0.56 to 0.26], P = .48). CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment, chewing gum was significantly more effective than both pharmacologic agents and placebo in reducing orthodontic pain 24 hours after the initial placement of the archwire.",

      "abstract": "The supplementation of dairy cows with tannins can reduce the ruminal degradation of dietary protein and urine N excretion, but high concentration in the diet can impair ruminal function, diet digestibility, feed intake, and milk yield. This study evaluated the effect of low concentrations (0, 0.14, 0.29, or 0.43% of diet in DM basis) of a tannin extract from the bark of Acacia mearnsii (TA) on milking performance, dry matter intake (DMI), digestibility, chewing behavior, ruminal fermentation, and N partition of dairy cows. Twenty Holstein cows (34.7 ± 4.8 kg/d, 590 ± 89 kg, and 78 ± 33 d in lactation) were individually fed a sequence of 4 treatments in 5, 4 × 4 Latin squares (with 21-d treatment periods, each with a 14-d adaptation period). The TA replaced citrus pulp in the total mixed ration and other feed ingredients were kept constant. Diets had 17.1% crude protein, mostly from soybean meal and alfalfa haylage. The TA had no detected effect on DMI (22.1 kg/d), milk yield (33.5 kg/d), and milk components. The proportions in milk fat of mixed origin fatty acids (16C and 17C) and the daily secretion of unsaturated fatty acids were linearly reduced and the proportion of de novo fatty acids was increased by TA. Cows fed TA had linear increase in the molar proportion of butyrate and linear reduction in propionate in ruminal fluid, whereas acetate did not differ. There was a tendency for the ratio of acetate to propionate to be linearly increased by TA. Cows fed TA had a linear reduction in the relative ruminal microbial yield, estimated by the concentrations of allantoin and creatinine in urine and body weight. The total-tract apparent digestibility of neutral detergent fiber, starch, and crude protein also did not differ. The TA induced a linear increase in meal size and duration of the first daily meal and reduced meal frequency. Rumination behavior did not differ with treatment. Cows fed 0.43% TA selected against feed particles >19 mm in the morning. There were tendencies for linear decreases in milk urea N (16.1-17.3 mg/dL), urine N (153-168 g/d and 25.5-28.7% of N intake), and plasma urea N at 6, 18, and 21 h postmorning feeding, and plasma urea N 12 h postfeeding was reduced by TA. The proportion of N intake in milk (27.1%) and feces (21.4%) did not differ with treatment. Reductions in urine N excretion and milk and plasma urea N suggest that TA reduced ruminal AA deamination, whereas lactation performance did not differ. Overall, TA up to 0.43% of DM did not affect DMI and lactation performance, while there was a tendency to reduce urine N excretion.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of habitual chewing of khat (Catha edulis) on blood pressure, body mass index, and physiological aspects of sexuality among residents of an Ethiopian town. METHODS: A statistically determined and randomly selected sample of khat-chewing individuals in the town of Hosanna in Southern Ethiopia were included in the study. We used physical measurements and a self-administered questionnaire to collect the data, which was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The participants comprised a total of 420 with mean age = 28.7±5.7 years; 336 (80.0%) were male. Nearly half (201; 47.9%) were in the age-group 30-34 years. The adverse effects of khat use were assessed from the median score of each outcome, namely, physical problems, abuse potential, and social effects. Having a score above the median on each of the three target outcomes was equated with the presence of adverse effects. Adverse effects were reported among 341 of 420 (81.2%) participants, of whom 277 of 341 (81.2%) were male and 64 of 341 (18.8%) were female. The reported adverse effects were significantly higher among those who co-used tobacco, coffee, or tea with khat, with adjusted odds ratio = 4.8; CI: 2.86-8.22. CONCLUSIONS: Khat chewing was found to have a significant adverse effect on the health of individuals who indulged in it. This finding implies the need for urgent intervention from health authorities."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Prenatal stress affects the hippocampal structure and function in pups. Maternal chewing ameliorates hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairments induced by prenatal stress. In this study, we investigated hippocampal microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in pups of dams exposed to prenatal stress with or without chewing during gestation. METHODS: Pregnant mice were randomly assigned to control, stress, and stress/chewing groups. Stress and stress/chewing animals were subjected to restraint stress for 45 min three times daily from gestation day 12 to parturition, and were given a wooden stick to chew during the stress period. Four-month-old male pups were intraperitoneally administered with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Serum corticosterone levels were determined 24 h after administration. The expression levels of hippocampal inflammatory cytokines were measured, and the microglia were analyzed morphologically. RESULTS: Prenatal stress increased serum corticosterone levels, induced hippocampal microglia priming, and facilitated the release of interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α in the offspring. LPS treatment significantly increased the effects of prenatal stress on serum corticosterone levels, hippocampal microglial activation, and hippocampal neuroinflammation. Maternal chewing significantly inhibited the increase in serum corticosterone levels, suppressed microglial overactivation, and normalized inflammatory cytokine levels under basal prenatal stress conditions as well as after LPS administration. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that maternal chewing can alleviate the increase in corticosterone levels and inhibit hippocampal microglia-mediated neuroinflammation induced by LPS administration and prenatal stress in adult offspring.",
