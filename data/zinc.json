      "abstract": "Rationale: In the reconstruction of diabetic bone defects, 3D-printed scaffolds often encounter the challenge of limited and delayed tissue ingrowth in their central regions, which is critical for successful osseointegration and prognostic outcomes. Hyperglycemia induces endothelial apoptosis and impedes angiogenesis, thus inhibiting osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs). Methods: Drawing inspiration from the growth pattern of vines, we developed a Zn@BP/Si coating on the 3D-printed titanium scaffold to promote the coupling of angiogenesis and osteogenesis. This coating was achieved by Zn2+-modified black phosphorus (BP), which not only enhances the stability and photothermal properties of BP, but also prevents endothelial apoptosis. The effectiveness of Zn@BP/Si in the reconstruction of diabetic bone defects was investigated in rat model of diabetic femoral defect. Its effect on osteogenesis-angiogenesis coupling has also been explored in BMSCs and HUVECs. Results: Zn@BP/Si regulated mitochondrial dynamics and provided motivation for cell adhesion and migration, just like the climbing of vines. Notably, the regulation of enzymatic activity plays a crucial role in its inhibition of excessive mitochondrial fission. The results demonstrate that the Zn@BP/Si promotes the growth of \"vascular vines\" and ameliorates the angiogenic and osteogenic inhibition in diabetes. Conclusions: The study reveals the potential of bio-inspired Zn@BP/Si coating in angiogenesis-osteogenesis coupling and the treatment of diabetic bone defects.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder in which dopaminergic neurons progressively degenerate, resulting in impaired dopamine system function. The release and uptake of dopamine (DA) are modulated, in part, by free, ionic zinc (Zn2+), an essential signaling metal. Although alterations in Zn2+ homeostasis are implicated in PD, the influence of Zn2+ on DA release and uptake that occurs within the subsecond time frame has not been studied in PD, or other disorders. In this study, we combined caged-compound photolysis with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) at carbon-fiber microelectrodes to investigate the impact of Zn2+ photorelease on DA release and reuptake in PD-model zebrafish, generated by chronic treatment with rotenone, and vehicle-treated control fish. Our findings reveal that Zn2+ photorelease inhibited peak DA overflow by about 20% in brains from PD model fish but not in those from vehicle-treated fish. Further analysis of the stimulated release plots showed a significant decrease in the first order rate constant of uptake (k) and an increase in the half-life (t1/2) in brains from vehicle-treated fish but not in those from PD model fish. These differences were not apparent when waiting more than 200 ms to electrically stimulate the brain after the end of light application. Treatment with the free-radical scavenger TEMPOL reversed the effect of Zn2+ photorelease on DA release but not on DA uptake. Thus, oxidative stress likely plays a key role, acting reversibly on DA release and irreversibly on DA uptake. In summary, our study demonstrates the feasibility of our approach in elucidating the mechanisms underlying the effects of metal ions on Parkinson's disease."

      "abstract": "This study focused on evaluating the effectiveness of zinc selenide nanoparticles coated with green seaweed (Ulva fasciata) (ZnSe-Uf) against Leishmania major (L. major) in light of increasing drug resistance in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis and the growing necessity for new therapeutic options. Key characteristics of ZnSe-Uf, including shape, size, functional groups, zeta potential, and polydispersity index, were analyzed in detail. The study investigated the effects of different concentrations of ZnSe-Uf compared to meglumine antimoniate (MA; used as the control), on both the promastigote and amastigote forms of L. major, calculating the selectivity index (SI) for each. Analysis revealed that the dominant functional group in ZnSe-Uf was C-H stretching, attributed to polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins. The size of ZnSe-Uf ranged from 228.2-242.8 nm (P = 0.37), with a polydispersity index of 0.31-0.33 (P = 0.85), and a zeta potential ranging from -35.6 mV to -57.9 mV (P = 0.07) over a period of 90 days. The lethal concentration 50 (LC50) for ZnSe-Uf was 7.61 μg/mL, while for MA it was 17.37 μg/mL on promastigote (P = 0.03). On amastigote, the LC50 was 24.3 μg/mL for ZnSe-Uf and 12.3 μg/mL for MA (P = 0.04). The SI was 27.55 for ZnSe-Uf and 41.26 for MA (P = 0.02). The lower LC50 for MA on amastigote indicated its better effectiveness on L. major compared to ZnSe-Uf, suggesting that ZnSe-Uf may have a lower ability to concentrate in macrophages compared to MA. However, ZnSe-Uf still showed anti-leishmanial activity and was non-toxic to macrophages (SI > 10), indicating the need for further investigation on animal models.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a major risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases due to its damaging effects on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and associated pathologies. Oxidative stress-induced endothelial damage plays a critical role in BBB disruption, potentially leading to cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of two essential trace elements, zinc (Zn) and selenium (Se), against oxidative stress in human brain endothelial cells (HBCE5i) exposed to hypertensive shear stress. Using an innovative millifluidic system (LiveBox2), which allows for the precise simulation of continuous flow conditions, we replicated the hemodynamic forces associated with hypertension. METHODS: Cells were treated with ZnCl2 (5-50 µM) or Na2SeO3 (50-500 nM) at concentrations selected based on previous studies and confirmed by cytotoxicity assays. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that shear stress significantly altered the localization of the tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and induced the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NRF2, a hallmark of oxidative stress. Importantly, treatment with 10 µM ZnCl2 preserved ZO-1 membrane localization and prevented NRF2 translocation, as confirmed by quantitative image analysis. In contrast, Na2SeO3 did not provide comparable protection, although modest improvements in ZO-1 localization were observed in some replicates. DISCUSSION: We discuss potential reasons for selenium's limited efficacy, including differences in bioavailability and cellular uptake. Our findings underscore zinc's promising role as a neurovascular protector and suggest that further investigation into more complex in vitro models and in vivo studies is warranted."

      "abstract": "Rice (Oryza Sativa L.) is the main food of about half of the people in the world. In order to compare the treatments of iron and zinc nanofertilizers in three irrigation conditions, an experiment was conducted in the form of a split plot based on randomized complete blocks in three replicates on the Tarem Hashemi rice variety. The results of compound analysis showed that the effect of irrigation regime and zinc nano-fertilizer in all traits and the effect of iron nano-fertilizer in all traits except thousand seed weight have significant differences. In the review of the selected treatments for cultivation based on drought tolerance indices, treatments Tr2, Tr5 and Tr11 were selected as suitable treatments for cultivation in conditions of lack of humidity. The results obtained from the polygon diagram indicated that the Tr7 treatment can be selected as a suitable treatment in all three irrigation conditions. In the analysis of the results obtained from the ranking chart of the treatments in terms of traits, the Tr3 treatment was selected as a stable treatment in rice cultivation. In the examination of the diagram to identify the most appropriate treatment based on the ideal treatment, treatments Tr3 and Tr6 under normal conditions and treatment Tr2 under both conditions of irrigation stress were selected as optimal treatments. The grouping of treatments based on traits also showed that Tr8 and Tr9 treatments were very similar in terms of reaction to traits. In general, it can be concluded that in different irrigation conditions, according to the soil quality of the fields, the effect of zinc nano-fertilizer at medium concentration levels can have a favorable effect on increasing the quality of quantitative and qualitative traits of this plant, and low concentration levels of nano-fertilizer Iron can have a positive effect on increasing the quality of the product in the condition of lack of humidity.",

Plant-based natural compounds (PBCs) and metal(loid)-based antimicrobials (MBAs) are promising alternatives. This study evaluated the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and synergistic effects of zinc sulfate (ZnSO4), carvacrol (CV), and antibiotics (ciprofloxacin [CIP], tobramycin [TOB], and azithromycin [AZM]) against P. aeruginosa PAO1. Methods: The MIC and MBC of ZnSO4, CV, and antibiotics were determined using a 96-well plate method. Cytotoxicity was assessed via MTT assay. Fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC), fractional bactericidal concentration (FBC), minimal biofilm inhibition concentration (MBIC), and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) indices were calculated for each combination of agents. Checkerboard assays identified interactions, and the effectiveness of combinations was further evaluated in a mouse chronic lung infection model with treatments delivered intratracheally, intraperitoneally, and orally. Results: TOB had the lowest MIC and MBC values, proving most effective against P. aeruginosa PAO1. Strong synergy was observed with CV + ZnSO4 (CV + Zn) combined with CIP, CV with CIP, and CV + Zn with TOB, as indicated by low FIC indices. CV + Zn with TOB and CV with TOB had low FBC indices, while CV + Zn with AZM showed antagonism. In vivo, intratracheal TOB + CV + Zn reduced lung inflammation and tissue involvement, yielding the best histopathological outcomes. The MIC of CIP and TOB was reduced 5-fold and 4-fold, respectively, when combined with CV + Zn. Conclusions: CV + Zn demonstrated strong synergistic effects with antibiotics and effectively managed P. aeruginosa lung infections in mice. These findings highlight its potential as an innovative therapy for biofilm-associated infections."

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases of the aging population, with an incidence of more than 250 million affected people and annual treatment costs exceeding $80 billion. Osteoarthritis involves pain, stiffness, reduced mobility, and swelling of the joints due to cartilage wear and tear and inflammation, which results in a broad system affecting the joints. This review focuses on the relationship between zinc and copper and the effects of these minerals on osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease that currently affects millions of people and is characterized by the degradation of joint cartilage and inflammation. Zinc is crucial to the development of healthy cells, including cartilage, and copper keeps cartilage in balance and improves the immune response. If these elements are imbalanced, then symptoms of osteoarthritis may worsen, and studies have revealed that people with osteoarthritis exhibit increased levels of copper, which is the active factor in inflammation and cartilage breakdown. In osteoarthritis patients, the level of zinc is decreased, yet it plays an important role in bone and cartilage formation. Zinc and copper are interrelated because zinc has antioxidant properties, while copper might have a detrimental effect on cell injury. More investigations must be conducted on the therapeutic aspects of these processes and on how to improve the treatment of osteoarthritis. Knowledge of these relationships could allow for enhanced diagnosis, proper treatment, and therapy for people with osteoarthritis, hence enhancing quality of life."

      "abstract": "The study investigated the synthesis and characterization of zinc oxide nanoparticles (Am-ZnO-NPs) using Aegle marmelos leaves and their mosquitocidal, antioxidant, and anticancer efficacy. Am-ZnO-NPs were synthesized via combustion method under optimized conditions, including 5% plant extract, temperature of 70 °C, a contact time of 60 min, and pH of 10. The resulting nanoparticles were characterized using advanced analytical techniques. The Am-CuO-NPs were hexagonal wurtzite in shape and had an average particle size of 37.44 nm. The Am-CuO-NPs are highly stable with a surface charge of - 26.77 mV. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified several compounds with insecticidal, antioxidant, and anticancer properties, including hexadecenoic acid, ethyl ester (25.61%), 9,12-octadecadienoic acid, ethyl ester (12.64%), and 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid, ethyl ester (6.31%). The aqueous extract of A. marmelos (100 µg/mL) demonstrated the highest larvicidal (57.33%) and pupicidal (42.67%) activities compared to other solvent extracts. In contrast, Am-ZnO-NPs exhibited relatively higher larvicidal activity (86.67%) and pupicidal (56.00%) at 10 µg/mL. The nanoparticles also inhibited the activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and carboxylesterases and reduced the total protein (TP) levels in Ae. aegypti larvae. Further, both the aqueous leaf extract and Am-ZnO-NPs were effective in scavenging DPPH free radicals, achieving 76% and 94% inhibition, respectively, at a concentration of 125 µg/mL. Am-ZnO-NPs also exhibited cytotoxicity, induced cell cycle arrest, enhanced cell adhesion, and promoted apoptosis in L-132 lung cancer cell lines. Further, the Am-ZnO-NPs display potent antibacterial activity against clinical pathogens. These results highlight the role of phytochemicals in A. marmelos leaves for their effective biological activities."

This study aimed to identify P. aeruginosa efflux pumps and examine the effect of Zinc sulfate on these pumps. This study was conducted on 104 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates collected from different types of specimens. The antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of all isolates was examined by disc diffusion and microdilution methods. A Cartwheel test was done for phenotypic detection of P. aeruginosa efflux pumps in the presence and absence of zinc sulfate. The expression of efflux pumps encoding genes and their regulators in the presence and absence of zinc sulfate was measured using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. A high rate of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pattern was observed among the tested isolates (55.7%). Combining different antibiotics with Zinc sulfate exhibited synergistic effects against most of the studied isolates. The addition of sub-inhibitory concentrations of Zinc sulfate to the cartwheel test was found to inhibit efflux pump activity in all tested isolates. The expression of the positive regulator gene, mexT, was significantly decreased. Additionally, Zinc sulfate significantly upregulated the expression of the mexR gene (P-value < 0.05), a negative regulator of the MexAB-OprM efflux pump. Zinc sulfate demonstrated a strong antimicrobial effect against P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. We recommend the use of Zinc sulfate as an antibiotic adjuvant and efflux pump inhibitor in the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections to enhance the bacterium's susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.",

Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles attracting attention due to their potential in biomedical applications, such as cancer therapy and diagnostics. ZnO is a versatile compound with excellent UV-blocking, anti-inflammatory, and wide-bandgap semiconductor properties. This study focuses on the green synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles using 'Fioria vitifolia' leaf extract, as a reducing agent with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) aids in reducing particle size and preventing aggregation, enhancing nanoparticle stability. The ZnO nanoparticles were characterized using various techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDX), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-Vis Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS), and Photoluminescence (PL). These analyses confirmed the successful formation of ZnO nanoparticles. The nanoparticles demonstrated strong antimicrobial activity, especially against 'Enterobacter', and exhibited significant cytotoxic effects on lung cancer cells (A549), but has low toxicity to standard cells (L929). The IC50 values affirmed their potential as anticancer agents, suggesting their dual promise as antimicrobial and anticancer compounds. The enormous potential of biosynthesized ZnO nanoparticles as biological agents a sustainable substitute for chemically synthesized medications is highlighted in this study. The potential of the nanoparticles in a range of biomedical applications is highlighted by their ecologically friendly manufacturing process as well as their proven antibacterial and anticancer qualities."

Zinc plays a crucial role in wound healing, tissue regeneration, and immune responses. While zinc deficiency is common among patients with IBD, the effects of dietary zinc supplementation on the disease course remain unclear. In this study, 125 male C57BL/6 J mice were randomly divided into five groups: a control group (Con), a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) induction group, and three zinc supplementation groups receiving 160 ppm, 400 ppm, and 1000 ppm of zinc oxide nanoparticles ( ZnO NPs), respectively. The results showed that dietary supplementation with ZnO NPs significantly alleviated damage to the colonic mucosal epithelial cells and crypts in IBD mice, while effectively reducing the inflammatory response. Furthermore, ZnO NPs helps maintain the quantity and secretion function of goblet cells, restores normal expression levels of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and preserves the diversity of gut microbiota. Notably, a significant protective effect was observed with dietary zinc supplementation at 160 ppm. These findings suggest that ZnO NPs significantly improves TNBS-induced intestinal inflammatory damage by modulating the gut microbiota, mucus, and mechanical barriers."

However, the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy on PCa is restricted. Methods: To address this, we developed a tumor-targeted multifunctional liposomal platform (PTX-PS/Zn@Lip-Apt) for zinc-enhanced chemo-photodynamic therapy of PCa. Co-delivery of PTX and an aggregation-induced emission photosensitizer (TPEDPD) enables combined chemotherapy and photody-namic therapy. Zinc ions were loaded into liposomes to improve the chemosensitivity of PCa to chemodrugs. Then, the AS1411 aptamer was further modified onto the sur-face of the liposome to enhance its tumor targeting ability. Moreover, to improve the cellular uptake efficiency of the nanoparticles, the photochemical internalization (PCI) strategy was also employed. Results: In vitro experiments indicated that aptamer conjugation and PCI application enhanced the cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of PTX/PS-Zn@Lip-Apt. The zinc ion enhanced cytotoxicity could also be found. In vivo experiments demonstrated the good antitumor effect and biosafety of PTX/PS-Zn@Lip-Apt. Conclusions: Our findings provide an important basis for innovatively applying zinc-enhanced combined chemo-photodynamic therapy in prostate cancer."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nano-zinc oxide (nZnO) has attracted significant attention in bone tissue engineering due to its antibacterial properties, anti-inflammatory effects, biocompatibility, and chemical stability. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the enhancement of osteogenic differentiation by nZnO-modified tissue engineering materials, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly characterized. METHODS: This study aimed to identify the molecular mechanisms how nZnO promoted osteogenic differentiation and bone regeneration using transcriptome analysis, drug intervention, and shRNA knockdown techniques, etc. First, the study evaluated the in vivo effects of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) containing nZnO on bone regeneration using a mouse calvarial defect model. The impact of nZnO exposure on the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was then assessed. The combined treatment of nZnO and MSCs in GelMA for bone regeneration was assessed in the mouse calvarial defect model thereafter. RESULTS: nZnO induced osteoblastic differentiation to promote bone regeneration. nZnO activated the AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK)-ULK1 signals to stimulate autophagosomes formation and facilitate autophagy flow, which was the essential pathway to induce osteogenic differentiation. The combined treatment of MSCs and nZnO significantly enhanced bone regeneration in calvarial defect mice. Conversely, AMPK inhibitor Compound C (C.C) reversed the effects on autophagy flow and osteogenic potentiality induced by nZnO. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight that nZnO can regulate bone regeneration by activating autophagy through the AMPK/ULK1 signaling pathway, which may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for addressing bone defects using nZnO.",

      "abstract": "Aortic stenosis (AS) is a progressive condition characterized by valve calcification and significant morbidity, often requiring invasive intervention. The AS pathophysiology is multifaceted, with evidence suggesting a role for trace elements. However, whether zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) are associated with valve calcification is unclear. This exploratory study assessed the Zn and Cu levels in the serum and aortic valves of AS patients undergoing surgical valve replacement and explored the relationships between trace elements and clinical and biochemical parameters to better understand their potential roles in AS pathophysiology. An inverse relationship was observed between serum Zn levels and systolic pressure gradients across the valve (p < 0.0001). Zn accumulation was identified in calcified aortic valves, suggesting a systemic redistribution of Zn during disease progression. The valvular Cu/Zn ratio was reversed (<1) compared to that in serum. The lipoprotein(a), an inflammatory marker, was positively correlated with serum Cu levels (p = 0.0007) and the Cu/Zn ratio (p = 0.02). However, no direct association was found between valvular Cu content and the AS severity. The findings suggest that Zn depletion in serum, coupled with its accumulation in calcified valves, reflects a disease-driven redistribution mechanism that may serve a protective role against calcification progression. Additionally, the study highlights a potential interplay between Cu metabolism and inflammatory processes in AS. Further research is required to determine whether therapeutic modulation of Zn levels could offer benefits in AS management."

      "abstract": "This work describes a drug delivery system (DDS) based on the therapeutic anti-inflammatory efficacy of saponin gallate (SG), a combination of gallic acid and saponin, chemically conjugated via an ester linkage. This formulation was loaded onto a biocompatible gadolinium-doped zinc-gallium-layered double hydroxide (Zn/Ga@Gd-LDH) nanocarrier. FT-IR, XRD, SEM, and HPLC were used to characterize the synthesized materials. UV-visible spectroscopy was employed to investigate the drug release from SG-Zn/Ga@Gd-LDH at an optimized temperature (45 °C) and pH (5). The kinetic release behavior of SG-Zn/Ga@Gd-LDH nanoparticles suggested that the first-order kinetic model was the most appropriate for the release profile. The regression value (R2) of 0.96614 indicated an optimal and controlled release for therapeutic effectiveness and minimal adverse effects over 54 h. The in vitro and in vivo models confirmed that drug-loaded nanocarriers exhibited antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. Western blotting analysis suggested that SG-Zn/Ga@Gd-LDH abrogates the anti-inflammatory properties by halting the phosphorylation of pro-inflammatory proteins p-p65 and decreasing CRP levels involved in the NF-κB pathway. SG-Zn/Ga@Gd-LDH exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. SG-Zn/Ga@Gd-LDH treatment against an acute CCl4-induced liver injury model showed anti-inflammatory potential in histological parameters' study. Radiolabeling of the drug saponin gallate with 99mTc was carried out to determine its in vivo biodistribution. The chromatographic results indicated promising radiolabeling of up to 90% percentages. SPECT-CT imaging and ex vivo gamma counting in Wistar rats revealed different clearance rates of nanoparticles, aiding in the evaluation of the drug delivery nanosystem. The designed system also demonstrated antioxidant potential due to the SG compound having IC50 127.45 μg/mL free radical scavenging activity. Ga@Gd-LDH showed a tumor-suppressing ability of 79.89 ± 3.91% for viable cells against breast cancer MCF-7 cells. The developed formulation could thus be a conducive strategy against inflammatory diseases."

      "abstract": "To enhance the therapeutic efficacy of magnetic hyperthermia, the effective anisotropy energy barrier of magnetic nanoparticles must be optimized since it affects relaxation dynamics and self-heating capabilities. Tuning the magnetic anisotropy of soft zinc ferrite nanoparticles was achieved in this work via doping of ferromagnetic cobalt ions for controlled hyperthermia therapy. We synthesized four nanocrystalline zinc ferrites doped with cobalt ions of varying concentrations [Co x Zn1-x Fe2O4 (x = 0.00, 0.10, 0.30, and 0.50)] using the standard chemical co-precipitation method. The role of doping Co2+ ions in modifying the physical properties, including microstructural, electronic, optical and magnetic characteristics, of pure zinc ferrite nanoparticles was thoroughly investigated using several characterization techniques. The obtained TEM images verified good homogeneity in both the size and shape of the studied nanocrystalline ferrites. The optical indirect bandgap was estimated to be 1.55 ± 0.03 eV for the nanosized ferrites. Substitution of ferromagnetic cobalt ions in appropriate amounts improved the magnetic responses of the doped zinc ferrite nanoparticles, and thereby, several magnetic parameters such as coercivity, magnetic anisotropy and magnetization were observed to increase gradually. The tunable magnetic anisotropy energy barrier of pristine ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles was achieved via Co2+ ion doping, and consequently, the induction heating efficiency of the doped ferrite samples improved. Owing to the incorporation of magnetic cobalt ions, the blocking temperature was found to increase, which highly affected the relaxation dynamics and superparamagnetic behavior of the zinc ferrite nanoparticles. The presence of one semicircle in the Cole-Cole plot suggested that the grain boundaries played a more significant role than the conductive grains in determining the dielectric properties of the nanoferrites. The as-synthesized nanomaterials were further explored for the sensing of the herbicide metribuzin. It was observed that the conductivity of the Co2+ ion-doped zinc ferrite nanoparticles decreased in the presence of metribuzin, with 50% cobalt ion-doped zinc ferrite nanoparticles exhibiting a better performance compared with the pristine sample in metribuzin herbicide sensing. The limit of detection (LOD) was determined to be 1 ppm. Hence, it was successfully demonstrated that cobalt ion-incorporated zinc ferrite nanoparticles showed potential for use in magnetic hyperthermia and metribuzin herbicide sensing applications."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Managing electrolyte abnormalities is one of the cornerstones of properly caring for and managing hospitalized patients. Typically, electrolyte derangements are managed by direct repletion, volume status correction, or hemodialysis; however, the persistence of electrolyte abnormalities despite utilizing appropriate initial strategies requires further investigation. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 72-year-old male presented to the emergency department with weakness 2 months post-exploratory laparotomy with ileostomy for small bowel perforation complicated by intra-abdominal infection. The patient was treated for sepsis and imaging revealed intra-abdominal and abdominal wall abscesses. After drainage, recovery was complicated by treatment of refractory hypomagnesemia in the context of zinc supplementation. DISCUSSION: If initial electrolyte repletion measures do not provide the intended benefit, investigating secondary causes of refractory electrolyte abnormalities is necessary. While hypomagnesemia is one of the least common electrolyte derangements seen within the general acute care hospital setting, in facilities with relatively high volumes of bariatric or gastrointestinal surgical patients, keeping the phenomenon of zinc-induced hypomagnesemia in mind becomes more crucial due to its frequent use in those settings. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the effects of excess high-dose zinc supplementation in a patient without zinc deficiency in the postoperative period who developed treatment-resistant hypomagnesemia due to zinc-induced impairment of magnesium absorption as well as gastrointestinal and renal losses. LEARNING POINTS: Zinc supplementation can cause hypomagnesemia."

Nevertheless, the persistent use of these drugs has resulted in an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria and biofilm infections, highlighting the urgent need for alternative therapies. This study presents an approach for combating persistent bacterial and biofilm infections through the integration of biomimetic design and advanced nanotechnology. Inspired by the natural defense mechanisms of pollen grains and lotus leaves, we engineered zinc oxide spiky microparticles combined with tetracycline-loaded beads mimicking the structure of lotus leaf papillae. This biomimetic design exhibits a multifaceted antimicrobial strategy, leveraging hierarchical micro/nanostructures and the inherent antibacterial properties of their natural counterparts. ZnO microparticles, which mimic the morphology of pollen grains, provide topological cues to rupture adhered bacteria, whereas tetracycline beads, inspired by lotus leaf papillae, deliver a controlled release of antibiotics to target persistent bacteria. Using a synergistic multimodal approach, our biomimetic materials demonstrated exceptional efficacy in eradicating persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli infections, offering promising prospects for the development of advanced antibacterial therapies. This study not only underscores the importance of biomimicry in material design but also highlights the potential of integrating nature-inspired strategies with nanotechnology for biomedical applications.",

The improvement of crop cultivation techniques to promote the quality of the final product is imperative nowadays for ensuring sustainable and successive agricultural production, especially for medicinal and aromatic plant species. The present study examined the impacts of foliar application of iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) on Sideritis cypria plants grown in hydroponics. The spraying of Fe (1.79 mM and 10.79 mM) and Zn (1.74 mM and 10.43 mM Zn) was applied four times at 10-day intervals, and the effects on plant growth, plant physiology, antioxidant status and nutrient uptake were investigated. The applications of both the high Fe and Zn levels decreased the plant yield and dry matter content. The use of the high Fe levels, particularly, resulted in elevated oxidative stress, as indicated by the increased levels of lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide production and the increased peroxidase enzymatic activity. The application of the high Fe levels (10.79 mM Fe) also induced the plants' non-enzymatic antioxidant mechanisms and the total flavonoid content. All foliar applications increased the accumulation of sodium in the leaf tissue. The plants' calcium content was increased after the treatment with Zn, while the magnesium content was increased only when the high Zn level (10.43 mM Zn) was applied. Interestingly, the foliar application of both Zn and Fe had no effect on the build-up of zinc or iron content in the leaf tissue. Biofortification with minerals is a key approach to enhancing the biological quality and the nutritional value of plants, while its foliar application or application via different fertigation strategies needs to be evaluated either as single or as combined practices."

      "abstract": "Fungal plant pathogens cause considerable losses in yield and quality of field crops worldwide. Under specific environmental conditions, many fungi, such as Aspergillus spp., produce mycotoxins while colonizing their host, which accumulate in human and animal tissues, posing a serious threat to consumer health. Extensive use of fungicides in crop protection has stimulated the emergence of acquired drug resistance in some plant and human fungal pathogens. The use of metal compounds as antimicrobial agents offers an alternative strategy for managing potentially resistant toxigenic fungi and reducing the required dosage of specific drugs. We investigated the effect of zinc chloride (ZnCl2) on Aspergillus flavus infection and aflatoxin biosynthesis in cereal grains (wheat and maize) and legume crops (groundnut and chickpea). Following ZnCl2 treatment, quantitative PCR analysis showed a significant decrease in fungal DNA content in cereal grain and legume samples contaminated with A. flavus. Chitin content was dramatically reduced in A. flavus as a result of ZnCl2 treatment, suggesting that the zinc compound acts by inhibiting the synthesis of chitin, a fungal cell-wall component. Moreover, 5 days of treatment with 10 mM ZnCl2 reduced aflatoxin production by A. flavus in the tested crops by up to 43 %, and 20 and 40 mM ZnCl2 showed 87.4 to 99.7 % inhibition of toxin synthesis. These findings were supported by quantitative real-time PCR analysis, showing downregulation of key genes involved in the aflatoxin-biosynthesis pathway under ZnCl2 treatment. Our results provide evidence for antifungal and antimycotoxigenic effects of ZnCl2 against the filamentous fungus A. flavus. Future application of these findings may enable sustainable use of the compound in agricultural settings, while reducing potential concerns over exposure to high doses of fungicides that are harmful to the environment.",

The remediation effect of nHAP-CBC on Zn-contaminated soil was evaluated using batch experiments, and the materials were characterized using XRD, SEM, TEM, BET, and FTIR. These analyses confirmed the uniform dispersion of nHAP on the CBC to form a stable nHAP-CBC material. The results demonstrated that nHAP-CBC effectively converted Zn from an unstable state to a stable state, achieving a 65.79 % conversion rate and a 64.24 % stabilization rate during toxicity characteristic leaching after 45 days of treatment. nHAP-CBC was the most effective at fixing Zn and significantly increased the organic matter (OM) content, suggesting that OM played a key role in Zn fixation.

While ZnO has shown promise as an antibacterial agent in acne treatment, concerns over toxicity and non-selective bacterial killing remain. In this study we developed a hyaluronic acid-stabilized nano‑zinc oxide (HA-ZnO) formulation aimed at enhancing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of ZnO for acne treatment. HA-ZnO was synthesized through biomimetic mineralization. HA-ZnO targeted acne-prone areas, especially sebaceous glands, without skin penetration. HA-ZnO demonstrated selective antibacterial activity against C. acnes, exhibiting a killing efficacy more than 16 times greater than that against S. epidermidis. The HA coating also improved ZnO's stability in acidic conditions, mitigating potential toxicity and side effects. Additionally, the sustained release of Zn2+ promoted cell proliferation and migration, reducing sebum secretion, and exerting anti-inflammatory effects, supporting scar-free acne repair and preventing recurrence. In preclinical models, HA-ZnO outperformed erythromycin ointment in treating acne, with no toxicity observed in zebrafish and HET-CAM. A clinical trial further confirmed its efficacy in reducing acne lesions and redness, with high safety. These results highlight HA-ZnO as a promising therapeutic strategy for acne, combining potent antibacterial and skin-repairing effects with enhanced safety."

Metal nanoparticles with a biocompatible nature have been adopted for different biological applications. Thus, sequestering of α-synuclein monomer onto the metal nanoparticle will potentially impede Parkinson's onset/progression. In this study, interaction of α-synuclein with zinc oxide nanoparticle (ZnONP) having positive surface potential, and moderated ZnONP with negative surface-functional group(s), were explored. The interaction studies indicate that the NAC region interacts with the nanoparticle to sequester the monomeric protein into an amorphous aggregate, thus extending the lag phase of protein fibrillation. Interestingly, α-synuclein complexed with ZnONP exhibits remarkably lowered cytotoxicity against the SH-SY5Y cell in-vitro, compared to the treatment with only ZnONP interfaces or α-synuclein fibrils."

      "abstract": "Grade IV astrocytoma, also referred to as glioblastoma (GBM), is the most common type of glioma, accounting for over 60% of all brain tumors. It is still a fatal illness in spite of years of investigation and does not currently have a treatment. Thus, scientists and medical professionals are constantly trying to understand the molecular processes and heterogeneity of GBM as well as looking for new ways to improve treatment results. Numerous studies have indicated that nanomaterials, and more especially nanoparticles, offer a great deal of potential for killing cancer cells; as a result, they are being considered as a potential alternative cancer treatment. Several studies have demonstrated that ZnO NPs have shown specific cytotoxicity against cancer cells while leaving normal cells unharmed. In this study we aim to synthesize sodium doped zinc oxide NPs using zingerone in an environmentally friendly manner to evaluate their cytotoxic effects on U87 GBM cell line and normal HEK cell line and investigate the occurrence of apoptosis via apoptosis assay by flowcytometry and gene expression study of TP53 and related genes to apoptosis and cell cycle regulation pathways. It was demonstrated that Na-doped ZnO NPs had a significant cytotoxic effect on U87 cells while having significantly less effect on normal HEK cells. Na-doped ZnO NPs eliminated cancerous cells through apoptosis induction and possibly cell cycle regulation via up-regulation of TP53, PTEN, BAX, P21 and down-regulation of Bcl2. The unique physicochemical properties of nanoparticles turn them into fascinating agents to treat GBM. Hence, the necessity of exploring the vast, yet unknown field of nanoparticles potentials cannot be over looked.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Levodopa administration has been the standard therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) and prolonged treatment is associated with levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). This study aimed to identify the effects of zinc (Zn) supplements on LID and to explore the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were injected with 6-OHDA at medial forebrain bundle, followed by daily levodopa injection to induce LID. The mice were supplemented with Zn of 0, 0.3, 1.2, or 2.4 mg/kg for 4 weeks. RESULTS: In the LID mice, Zn supplements restored tissue Zn levels and alleviated global, forelimb, and orolingual abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs). Signaling pathway assessments showed that Zn supplements significantly reduced expressions of phosphorylated glutamate receptor 1 (p-GluR1) and phosphorylation levels of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK/ERK). Correlations between the AIMs score, p-ERK, and tissue Zn levels were established. In addition, Zn supplements reduced numbers of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive cells and compensatory tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive cells. These alleviating effects of Zn supplements were strictly regulated in a dose dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Appropriate doses of Zn supplements alleviated AIMs in the LID mouse model, potentially via impeding ERK phosphorylation, inhibiting astrocyte activation, and attenuating striatal compensation of TH positive cells.",

      "abstract": "Bone defects caused by trauma, tumors, or infections pose significant challenges to clinical treatment because of the complex pathological microenvironment they create. Elevated levels of inflammatory factors and reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the defect site disrupt the bone immune microenvironment, impeding bone regeneration. Concurrently, the vascular damage frequently associated with bone defects leads to hypoxia, further complicating therapeutic efforts. Although bone grafting remains a primary clinical approach, its efficacy is limited by these adverse conditions. In this study, a ZnO-CuS/F127 nanozyme hydrogel with multiple enzymatic activities was manufactured for bone defect repair via the modulation of the bone immune microenvironment and the promotion of osteo-/angiogenesis, which was accomplished via the encapsulation of ZnO-CuS nanoflowers synthesized via calcination into the F127 hydrogel matrix. ZnO-CuS bimetallic nanoenzymes exhibit robust catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase-like activities, enabling effective scavenging of diverse ROS species in vitro. In cellular assays, ZnO-CuS/F127 protected bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells [bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)] from ROS-induced cytotoxicity and promoted macrophage polarization toward the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, thus modulating the bone immune microenvironment. The ZnO-CuS/F127 hydrogel demonstrated potent proangiogenic and pro-osteogenic effects, attributed to its ability to upregulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway while inhibiting the NF-κB pathway in BMSCs, as confirmed by RNA sequencing. In vivo, the hydrogel exhibited exceptional hemostatic performance and facilitated bone defect repair in mouse hemorrhage and rat bone defect models while maintaining high biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity. This study highlights the use of the ZnO-CuS/F127 nanozyme hydrogel as a promising therapeutic strategy for bone defect repair. By modulating the immune microenvironment and promoting angiogenesis and osteogenesis, this multifunctional hydrogel offers innovative insights and a potential clinical solution for addressing the multifaceted challenges of bone regeneration."

      "abstract": "A critical barrier to commercializing aqueous Zn-metal batteries lies in the dual challenges of dendritic Zn growth and parasitic side reactions at the anode/electrolyte interface. Here, this study presents a front-end design optimization strategy for Zn metal anodes (ZMAs), combining surface laser texturing with alloying treatment to stabilize the interfacial chemistry. Specifically, laser texturing creates a geometrically ordered microstructure on the Zn surface, while subsequent chemical permeation induces the in situ transformation of this microstructured layer into a CuZn5 alloy, forming the LT-Zn@CuZn5 anode. The geometrically ordered alloy coating homogenizes the electronic filed distribution across the zinc surface and enhances corrosion resistance. Thereby, the LT-Zn@CuZn5 anode demonstrated optimized electrochemical reversibility, sustaining over 3000 cycles at 3 mA cm-2/1 mAh cm-2. This performance translates into a high improvement in the cycling behavior of the assembled Zn||I2 soft pack battery, which acquired an initial capacity of 225.8 mAh g-1 and retained 79.1% after 4000 cycles. In contrast, the counterpart employing untreated Zn foil started with a lower initial capacity of 180.7 mAh g-1 and failed after less than 478 cycles. The demonstrated effective approach improves the front-end design strategy of ZMAs and contributes to the development of dendrite-free ZMAs."

This study evaluated the impact of recovery alone or with zinc (Zn) supplementation on Cd-induced testicular toxicity. A total of 42 pubertal male Wistar rats were divided into seven groups of six rats each. The control group (1) received NaCl (0.9%). Groups 2, 3, and 4 were treated with Cd 10 μg/kg/d by intraperitoneal injection for 1, 2, and 3 months respectively. Group 5 received Cd for 3 months with a recovery period of 1 month; Group 6 was exposed to Cd for 3 months, followed by a 1-month recovery period combined with Zn supplementation. (0.5 mg/kg/d). The last group was treated with zinc at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day for one month. The results showed decreased body weight, testicular and epididymal weight, testicular dimensions, and sperm parameters, along with Cd accumulation in the testes. Cd caused testicular damage and reduced serum testosterone levels, with more pronounced effects in the 3-month treatment group. Recovery alone did not significantly reverse Cd's toxic effects, whereas Zn supplementation mitigated most of the damage. Recovery combined with Zn supplementation was more effective in correcting Cd-induced testicular toxicity than recovery alone.",

      "abstract": "As industrialization and societal development accelerate, various organisms, including humans, are exposed to environmental hazards, such as zinc (Zn) and high-fat diet (HFD). These widespread exposures pose significant threats to public health; however, the combined effects and underlying mechanisms of these environmental factors on lipotoxicity remain unclear. In this study, the yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) was used as a model to investigate the impact of different Zn levels and HFD coexposure on hepatic lipotoxicity. The results indicated that low concentrations of Zn (L-Zn) significantly reduced hepatic lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress compared to HFD-only treatment, while high concentrations of Zn (H-Zn) exacerbated these effects. Mechanistically, L-Zn alleviated ER stress by scavenging H2O2 and O2•- within the ER via the MTF-1/GPx7 pathway. Glutathione peroxidase 7 (GPx7), an ER-resident antioxidant enzyme, played a crucial role in mitigating ER stress and lipotoxicity, with metal-responsive transcription factor 1 (MTF-1) identified as its regulator. This study is the first to demonstrate the dual role of Zn in hepatic lipotoxicity, revealing the Zn2+/MTF-1/GPx7 axis as a key modulator of ER stress and lipid metabolism. These findings highlight the importance of considering combined environmental exposures in public health and environmental risk assessments.",

      "abstract": "Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, is used to treat psychological diseases. However, it's use carries common side effects. Those include weight gain, dyslipidemia, elevated glucose levels, and disrupted oxidative balance. We aimed to test the effect of zinc coadministration to lessen metabolic disturbances, inflammation and oxidative stress in a rat model. Four treatment groups (n = 6) were involved in this investigation. Group 1 was the control group (received no intervention). Group 2 received olanzapine (10 mg/kg, p.o.; daily) for six weeks, whereas Groups 3 and 4 received 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg of zinc sulphate (ZnSO4,p.o.; daily) respectively, in addition to olanzapine (10 mg/kg p.o.; daily). Following treatment completion, group 2 showed increased levels of stress markers (GSSG, MDA, and NO) and impaired levels of antioxidant markers (CAT, SOD, and GSH). Further, a strong positive correlation between insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and IL-6, TNF-α, and MDA of liver. Insulin resistance is a possible manifestation of the oxidative stress burden and the widespread inflammatory environment. In groups 3 and 4, however, ZnSO4 recovered each of these markers in a dose-dependent manner. Improvements were also noted in other homeostatic markers, such as taurine, coenzyme Q10, ascorbic acid, and vitamin E. Remarkably, in both combination groups, there was a significant improvement in all metabolic indicators of dyslipidemia (triglycerides, total cholesterol) and insulin resistance index. The biochemical study and the histological assessment of the liver slices agreed with the results. Thus, the results clearly suggest that Zinc supplementation can significantly improve oxidative stress, inflammation, metabolic perturbation (dyslipidemia and insulin resistance), and liver injury caused by olanzapine in Albino rats.",

      "abstract": "The mounting accumulation of spent alkaline batteries (SABs) elicits concerns over both environmental threats and the recycling industry's profitability, closely tied to the chemical reactions in manganese-based waste treatment. Herein, we design an acid-modulated phase-reconstruction strategy for sustainable recovery of manganese oxides from SABs, where moderate proton participation facilitates the preformation of MnOOH intermediates before the initial transformation to ramsdellite-MnO2 (RM-R, orthorhombic) and the final conversion to pyrolusite-MnO2 (RM-β, tetragonal) nanomaterials. This rarely reported metastable RM-R phase features a unique tunneled framework (1 × 2 edge-shared MnO6 octahedra) enabling reversible H+/Zn2+ (de)intercalation, though its traditional synthesis remains challenging due to thermodynamic instability. First-principles calculations reveal that RM-R possesses lower Zn2+ diffusion barriers (0.44 eV) than RM-β (0.99 eV), consistent with its superior Zn2+ storage performance. Moreover, the higher specific surface area enables the RM-R cathode with a battery-supercapacitor hybrid storage behavior, which delivers remarkable capacity (214.9 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1) and long cycling stability (98% retention after 1000 cycles), outperforming most reported MnO2-based cathodes. This low-acid regeneration protocol (4 mL of HCl/1.85 g of waste) paves a sustainable way for closed-loop battery recycling and clarifies the structure-property relationships in metastable manganese oxides."

      "abstract": "Background: Traditional programmed cell death, including ferroptosis, cuproptosis, and apoptosis, has demonstrated excellent anti-tumor effects and declared their complete mechanisms, however, the zinc ion-mediated tumor inhibiting mechanisms remain insufficiently explored. In this study, a self-generated oxygen nanocatalytic system (ZnO@COF@EM, ZCE) was developed to stimulate cascade amplified effect (CAE) of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation leading to Znproptosis. The underlying Znproptosis mechanism to disrupt mitochondrial (Mito) metabolism was also investigated. Methods: Specifically, the principle of Znproptosis caused by accumulated zinc and ROS, which served as key factors, was declared through western blot analysis and genetic testing. The mechanism of generated ROS (·OH and 1O2) under NIR irradiation by ZCE was detected by UV scanning curves, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images, and density functional analysis. The injury condition of Fe-S protein of mitochondria metabolism, which triggered Znproptosis with FDX2/LIAS pathway by zinc and ROS, was examined by PCR test and MTT assay. Notably, a Mito-targeting strategy for ZCE was proposed by using molecular docking technology, wherein Zn2+ was recognized by zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) with the Mito. Results: ZCE, along with CAE, produced abundant ROS (2.42-time more than control group). At the quantum chemical level, the CAE mechanism was associated with a narrower highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gap and increased electronic energy motion within ZCE, which prolonged the excited triplet state (ETS). At the gene level, Znproptosis was achieved by regulating FDX2 and ZIP7 proteins to damage Fe-S protein. The cell cycle was interrupted by Chk2/Cdc25C/Cdc2 and Chk2/p21/Cyclin B1 pathways, leading to the arrest of G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle and inhibition of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Moreover, Znproptosis induced by overloading zinc ions and ROS resulted in a significant antitumor effect (up to 83.81%). Conclusion: Hence, the research reveals a detailed Znproptosis mechanism in nanocatalytic system. Through regulating FDX2/LIAS pathway, Znproptosis could improve the death rate of mitochondria by decreasing the production of Fe-S protein, contributing to advancements in the field of antitumor therapy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: The rapid advancement of nanotechnology has opened new avenues for biomedical applications, particularly in antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer therapies. Green synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) using plant extracts offers an eco-friendly and biocompatible alternative to traditional chemical methods. This study explores the synthesis of ZnO-NPs using Syzygium aromaticum (clove) bud extract (CBE) and evaluates their multifaceted biomedical potential, including anticancer, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties. METHODS: Clove bud extract-zinc oxide nanoparticles (CBE-ZnO-NPs) were synthesized and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyses to confirm their size, morphology, elemental composition, and surface properties. The anticancer efficacy was tested against tongue carcinoma (HNO-97) cells using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Antibacterial activity was assessed against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus, while anti-inflammatory potential was evaluated using a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7). RESULTS: The SEM analysis confirmed a non-uniform shape of ZnO-NPs, while FTIR revealed functional groups responsible for stabilization and bioactivity. DLS measurements indicated an average particle size of 249.8 nm with a zeta potential of -3.38 mV, ensuring moderate colloidal stability. BET analysis demonstrated a high porosity (30.039 m²/g) and a mean particle size of 19.52 nm. CBE-ZnO-NPs exhibited moderate anticancer activity against tongue carcinoma cells (IC50 > 100 µg/mL), potent antibacterial activity (MIC = 62.5-125 μg/mL), and anti-inflammatory effects (IC50 = 69.3 µg/mL). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential of CBE-ZnO-NPs as a promising multi-functional nanomaterial with potent antibacterial, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties. The findings pave the way for further exploration of ZnO-based nanotherapeutics in biomedical applications, particularly in cancer therapy, infection control, and inflammatory disorders.",

      "abstract": "The development of sustainable functional wood-based materials for advanced photonic, optical, and energy-harvesting applications is a topic of great priority and scientific interest. Owing to its inherent piezoactivity and photoconductivity, zinc oxide (ZnO) can be of help for all these applications. While previously used for wood-based piezoelectric nanogenerators, its use for enabling wood with photoconductive properties has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we introduce an innovative method to produce ZnO-wood hybrids based on atomic layer deposition (ALD), a technique so far underrepresented in the field of wood functionalization. By a studied combination of ALD, customized sample geometry, structure-retaining delignification, and careful selection of the drying method, we obtained a homogeneous functionalization of a bulk wood scaffold with layers of nanocrystalline ZnO. This approach allowed us to achieve control over the homogeneity, distribution, and coating thickness of the oxide layer. The micro- and nanostructure of the resulting hybrids were investigated by electron microscopy as well as by X-ray diffraction and scattering. The ZnO-wood hybrids show an anisotropic piezoelectric response due to the natural structure of the wood. Moreover, we demonstrate the use of ZnO-functionalized wood for the fabrication of bulk (photo)conductive wood. Upon irradiation with UV light, a significant decrease in resistivity is observed, which increases again upon removal of UV light. Finally, we used the hybrids to fabricate a ZnO-wood replica by thermal removal of the cellulose scaffold. This treatment leaves behind a detailed inorganic wood replica down to the smallest open accessible features such as micrometer-sized wood pits."

This study assessed the effectiveness of consuming zinc-biofortified wheat flour on growth and zinc-related morbidity among adolescent girls (10-16 years; N = 517) and children (1-5 years; N = 517) living in rural north-west Pakistan. METHODS: In this double-blind, cluster-randomised controlled effectiveness trial, 486 households received either zinc-biofortified or control wheat flour for 25 weeks. Anthropometric measurements and lung function tests (LFTs) were performed at the beginning, middle, and endline. Data on the incidence and duration of respiratory tract infection (RTI) and diarrhoea in the preceding two weeks were collected fortnightly. Analyses included baseline-adjusted linear mixed models for continuous outcomes and Pearson's chi-square for categorical data. RESULTS: At a zinc differential of 3.7 mg/kg for adolescent girls provided by zinc-biofortified wheat flour, the intervention had no significant effect on height or weight. For children, head circumference was significantly greater in the biofortified group at endline (control 48.47 ± 2.03 cm vs. intervention 48.76 ± 1.82 cm; p = 0.003), with no differences in other anthropometric parameters. Towards the end of the trial, a lower incidence of RTIs was reported in the intervention arm compared to the control arm for both children (week 26: control 27.4% vs. intervention 17.6%, p = 0.036) and adolescent girls (week 24: control 19.3% vs. intervention 11.5%, p = 0.037; week 26: control 14.5% vs. intervention 6.1%, p = 0.014). When the longitudinal prevalence (cumulative days of sickness as a percentage of total days) of RTI was considered, no treatment effects were observed. No benefits of treatment were reported for diarrhoea or LFT. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of zinc-biofortified wheat flour for 25 weeks did not have a significant effect on the growth of adolescent girls but modestly improved head circumference in children. Longer-term interventions are needed to monitor changes in functional outcomes with the national scale-up of zinc-biofortified wheat varieties.",

Additionally, it is established that dietary zinc can enhance sleep quality. Despite these insights, the interplay between zinc supplementation and sleep patterns, and their combined effect on CKD progression, is still not fully understood. METHODS: This population-based cohort study used UK Biobank data (2006-2010) and employed cox regression models to assess the associations between dietary zinc supplementation, sleep patterns, and their combined effects on CKD. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 14.8 years, 22,384 new CKD cases were identified. Zinc supplementation reduced CKD risk in individuals with poor (HR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.50-0.98) and moderate (HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81-0.98) sleep patterns but not in those with healthy sleep (HR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.89-1.14). A significant interaction between zinc supplementation and sleep patterns was observed (p = 0.017), with sensitivity analyses confirming the results. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate a significant association between dietary zinc supplementation and reduced CKD risk, especially in individuals with poor sleep patterns. Further studies are needed to explore zinc supplementation as a targeted intervention for those at higher CKD risk due to poor sleep."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In radiation therapy, a major challenge is the lack of visualization of radiation beams as they target patients. To address this, we developed a wearable fabric incorporating silver-doped zinc sulfide (ZnS(Ag)) scintillator powder, designed for real-time monitoring of beams on the curved surfaces of patients during proton therapy. METHODS: The ZnS(Ag)-incorporated wearable fabric was created by mixing ZnS(Ag) with a two-part silicone adhesive, applying this mixture to a cotton fabric, and allowing it to solidify. This process produced a scintillating fabric capable of high-intensity imaging of surface proton beams when worn by a patient. To assess its performance, we also fabricated a flexible ZnS(Ag) sheet by applying the mixture onto a plastic plate for solidification, which was then peeled off. RESULTS: Using the ZnS(Ag)-incorporated wearable fabric in combination with a cooled CMOS camera, we successfully imaged scintillating areas during proton beam irradiation under dark conditions in the therapy room. The fabric also effectively revealed scintillating areas when placed on a black mannequin. While the relative detection efficiency of the developed ZnS(Ag)-incorporated flexible scintillator sheet was one-third that of the ZnS(Ag) plate or a plastic scintillator for alpha particles, its light output was 1.9 times higher than that of the plastic scintillator. CONCLUSION: The ZnS(Ag)-incorporated wearable fabric's flexibility makes it particularly suitable for surface beam imaging in proton therapy, suggesting promising potential for this technology in therapeutic imaging applications."

      "abstract": "Tire wear particles (TWP) are potential pollutants of emerging concern. Therefore, the EU is set to regulate the TWP emissions under the new Euro 7 emission standard. For Germany it is estimated that up to 20,000 t TWP reach the aquatic environment. Main transport pathways are via road runoff and separate sewage systems. Studies indicate that, apart from ecotoxicological concerns, the negatively charged surface of TWP can adsorb heavy metals like Cr, Ni, Zn, Cd and Pb, potentially deteriorating the chemical water quality of rivers. As rivers usually undergo a salt gradient from their source to the sea this may change the adsorption of heavy metals. We investigated the influence of salinity on the heavy metal adsorption on TWP using water samples from the Freiberger Mulde (Saxony, Germany), enriched with NaCl to simulate the salinity representative of different rivers in the Elbe catchment area, and additional water samples (Elbe, Saale, Bode, Schlenze). The adsorption of Cd and Zn appear to be highly salt-dependent. Above 12 mg L-1 Cl-, no significant adsorption was observed. It is assumed that both metals form [MCl4]2- complexes which are repelled from the negative surface of TWP. The potential in building these complexes is high enough to dissolve previously adsorbed Cd from TWP. These findings are important for assessing water quality of river systems as well as runoff filtration and water retention systems. In winter, for instance, when de-icing salt is applied, Cd and Zn bound on TWP may be mobilized entering water systems."

Aquaculture wastewater was treated with varying doses of Ag NPs and ZnO NPs across the following six groups: Group 1 (0.05 mg Ag NPs/L), Group 2 (1 mg ZnO NPs/L), Group 3 (0.05 mg Ag NPs/L + 1 mg ZnO NPs/L), Group 4 (0.025 Ag NPs/L + 0.5 mg ZnO NPs/L), Group 5 (0.1 mg Ag NPs/L + 2 mg ZnO NPs/L), and a control group. Water quality, microbial loads and nanomaterial concentrations were assessed over ten days. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed average particle sizes of 102.5 nm for Ag NPs and 110.27 nm for ZnO NPs. The removal efficiencies of NH4-N were over 98% across treatment groups. In addition, COD removal efficiencies were 33.33%, 68.82%, 49.59%, 61.49%, and 37.65%. The log-reductions in aerobic plate counts for the nanoparticle-treated wastewater were 1.191, 1.947, 1.133, 1.071, and 0.087, compared to a reduction of 0.911 in untreated wastewater. Silver concentrations ranged from 0.0079 to 0.0192 mg/L, while zinc concentrations ranged from 0.3040 to 0.9740 mg/L, indicating that ZnO-NPs represent a sustainable treatment method for aquaculture wastewater."

While it is known that their catalytic performance is determined by their microstructure and thus by their preparation, the influence of an important but commonly used calcination treatment during nanoparticle preparation on their properties is often overlooked. Herein, structural and morphological changes during the calcination of Pd(NO3)2/ZnO are studied systematically by performing in situ heating experiments mimicking typical preparation conditions, by employing environmental scanning transmission electron microscopy. The effect of different calcination parameters on Pd(NO3)2/ZnO is explored and guidance to enhance control over the preparation of small supported nanoparticles is provided. It is shown that a calcination treatment of Pd(NO3)2/ZnO between 200 and 400 °C for 15-120 min is ideally suited to obtain particles smaller than 4 nm with a narrow size distribution."

      "abstract": "UVR-related skin damage is common in daily life. Excessive sunlight exposure, particularly in response to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, can have adverse effects on the skin and can even induce photosensitive skin diseases and skin malignancies. UVB exposure leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the skin, resulting in cell damage and inflammation. Furthermore, it directly inhibits the synthesis of collagen in skin fibroblasts, contributing to collagen degradation and subsequently causing skin aging, wrinkles, and erythema. To address this issue, our study introduces a biomaterial-based treatment plan for repairing UVB-induced photodamaged skin. We designed a sodium hyaluronate microneedle patch containing a hardystonite bioceramic (ZnCS/MN) with anti-ROS/inflammation/collagen degradation functions to deliver bioactive Zn2+ and SiO3 2- ions in situ to photodamaged skin areas. In addition, the cytological mechanism of ZnCS action was explored to explore the possibilities of its application in more areas. This study reveals the therapeutic potential of ZnCS for a variety of negative effects caused by photodamage. Owing to its advantages in preparation, storage, and transportation, ZnCS/MN has shown promise for clinical application in treating photodamaging."

      "abstract": "Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient for plants, but excessive concentrations induce cytotoxicity. As one of the world's primary crops, rice's response mechanisms to Zn toxicity remain poorly understood. In this study, we characterized a rice mutant, NG3-6, which exhibited enhanced sensitivity to Zn toxicity compared to the wild type (WT). At Zn concentrations of 40 μM and above, NG3-6 displayed severe toxicity symptoms, including reduced primary root length, plant height, and dry weight, whereas the WT plants maintained normal growth until Zn concentrations exceeded 400 μM. The mutant demonstrated a higher Zn uptake capacity in roots, leading to increased Zn accumulation across all tissues. This higher Zn accumulation was correlated with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Zn toxicity induced the accumulation of oxidative stress-related metabolites, such as L-proline, glutathione, and water-soluble sugars, in both the mutant and WT. However, NG3-6 showed distinct metabolic alterations in response to high Zn treatment, including significant accumulation of certain metabolites associated with the pentose phosphate pathway, amine biosynthesis, and benzoic acid-related pathways, concurrent with reduced flavonoid biosynthesis. These findings advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying root adaptive strategies to Zn toxicity in plants."

      "abstract": "SLC13A5 encodes a citrate transporter highly expressed in the brain and is important for regulating intra- and extracellular citrate levels. Mutations in this gene cause rare infantile epilepsy characterized by lifelong seizures, developmental delays, behavioral deficits, poor motor progression, and language impairments. SLC13A5 individuals respond poorly to treatment options; yet drug discovery programs are limited due to a paucity of animal models that phenocopy human symptoms. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create loss-of-function mutations in slc13a5a and slc13a5b, the zebrafish paralogs to human SLC13A5. slc13a5 mutant larvae showed cognitive dysfunction and sleep disturbances, consistent with SLC13A5 individuals. These mutants also exhibited fewer neurons and a concomitant increase in apoptosis across the optic tectum, a region important for sensory processing. Further, slc13a5 mutants displayed hallmark features of epilepsy, including an imbalance in glutamatergic and GABAergic excitatory-inhibitory gene expression, increased fosab expression, disrupted neurometabolism, and neuronal hyperexcitation as measured in vivo by extracellular field recordings and live calcium imaging. Mechanistically, we tested the involvement of NMDA signaling and zinc chelation in slc13a5 mutant epilepsy-like phenotypes. Slc13a5 protein co-localizes with excitatory NMDA receptors in wild-type zebrafish and NMDA receptor expression is upregulated in the brain of slc13a5 mutant larvae. Additionally, low levels of zinc are found in the plasma membrane of slc13a5 mutants. NMDA receptor suppression and ZnCl2 treatment in slc13a5 mutant larvae rescued neurometabolic and hyperexcitable calcium events, as well as behavioral defects. These data provide empirical evidence in support of the hypothesis that excess extracellular citrate over-chelates the zinc ions needed to regulate NMDA receptor function, leading to sustained channel opening and an exaggerated excitatory response that manifests as seizures. These data show the utility of slc13a5 mutant zebrafish for studying SLC13A5 epilepsy and open new avenues for drug discovery."

In this work, we have prepared a superhydrophobic coating using green and environmentally friendly chitosan, nanozinc oxide, γ-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (KH550), and stearic acid. The prepared cotton fabric showed remarkable superhydrophobic properties. Under simulated sunlight, the surface temperature of the superhydrophobic cotton fabric can increase to 50 °C. The superhydrophobic surface sustained its superhydrophobic property after at least 80 tape peeling tests, 50 occurrences of sandpaper friction, 3.5 h of washing, and 24 h of high-temperature heat treatment. Besides, the coating can be utilized for oil-water separation and is reusable. The oil-water separation effectiveness of the coating reaches more than 95%. Therefore, this inexpensive and ecofriendly nanozinc oxide/chitosan-based superhydrophobic coating has remarkable application potential."

      "abstract": "There is a clear relationship between osteoarthritis (OA) and micronutrients. Excessive accumulation of micronutrients may play a negative role in aggravating the symptoms of OA. This study aims to sort out the causal relationship between micronutrients (zinc, copper, magnesium, vitamins A, C, E, D, B6, and B12, folic acid, iron, carotene, selenium, calcium, and potassium) and OA. This study used Mendelian randomization (MR) to combining the causal relationship between micronutrients and the risk of OA. Micronutrient-related variants were extracted from a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) database of circulating micronutrients in European populations. Outcome data were from the FINNGEN meta-analysis of OA in participants of European ancestry from the FinnGen Biobank in Finland. The primary analysis was performed using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, and a series of sensitivity analyses and multi-dimensionality analyses were conducted to detect possible violations of the MR assumptions. This study used the IVW method to analyze the causal relationship between 15 micronutrients and OA. The results showed that copper (P = 0.535), selenium (P = 0.463), folic acid (P = 0.664), carotene (P = 0.706), potassium (P = 0.839), vitamin D (P = 0.941), vitamin C (P = 0.928), vitamin B12 (P = 0.859), iron (P = 0.496), vitamin E (P = 0.678), magnesium (P = 0.934), vitamin B6 (P = 0.027), calcium (P = 0.743), and vitamin A (P = 0.368) had no significant causal relationship with OA. Among them, vitamin B6 showed P < 0.05 in the pleiotropy test, indicating the presence of pleiotropy. In contrast, zinc exhibited a significant causal relationship with OA (P < 0.001, OR 95% CI = 1.044 [1.021-1.067]), with sensitivity analyses further validating the robustness and reliability of this finding. This study reveals a causal relationship between zinc and OA, identifying zinc as a risk factor for OA. It provides evidence of causality between zinc and OA, offering novel insights for clinical research, diagnosis, and treatment of OA."

In this study, a novel zinc porphyrin, Por-TR, was fabricated by incorporating thiophene as a donor and introducing electron acceptors on both sides to expand the conjugation. The presence of multiple flexible chains in the molecular structure of Por-TR inhibits π-π stacking, which allows it to form J nanoaggregates when coassembled with DSPE-PEG2000, demonstrating maximum absorption at approximately 808 nm. These Por-TR NPs provide NIR-II fluorescence/PA dual-modal signals for imaging and serve as a combined PTT/PDT therapeutic agent, making them a suitable multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform. To further improve their therapeutic effects, we embedded a thermosensitive NO donor, BNN6, in the Por-TR nanosystem to achieve combined PDT/PTT/NO therapy. Intravenous injection of Por-TR-NO NPs into 4T1 tumor-bearing mice enabled the accurate observation of tumor location via NIR-II fluorescence/PA dual-modal imaging. In vivo therapy results show that the Por-TR-NO NPs exhibited remarkable antitumor efficacy in combined PTT/PDT/NO therapy, which was triggered by an 808 nm laser. Overall, this nanoplatform offers a versatile approach to cancer diagnosis and treatment.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematological malignancy. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) and Luteolin are commonly used to fight cancer. In this study, we synthesized a new complex: zinc oxide nanoparticles-luteolin (ZnONPs-Lut) and aimed to investigate its effects on cell death in the AML cell line (MOLM-13) in vitro and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: We assessed cell viability, quantified changes in gene expression using real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), and measured changes in ferrous (Fe2+) content, glutathione (GSH) content, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) levels following treatment with different concentrations of MOLM-13 cells with different concentrations of ZnONPs-Lut. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression levels of ACSL4, GPX4, FTH1, and SLC7A11, while the cell morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Meanwhile, the effect of Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), a ferroptosis inhibitor, on the expression of the aforementioned ferroptosis-related proteins and cell morphology was evaluated. RESULTS: The results showed that ZnONPs-Lut was able to significantly inhibit the proliferation of MOLM-13 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Additionally, it increased the concentrations of Fe2+ and MDA, reduced the expression levels of GSH and MMP, and induced ROS generation. Furthermore, it also enhanced the expression of ACSL4 protein while decreasing the expression of GPX4, FTH1, and SLC7A11 proteins. Notably, Fer-1 was able to significantly restrain the changes in protein levels and mitochondrial morphology damage induced by ZnONPs-Lut after its action on cells. CONCLUSION: ZnONPs-Lut inhibits the proliferation of MOLM-13 cells, likely through promoting the cellular ferroptosis signaling pathway. These findings suggest that ZnONPs-Lut could be a potential therapeutic approach for AML.",

We have developed a near-infrared (NIR) photosensitizing dye, Zn6PTPc, for NIR-photochemical internalization (PCI) to achieve gentle and efficient endosomal escape and delivery of antibody drugs, which are known to have high targeting ability but low intracellular activity, into target cancer cells. Zn6PTPc allowed longer wavelengths to be used to achieve higher singlet oxygen generation efficiency by the molecular design based on a distorted π-electron system. The system effectively introduced immunotoxins into cells to significantly inhibit tumor tissue growth. The developed potent NIR photosensitizers facilitated NIR-PCI with high tumor-targeting ability."

      "abstract": "Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) have gained significant attention in cancer therapy due to their unique physical and chemical properties, particularly in treating gastrointestinal (GI) cancers such as gastric, colorectal, and hepatocellular carcinoma. These nanoparticles generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon entering cancer cells, causing oxidative stress that leads to cellular damage, DNA fragmentation, and apoptosis. ZnO-NPs affect the expression of key proteins involved in apoptosis, including p53, Bax, and Bcl-2, which regulate cell cycle arrest and programmed cell death. Additionally, ZnO-NPs can reduce mitochondrial membrane potential, further enhancing apoptosis in cancer cells. Furthermore, ZnO-NPs inhibit cancer cell proliferation by interfering with cell cycle progression. They reduce levels of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), leading to cell cycle arrest. ZnO-NPs also exhibit anti-metastatic properties by inhibiting the migration and invasion of cancer cells through modulation of signaling pathways that affect cell adhesion and cytoskeletal dynamics. The efficacy of ZnO-NPs in overcoming chemotherapy resistance has been demonstrated by their ability to reduce the IC50 values of chemotherapeutic agents, making cancer cells more susceptible to drug-induced cell death. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms by which ZnO-NPs exert anticancer effects in GI cancers, focusing on apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and metastasis inhibition, while also highlighting the current limitations in translating these findings into effective clinical treatments."

This study evaluates the antibacterial efficacy of green-synthesized zinc oxide NPs (ZnO-NPs) derived from Garcinia mangostana leaf extract against both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria relevant to poultry health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a completely randomized design, six treatment groups were tested: Positive control (PC) (tetracycline, 2.5 mg/mL), negative control (NC) (HCl 0.1 N + distilled water), and ZnO-NPs at concentrations of 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 mg/mL. The antimicrobial activity was assessed using the agar well diffusion method, measuring inhibition zones against Escherichia coli, S. Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus plantarum. RESULTS: The positive control demonstrated the most significant inhibition zones across all bacterial strains. ZnO-NPs exhibited dose-dependent antibacterial activity, with maximum inhibition zones recorded as 18.58 mm for E. coli, 17.09 mm for S. Typhimurium, and 17.41 mm for S. aureus at the highest concentration (10 mg/mL). However, the antibacterial activity against L. plantarum was less pronounced, with a maximum inhibition zone of 9.93 mm. These findings indicate selective toxicity of ZnO-NPs, favoring pathogenic over non-pathogenic strains. CONCLUSION: Green-synthesized ZnO-NPs using G. mangostana leaf extract demonstrate promising antibacterial properties against poultry pathogens. Their selective action highlights potential applications as eco-friendly feed additives to improve poultry health and mitigate pathogenic risks."

Conventional treatments often fail to prevent its progression. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of Tithonia diversifolia zinc oxide nanoparticle emulsion (TDNP) in mitigating DN by enhancing antioxidant and immunomodulatory mechanisms. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of TDNP on oxidative stress markers, inflammation, and insulin activity in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DN rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats (n = 24) were divided into four groups: control (saline), positive control (0.1% zinc oxide suspension), treatment (TDNP at 100 mg/kg body weight), and comparison (quercetin at 5 mg/kg body weight). DN was induced using STZ and nicotinamide. Blood glucose, creatinine, urea, gamma-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were assessed. Oxidative stress markers (superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione peroxidase [GPx]), inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α), and immunohistochemical indicators (anti-insulin, interferon-gamma [IFN-γ]) were measured. Data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis tests. RESULTS: TDNP treatment significantly reduced blood glucose, creatinine, urea, γ-GT, and TNF-α levels (p ≤ 0.05), while increasing SOD, GPx, and anti-insulin levels compared with the positive control. Histopathological analysis showed decreased necrosis and inflammation in pancreatic and renal tissues. Immunohistochemistry revealed enhanced anti-insulin and reduced IFN-γ expression in TDNP-treated rats, indicating improved immune regulation and oxidative stress mitigation. CONCLUSION: TDNP demonstrates potent antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, effectively improving glucose metabolism and kidney function in DN. These findings highlight TDNP as a promising therapeutic agent for managing DN."

We aimed to prospectively investigate the serum levels of both elements in pediatric cancers. Children <18 years with newly diagnosed cancers were eligible. Data regarding demographics, histopathological diagnoses, tumor sites, disease extent, treatments given and outcomes were recorded. Serum samples were obtained at diagnosis and in the 3-4 months after diagnosis to determine the serum concentrations of zinc and selenium using \"inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry\" (ICP-MS) method. Serum levels were compared to normal references and also in the subgroups according to tumor types, tumor sites and disease extent. Eighty-one children were included (Male/female: 50/31, median age 7.5-years). Twenty-five patients had lymphomas and 56 had solid tumors. For all patients, median serum levels of zinc and selenium were 69.5 mcg/dL and 114.3 mcg/L, respectively, which were comparable to normal reference values. In patients with lymphomas, mean and median initial zinc levels were significantly lower compared to solid tumors, which increased following treatment. No significant difference was detected in initial selenium concentrations of all patients and also in the subgroups. In the 3.-4. months following treatment, selenium levels decreased significantly in solid tumors. No significant difference was detected in the survival rates according to Zn and Se levels. Lower zinc levels at diagnosis in lymphomas was remarkable. The decline in Se levels after treatment may reflect the selenophilic nature of solid tumors and could also be linked to reduced appetite and dietary intake. Suppression of hepatic biosynthesis of selenoprotein by some chemotherapeutics might also contribute to diminished selenium levels after treatment. Further studies are needed to explore the implications of deficiencies in both elements."

Experiments were conducted for 2 years during the Rabi and Kharif rice seasons at 339 on-farm locations in five districts and four agroclimatic zones of Odisha state in eastern India to study the management of Zn in rice nurseries and the transplanted crop. At each location, five treatment plots were established in which nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were applied to rice following site-specific nutrient management as guided by Rice Crop Manager (RCM), a web-based tool. In the three treatments, the rice nursery was treated with compost (4 t ha-1) or 50 or 100 kg Zn sulfate ha-1 (on a nursery basis), while the transplanted crop was supplied with only N, P, and K. In the remaining two treatments, no compost or Zn was applied to the rice nursery, but 12.5 or 25 kg Zn sulfate ha-1 was applied along with N, P, and K to the transplanted crop. Rice grain yield, system yield, and gross return above fertilizer cost (GRF) were significantly greater (p < 0.05) with the application of 50 kg Zn sulfate ha-1 than with the application of compost (farmer practices) to rice nurseries. Applying 100 kg Zn sulfate ha⁻1 to the nursery or 12.5-25 kg Zn sulfate ha⁻1 to transplanted rice did not increase yield or GRF. Higher yield, grain Zn content, and GHG emissions occurred in the Rabi season, with the lowest GHG emissions recorded when the nursery received 100 kg Zn sulfate ha⁻1 in both seasons. The results of this study convincingly prove the usefulness of applying Zn along with site specific nutrient management (SSNM) in rice in eastern India to produce high yields and GRFs and reduce GHG emissions.",

Chirality gives NPs unique bioactivity. These chiral ZnS NPs could enter macrophages through the CD44 and clathrin pathways, which enhanced the ability to scavenge ROS, in turn significantly inhibited the NF-κB and NLRP3 signaling pathways, thereby reducing the secretion of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, while upregulating IL-10. In vivo experimental data showed that l-ZnS NPs outperformed 5-aminosalicylic acid, significantly improving body weight, reducing the IBD activity index, and attenuating tissue damage. Concurrently, l-ZnS NPs exhibited a marked prophylactic effect. The benchmark studies verified that l-ZnS NPs increased the abundance of the beneficial Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 by 10.55-fold and decreased harmful Enterobacter by 2914.00-fold, thereby reshaping the intestinal microecological balance. Pharmacokinetic and biosafety assessments confirmed the safety of l-ZnS NPs. Our findings indicate that chiral ZnS NPs hold great potential as nanodrugs for the treatment and prevention of IBD, providing an important foundation for the development of IBD therapeutic strategies."

Oxidative stress induced by inflammation leads to excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and difficulties in bone tissue regeneration. ROS-scavenging agents regulate the periodontal tissue microenvironment, which is of great significance in the treatment of periodontitis. In this study, a zinc-cobalt bimetallic organic framework (Zn/Co-MOF) is constructed to alleviate local tissue inflammation and bone resorption in periodontitis by cascading antioxidant activity. In vitro experimental results show that the Zn/Co-MOF not only provides effective cellular protection against ROS attack in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblast precursor cells (MC3T3-E1), but also promotes osteogenic differentiation. In vivo experiments in rat periodontitis models confirm that Zn/Co-MOFs can reduce local periodontal tissue inflammation, reduce osteoclasts, and promote the recovery of alveolar bone height defects, which is beneficial for the treatment of periodontitis. RNA sequencing results show that the Zn/Co-MOF promotes bone tissue regeneration mainly through activated Wnt pathways, which accelerate osteogenic differentiation. Overall, the Zn/Co-MOF exhibits antioxidant capacity and promotes bone regeneration, making it a promising strategy for the treatment of periodontitis."

However, this association remains to be clarified in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) accompanied by kidney dysfunction. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 149 patients with T2DM (96 men, 53 women), including diabetic kidney disease. Serum concentrations of homocysteine, as well as vitamin B12, folic acid, and zinc, were measured in outpatient T2DM patients. The study subjects were divided into two groups: patients with and without metformin administration (Met [ +], n = 62; Met [ -], n = 87). To explore the effect of kidney function, we also analyzed the data after dividing all the patients according to kidney function (chronic kidney disease [CKD] group, n = 66; non-CKD group, n = 83). RESULTS: The Met ( +) group exhibited significantly higher serum zinc levels and lower serum homocysteine levels than the Met ( -) group. In the non-CKD group, metformin administration was positively associated with serum zinc levels, as demonstrated by multiple linear regression analysis adjusted for confounding factors (β = 0.287, p = 0.021). However, no significant association between metformin administration and serum zinc levels was observed in the CKD group. Moreover, there were no associations between serum homocysteine levels and metformin administration. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between metformin treatment and serum zinc levels differed based on the presence or absence of CKD in patients with T2DM."

      "abstract": "Malnutrition is a problem in many developing economies where cereal crops are the main source of nutrition. Zinc and iron, important micronutrients, play an important role in the physiological and metabolic mechanisms of plants and humans. In this study a field experiment was conducted at the Agronomic Research Area, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad during zaid rabi season in February 2023 to check the impact of different application methods (seed priming, seed coating, soil application, and foliar application) of Zn and Fe on grain zinc and iron content and productivity in mungbean.. Results show that the plant growth parameters are significantly influenced by the concentration and application method of Zn and Fe. The highest plant height (cm), maximum number of branches and pods on plants were observed in foliar application of Zn and Fe combination treatment.. Post-harvest parameters, including biological yield, grain yield and 1000 seed weight were also positively influenced with highest biological yield (4536.27 kg ha-1) and grain yield (1927 kg ha-1) recorded under Zn foliar application. Physiological parameters such as chlorophyll content (SPAD value) and photosystem II Yield (Y(II)) were significantly improved with Zn and Fe treatment, particularly under foliar application. Biochemical analyses revealed that Zn and Fe significantly increase Zn and Fe content in grains with the highest value (36.77 and 63.44 ppm, respectively) observed under Zn foliar treatment. Overall, the foliar application was found most effective, in improving the yield and quality of mungbean. These findings highlight the efficacy of foliar application of Zn and Fe in enhancing mungbean growth, yield, and nutrient content, providing valuable insights for optimizing micronutrient management in mungbean cultivation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to compare the histopathological changes in experimental skin wound healing in mice treated with a topical application of chitosan combined with doxycycline, as well as zinc and selenium nanoparticles. METHODS: Fifty mice with experimental skin wounds were divided into four equal groups: a control group with no therapeutic intervention, a CsD group receiving a transdermal patch containing doxycycline, a CsDZn group receiving a transdermal patch with chitosan-doxycycline-zinc nanoparticles, a CsZnS group receiving a transdermal patch with chitosan-zinc and selenium nanoparticles, and a CsDZnS group receiving a transdermal patch containing chitosan-doxycycline-zinc and selenium nanoparticles. After synthesizing and confirming the efficacy of the transdermal patches, we measured the wound area and histological indices of wound healing on the 7th and 14th days of the study. RESULTS: The results showed that the use of selenium and zinc nanoparticles leads to a decrease in the wound surface in the CsDZnS group compared to the control group and remaining experimental groups. A significant reduction in inflammation and hemorrhage was recorded in the CsDZnS group compared to other groups. On the seventh day of the study, angiogenesis in the CsDZnS group was higher than in the other groups. In addition, on the 14th day of the study, orientation of collagen fibers and re-epithelialization were more observed in the CsDZnS group compared to the other groups. CONCLUSION: The chitosan skin patch containing doxycycline, zinc nanoparticles, and selenium nanoparticles (CsDZnS group) demonstrated the most effective results in skin healing, as evidenced by the highest control of inflammation on days 7 and 14, the greatest re-epithelialization on day 14, and the smallest wound area on both days compared to the other evaluated groups.",

Phthalocyanines (Pcs) are macrocyclic photosensitizers with useful photophysical and photochemical properties in PDT applications. Motivated by these facts, this study has experimentally and theoretically investigated the suitability of 2,6-di-(tert-butyl)-4-methylphenoxy substituted zinc Pc (dt-ZnPc) in the first steps of PDT applications. Photophysical and photochemical characteristics of dt-ZnPc were measured and validated with the literature. Also, the suitability of the dt-ZnPc complex substituted with 2,6-di-(tert-butyl)-4-methylphenoxy groups for PDT applications has been supported by theoretical calculations for the first time. Density Functional Theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations, incorporating both vertical excitation and adiabatic processes, were employed to elucidate the optical and photochemical mechanisms underlying singlet oxygen generation by unsubstituted metal-free and zinc Pcs and dt-ZnPc. Calculated excited state energies agreed well with experimental results, enabling the prediction of photosensitizer activity based on excited state properties and enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) imparted by the metal center."

      "abstract": "Sows were supplemented with high dietary zinc (Zn) at different times in gestation to determine effects on piglet tissue mineral concentrations and gene expression. Ten sSows per treatment were assigned to dietary treatments: 1) Control - sows fed a corn-soybean meal-based diet containing 206 ppm total supplemental zinc supplied by zinc hydroxychloride from mating to farrowing; 2) Breed-to-Farrow - as Control + additional 147 ppm supplemental Zn as ZnSO4 fed from 5 days post-breeding to farrowing; and 3) Day 110-to-Farrow - as Control + additional 4,079 ppm supplemental Zn as ZnSO4 starting on day 110 of gestation until farrowing. Final supplemental Zn concentrations of the Control, Breed-to-Farrow, and Day 110-to-Farrow treatments were 206, 353, and 4,285 ppm, respectively. Serum, colostrum, and milk were collected from each sow. At farrowing, two average (ABW) and two low birth weight (LBW) piglets from each sow were selected for collection of serum and tail samples within 2 days of birth. Liver tissue was collected from 65 piglets that died naturally (n = 35) or were euthanized (n = 30). Blood was collected from a different group of piglets (9 LBW piglets per treatment and 8 ABW Control piglets) for RNA-sequencing to evaluate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathways. Mineral concentration data were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model and RNAseq data were analyzed using the edgeR program. Diet did not affect mineral concentrations of sow serum, colostrum, and milk (P > 0.05). Mineral concentrations of piglet serum were not influenced by maternal Zn treatment or piglet birth weight. Tail Cu for LBW piglets born to sows fed high Zn tended to be lower than Control piglets (P = 0.082) while piglets of LBW had greater concentrations of Fe (P = 0.018) and Cu (P = 0.031) in tails compared to ABW piglets. Piglets that died naturally had greater hepatic Fe concentrations (P < 0.001) than healthy euthanized piglets. Only 2 to 3 DEGs were noted between Control LBW and LBW piglets born to sows fed high Zn. However, 262 DEGs were identified between LBW and ABW piglets. Genes affected by birth weight were associated with pathways of translation and ribosomal activity. In conclusion, timing of feeding high Zn concentrations to gestating sows had minimal influence on concentrations of trace minerals in sows and their offspring, while piglet birth weight may have meaningful effects on mineral metabolism and protein synthesis of neonatal piglets."

A dietary supplement comprising Pelargonium sidoides extract, honey, propolis, and zinc was proposed as an effective adjuvant for the management of respiratory tract infections. The study aimed to determine the efficacy of this dietary supplement in conjunction with standard of care (SoC) compared to SoC alone, in a pediatric population affected by ATR. METHODS: This open randomized study (registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04899401) involved three Romanian sites specialized in pediatric care. The primary endpoints were changes in Tonsillitis Severity Score and the number of patients failing to respond (evaluating the use of ibuprofen or high-dose paracetamol as a rescue medication). One hundred and thirty children, distributed into two groups, were enrolled and treated for six days. RESULTS: The results showed an overall better performance in terms of efficacy of dietary supplement + SoC, compared to SoC alone, with lower total Tonsillitis Severity Score ratings on day 6 (p = 0.002) and lower sub-scores related to erythema and throat pain on day 6. No adverse events were reported. Investigators found compliance to be optimal. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of the dietary supplement + SoC in pediatric patients with ATR was found to be safe and superior to the administration of SoC alone in terms of efficacy. The results confirmed that the tested dietary supplement is an optimum effective adjuvant in the treatment of respiratory tract infections and is suitable for the daily clinical practice of pediatricians."

      "abstract": "This study aims to develop a novel use of baker's yeast in biosorption as a sustainable metal recovery process for cost-effective and practical applications in recovering copper and zinc from waste gravity-thickened sludge generated at livestock wastewater treatment facilities. The supernatant of the acid-extracted product was separated from the residues through centrifugation. To ensure cost efficiency, the supernatant was treated with 2N acetic acid for 24 h, with the addition of hydrogen peroxide, and used for the biosorption experiments. The filtrated supernatant was adjusted to various pH values (4.5, 5.0, and 5.5) to explore the effects of acidity on the subsequent biosorption of extracted zinc and copper by baker's yeast. A diluted molasses solution was added to the filtrate as a carbon source to support yeast growth during the 4 h biosorption experiments. The results revealed that the removal efficiency of zinc from the filtrate by baker's yeast was 97.3%, while the removal efficiency for copper was about 48.8% at pH 5.5 with a reaction time of 4 h. In summary, this combined approach is expected to reduce and recycle heavy metals in livestock sludge. Acetic acid with hydrogen peroxide can extract copper and zinc from the sludge, and baker's yeast can absorb both metals from the filtrate at pH 5.5 in a 4 h reaction time. This technological innovation has the potential to transform waste management practices in the livestock industry, contributing to resource recovery and environmental sustainability."

Periodontitis is a widespread oral disease characterized by inflammation and destruction of the gums and surrounding tissues. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral zinc supplementation as an adjunct to scaling and root planing in the treatment of periodontitis by evaluating its effects on clinical parameters and salivary MMP-8 level. METHODS: 42 patients were enrolled in the study from the periodontology OPD of a tertiary care hospital in India. The subjects were divided into two groups: group 1 and group 2 consisting of 21 patients each of moderate to severe periodontitis. Group 1 was given oral zinc supplementation along with scaling and root planing (SRP) and group 2 was given placebo tablet along with SRP for 1 month. Several periodontal parameters were assessed, including Papillary bleeding Index (BI), Gingival index (GI), Probing pocket depth (PPD) and Clinical attachment level (CAL) at baseline as well as at 1 month post treatment. Around 3 ml of whole unstimulated saliva was collected for MMP-8 estimation by ELISA method at baseline as well as at 1 month. RESULTS: The data was analyzed using SPSS version 26. All clinical parameters and MMP-8 level in saliva were comparable at baseline. 1 month after respective treatment modalities were performed in each group, it was found that all clinical parameters and salivary MMP-8 level showed significant differences with group 1 (zinc + SRP) showing highly significant decrease in GI, PPD and CAL (p < 0.01) and significant decrease in BI and salivary MMP-8 level when compared to group 2 (placebo + SRP) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: When compared with scaling and root planing alone, the administration of oral zinc supplementation along with scaling and root planing showed greater reduction in clinical parameters and salivary MMP-8 levels in patients with moderate to severe periodontitis. Zinc has a positive effect in management of periodontitis and can serve as an easy, cost effective, harmless and beneficial adjunct in treatment of periodontitis."

      "abstract": "Background: Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that deacetylate histone proteins, impacting the transcriptional repression and activation of cancer-associated genes such as P53 and Ras. The overexpression of HDACs in breast cancer (BC) underscores their significance as therapeutic targets for modulating gene expression through epigenetic regulation. Methods: In this study, a novel series of SAHA (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid) analogs were designed using an in silico ligand-based strategy. These analogs were then synthesized and evaluated for their HDAC-inhibitory capacity as well as their antiproliferative capacity on breast cancer cells. These compounds retained an aliphatic LINKER, mimicking the natural substrate acetyl-lysine, while differing from the hydroxamic fragment present in SAHA. Results: The synthesized compounds exhibited HDAC inhibitory activity, suggesting potential for binding to these pharmacological targets. Compounds 5b, 6a, and 6b were identified as promising candidates in the evaluation on breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 at 72 h. Specifically, compound 6b, which contains an N-trifluoroacetyl group as a zinc-binding group (ZBG), demonstrated an IC50 of 76.7 µM in the MDA-MB-231 cell line and 45.7 µM in the MCF-7 cell line. In the non-tumorigenic cell line, the compound exhibited an IC50 of 154.6 µM. Conversely, SAHA exhibited an almost negligible safety margin with regard to its cytotoxic activity when compared to breast cancer cells and healthy cells (MCF-10A). This observation underscores the elevated toxicity exhibited by hydroxamic acid-derived molecules. Conclusions: The bioisosteric modification of ZBG by N-trifluoroacetyl in 6a and 6b demonstrated favorable cytotoxic activity, exhibiting a higher safety margin. This study underscores the challenge of identifying novel ZBGs to replace hydroxamic acid in the development of HDAC inhibitors, with the objective of enhancing their physicochemical and toxicological profile for utilization in BC treatment."

      "abstract": "Nanotechnology has been utilized in diverse domains, encompassing sustainable agriculture. However, the ecotoxicity and environmental safety of nanoparticles need to be evaluated before their large-scale use. This study synthesizes and characterizes magnesium (Mg) and zinc (Zn) co-doped aluminum (Al) oxide (MgZnAl2O4) NPs and elucidates its potential growth-promoting or genotoxic performance on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). XRD, EDX, TEM, SEM, and XPS were used to characterize the MgZnAl2O4 NPs. After characterization, the seedlings were grown in a hydroponic solution containing 0, 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg L-1 NPs for 3 weeks. The germination, growth indices, photosynthetic parameters, and nutrient absorption properties were determined. Confocal microscopy, TEM, and SEM were utilized to follow the path and reveal the structural and morphological effects of NPs. The potential genotoxic effect was evaluated using the RAPD-PCR method. Elemental composition analysis of plant parts confirmed that synthesized MgZnAl2O4 NPs, sized at 21.8 nm, were up-taken by the plant roots, leading to increased Mg, Zn, and Al contents of leaves. In addition, compared with the untreated control, the abundance of Ca, K, B, Fe, Mn, and Cu were increased by the NPs treatment. In addition, physiological indices like germination rate (~ 11%), root and leaf growth (15-29%), chlorophyll, and carotenoids (~ 39%) pigments were significantly raised by the NPs inclusion. It can be concluded that low concentrations (< 200 mg L-1) of MgZnAl2O4 NPs enhance growth parameters effectively and are safe for plant growth. On the other hand, a phytotoxic and genotoxic impact was observed at high concentrations (100-400 mg L-1). However, considerable amounts of NPs were found to be adsorbed on roots, disrupting root morphology and cell membrane integrity, thus nutrient trafficking and transport. Therefore, it is recommended that MgZnAl2O4 NPs can be used in barley breeding programs at low concentrations. Adding micro- or macroelements required by plants to the NP composition is a promising way to compensate for plant nutrition. However, the negative effects of MgZnAl2O4 NPs on the environment and other living beings due to their genotoxic effects at high doses must be carefully considered.",

However, little empirical evidence exists on how co-packaging impacts dispensing practices in low-resource settings. Here, we present findings from a study conducted in Mongu District, Zambia, aimed at evaluating the effect of introducing a co-pack containing ORS and zinc on dispensing behaviour at rural health facilities. Data from dispensing records were collected before and after the introduction of the co-pack, in 2016 and 2017, respectively, from seven government health facilities. We used multilevel logistic regression to account for the fact that the data is clustered by health facility and to address potential intraclass correlations in dispensing practices within the same facility. The results indicate an overall odds ratio of 8.42 (95% CI: 5.47-12.9) for the dispensing of both ORS and zinc together, for 2017 versus 2016, along with a significant reduction in the variability of dispensing practices between facilities (once the co-pack factor was included). Additionally, the data suggest that less well-resourced facilities experienced the greatest benefit from the introduction of the co-pack. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential of co-packaging to foster appropriate diarrhoea-treatment dispensing practices in resource-limited settings. As such, they provide a foundation for further research to validate them on geographical scales beyond the district level."

      "abstract": "Zinc contamination in aquatic environments has become a growing concern due to its potential to bioaccumulate and induce neurotoxic effects in aquatic organisms. As an essential trace element, zinc plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, but excessive exposure can disrupt the gut-brain axis, leading to cognitive and behavioral impairments. Recent studies have suggested that probiotics may offer protective effects against environmental neurotoxins by modulating the gut microbiota and associated neurological functions. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a valuable model organism for studying the biological mechanisms underlying neurotoxicity and potential therapeutic interventions. This study aimed to assess the effects of probiotics on cognitive impairments induced by zinc chloride (ZnCl2) exposure in zebrafish. Specifically, zebrafish were exposed to ZnCl2 at concentrations of 0.5 mg/L and 1.0 mg/L for 96 h, followed by a 7-day post-exposure period to probiotics (Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium animalis lactis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus). ZnCl2 exposure at these concentrations is already known to induce behavioral and neuromotor deficits resembling Alzheimer's disease-like symptoms in zebrafish models, making it a suitable model for evaluating the neuroprotective potential of probiotics. Behavioral assessments including sociability tests along with short- and long-term memory evaluations were conducted using EthoVision XT 16 software. Memory tests demonstrated that ZnCl2 exposure impaired cognitive functions, while probiotic treatment did not significantly ameliorate these deficits. In the social behavior test, ZnCl2 at 0.5 mg/L resulted in a marked decrease in sociability, whereas exposure to 1.0 mg/L did not induce significant changes. However, post-exposure probiotic administration following ZnCl2 intoxication at 1.0 mg/L exhibited an anxiolytic effect on zebrafish. These findings suggest that probiotics may exhibit partial neurobehavioral benefits following zinc chloride-induced toxicity, particularly in mitigating anxiety-like behaviors rather than cognitive deficits. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which probiotics interact with the gut-brain axis in the context of heavy metal neurotoxicity."

      "abstract": "Vulvovaginal symptoms affect up to 39% of women. These symptoms have a significant impact on quality of life and are often linked to imbalances in the vaginal microbiota. This study evaluates the therapeutic efficacy of a zinc-containing hydroxyethyl cellulose-based hydrogel in 37 women with different vulvovaginal symptoms (itching, burning, irritation, pain, dryness, discharge, and odor). Over 12 weeks, participants applied the gel intravaginally with both assessments conducted at baseline and follow-ups. Results revealed substantial improvements in symptoms, including reductions in vaginal discharge, itching, and burning, as measured by the Vulvovaginal Symptom Questionnaire (VSQ-21), with scores decreasing from 10.78 ± 3.66 at baseline to 3.17 ± 4.16 at week 12 (p < 0.01). Vaginal Health Index (VHI) scores improved significantly, from 20.78 ± 1.74 at baseline to 23.64 ± 2.59 (p < 0.01). Cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) zinc levels decreased from 110 ± 102 µg/L at baseline to 62 ± 48 µg/L at week 4 (p < 0.01), increased to 80 ± 55 µg/L at week 8 (p = 0.04), and reached 99 ± 92 µg/L by week 12 (NS). A correlation analysis showed an inverse relationship between baseline CVL zinc levels and VSQ-21 scores (r = -0.3586, p = 0.034), while no significant correlation was observed with VHI scores (r = -0.0187, p = 0.9545). Vaginal pH levels decreased significantly, dropping from 4.03 ± 0.42 to 3.71 ± 0.48 (p < 0.01). These findings support the gel's role as an effective, nonhormonal, drug-free, and local adjunct treatment for a variety of vulvovaginal symptoms."

      "abstract": "In the 21st century, sustainable agriculture is expected to become a major contributor to food security and improved nutrition. Amine-epoxide-based materials have great potential for use in agriculture due to their tunable physicochemical features, which are dependent on the concentration and composition of the monomers. In this work, catalyst-free green synthesis, using only water as a solvent, was performed to obtain a nanocarrier (TGel) capable of transporting nutrients after seed priming. The synthesis was based on the opening of the epoxy ring by nucleophile attack, using an amine-terminated polyether. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques showed the spherical morphology of the particles, which ranged in size from 80 nm (unloaded TGel) to 360 nm (zinc-loaded TGel), respectively. Theoretical bonding analysis revealed that Zn cation species from the ZnSO4 source interact with the polymer via σ-bonds, whereas EDTA forms hydrogen bonds with the polymer, thereby enhancing noncovalent interactions. Micro X-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF) and energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (EDXRF) provided details of the distributions of Zn in the seed compartments and shoots of cucumber plants after seed priming and plant growth, respectively. The use of the Zn-loaded TGels did not affect the physiology of the cucumber plants, as indicated by the photosynthetic efficacy, chlorophyll, and anthocyanin indices."

It not only uncovers novel potential biomarkers but also provides robust molecular recognition tools for a wide spectrum of applications. In this work, we generate a high affinity aptamer, HL15, through Cell-SELEX. A refined sequence HL15a demonstrated a strong binding affinity to target cells, with a minimal dissociation constant (Kd) of just 1.90 ± 0.49 nM. Subsequent truncation and mutation assays revealed that the core sequence of HL15a forms an antiparallel G-quadruplex structure. Furthermore, the target proteins of aptamer HL15a were identified and confirmed to be ZIP10 and ZIP6, both members of the zinc transporter ZIP family with high homology. Using HL15a as a molecular probe, we detected a range of universal binding affinities to the majority of tumor cells in the 48 cell lines evaluated. Furthermore, HL15a was effectively applied to distinguish high malignancy cancer tissues from both normal and low malignancy tissues in the pathological sections of breast and prostate cancers. Given that ZIP10 and ZIP6 play crucial roles in regulating zinc homeostasis and are implicated in numerous diseases, the aptamer HL15a offers a powerful tool for the study and potential therapeutic intervention of these two proteins.",

      "abstract": "Aqueous batteries, such as aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIB), have garnered significant attention because of their advantages in intrinsic safety, low cost, and eco-friendliness. However, aqueous electrolytes tend to freeze at low temperatures, which limits their potential industrial applications. Thus, one of the core challenges in aqueous electrolyte design is optimizing the formula to prevent freezing while maintaining good ion conductivity. However, the experimental trial-and-error approach is inefficient for this purpose, and existing simulation tools are either inaccurate or too expensive for high-throughput phase transition predictions. In this work, we employ a small amount of experimental data and differentiable simulation techniques to develop a multimodal optimization workflow. With minimal human intervention, this workflow significantly enhances the prediction power of classical force fields for electrical conductivity. Most importantly, the simulated electrical conductivity can serve as an effective predictor of electrolyte freezing at low temperatures. Generally, the workflow developed in this work introduces a new paradigm for electrolyte design. This paradigm leverages both easily measurable experimental data and fast simulation techniques to predict properties that are challenging to access by using either approach alone."

The highest L-Glutaminase production of 9.57 U/mL was achieved on the 4th day of fermentation when L-Glutamine was used as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. Enhanced recycling stability was observed after 6 cycles using L-Glutaminase immobilized in 3% agar and agarose matrices. Free and immobilized L- Glutaminase showed Km of 13.89 ± 0.8 and 7.13 ± 0.3 mM and Vmax of 18.40 ± 1.5 and 24.21 ± 1.7 U/mg respectively. L- Glutaminase capped silver (AgNP) and zinc oxide (ZnONP) nanoparticles were synthesized and structurally characterized using UV visible spectroscopy, FTIR, SEM-EDS, XRD and AFM. L- Glutaminase capped AgNP and ZnONP exhibited good thermal stability with five and three stages weight loss pattern respectively based on TGA. L-Glutaminase capped AgNP exhibited highest inhibitory activity against B. subtilis (45 ± 0.5 mm) and E. coli (33 ± 0.8 mm) whereas, L-Glutaminase capped ZnONP demonstrated highest inhibition against E. coli (30 ± 0.3 mm) and B. cereus (25 ± 0.5 mm). Increased nanoparticles concentration exhibited increased inhibitory potential as compared to wild L-Glutaminase and lowest MIC of 0.09 µg/mL was exhibited against B. cereus. L-Glutaminase capped nanoparticles demonstrated significant antioxidant properties through in-vitro ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging assays in a dosage-dependent manner. L-Glutaminase and capped AgNP and ZnONP, demonstrated pronounced cell cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cancerous cell line with 57.17 µg/mL, 8.13 µg/mL and 28.31 µg/mL IC50 values respectively, suggesting promising properties as anticancer agents in enzyme-based therapy. The results reveal promising biological activities with potential applications in healthcare sector."

METHODS: ZnQDs were synthesized and characterized by transmission electron microscope and fluorescence observation. Minimal inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of ZnQDs against Streptococcus mutans were evaluated. ZnQDs (20% by weight) were incorporated into Transbond XT adhesive paste to form the multifunctional orthodontic adhesive (quantum dots adhesive 20 [QDA20]). Long-term antibiofilm capability and fluorescence properties were evaluated after saliva storage aging. A biofilm demineralization model was constructed, and the enamel demineralization degree was evaluated by color analysis, Raman analysis and microcomputed tomography. Bracket bonding and debonding procedures were performed on a head simulator, and the effectiveness of adhesive removal was assessed. Subcutaneous tissue, blood, and organ compatibility assays were performed on a rat subcutaneous tissue implant model. RESULTS: ZnQDs had a diameter of approximately 5 nm, and the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration against S mutans were 0.32 and 1.25 mg/mL. ZnQDs showed long-lasting antibiofilm and fluorescent properties and could reduce the color change and mineral loss of enamel during the biofilm demineralization process. On the head simulator, QDA20 could help the operator remove adhesive more thoroughly without damaging enamel. Histologic analysis of subcutaneous tissue and organs, and blood analysis proved that QDA20 was well-biocompatible. CONCLUSIONS: ZnQDs showed excellent antibiofilm and fluorescent properties and thus could be a multifunctional adhesive to overcome the 2 major challenges of enamel demineralization and difficulty in recognizing adhesives during fixed orthodontic treatment."

Biochemical analyses on the haemolymph revealed a significant increase in aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamic transpeptidase activities, and glucose and cholesterol levels in crayfish exposed to MPs and ZnO-NPs. In contrast, butyrylcholinesterase activity was significantly decreased in all treatments compared to the control. Lactate dehydrogenase activity increased significantly in crayfish exposed to ZnO-NPs, alone or combined with MPs. Furthermore, thiol groups, total antioxidant levels, and glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase were significantly decreased, while malondialdehyde levels were increased. The integrated biomarker response (IBR) and radar plots highlighted a cumulative oxidative stress response, suggesting potential synergistic or additive interactions between MPs and ZnO-NPs."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the main component of renal cell carcinoma, and advanced ccRCC often predicts a poor prognosis. In recent years, research has revealed the critical role of Cys2His2 zinc finger genes (CHZFs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the development of cancer. Currently, little is known about the prognostic value of the lncRNAs linked to Cys2His2 (C2H2) zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) in ccRCC. The aim of this study was to construct a prognostic model for C2H2-associated lncRNAs to assist in the selection of clinical therapy. METHODS: RNA-sequencing data, and related clinical and prognostic information were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify Cys2His2 zinc finger-associated long non-coding RNAs (CHZFLs) and build prediction signatures. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to validate the risk model. The prognosis of the groups was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The independent prognostic significance of these signatures was evaluated by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The relationship between the CHZFL signature and ccRCC tumor immunity was confirmed by a differential analysis of immune function and immunological checkpoints. RESULTS: A signature composed of five lncRNAs (AL117336.2, AC026401.3, AC124854.1, DBH-AS1, and LINC02100) was constructed. The results revealed a strong correlation between the CHZFLs signature and the prognosis of ccRCC patients. Prognostic characteristics of CHZFLs are independent prognostic factors in ccRCC patients. The diagnostic efficacy of the predictive signature was higher than that of individual clinicopathologic variables, and it had a ROC area under the curve (AUC) of 0.775. The results of the clinical subgroup analysis showed that the high-risk group had shorter overall survival (OS) than the low-risk group. Common chemotherapy medications, including vinorelbine, cytarabine, epirubicin, and gemcitabine, caused increased sensitivity in the high-risk group. Additionally, the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) revealed that the immunological state of the ccRCC patients was substantially linked with the predictive parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The five CHZFL signature can help predict the prognosis of ccRCC patients, and assist in selecting immunotherapy and chemotherapy regimens in clinical practice."

The aim of this study was to determine whether activity concentrations and ADs calculated from a high-speed whole-body 360° cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) SPECT camera are comparable to those provided by conventional SPECT. Methods: Fifteen patients referred for [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE treatment were enrolled and underwent, at 24, 96, and 168 h after [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE injection, 32 min of thoracoabdominopelvic conventional SPECT recording and 18 min of whole-body CZT SPECT recording. The order of device procedure (conventional or CZT SPECT) was randomly selected to avoid bias. The kidneys, bone marrow, liver, and spleen were automatically segmented by an artificial intelligence-based tool on CT images, whereas the largest tumor was segmented manually on CT or MR images. Time-integrated activity curves were computed using activity concentrations from the kidneys, bone marrow, liver, spleen, and tumor and convolved by the voxel S-value kernel to calculate AD values. The partial-volume effect was corrected by fitting the recovery coefficients of 1- to 113-mL spheres. Activity concentrations (in Bq/mL) and ADs (in Gy/GBq) were expressed as median (minimum to maximum) and compared between the 2 cameras with Wilcoxon tests. Results: Activity concentrations and ADs were not significantly different between conventional and CZT SPECT, respectively, for the kidneys (337.3 [203.3-622.4] vs. 342.7 [218.2-547.8] kBq/mL at 24 h and 0.45 [0.26-0.79] vs. 0.47 [0.25-0.79] Gy/GBq), spleen (340.3 [171.8-703.1] vs. 277.7 [215.6-640.8] kBq/mL at 24 h and 0.48 [0.31-1.41] vs. 0.50 [0.35-1.15] Gy/GBq), bone marrow (32.7 [13.9-662.9] vs. 41.1 [12.4-509.6] kBq/mL at 24 h and 0.09 [0.04-1.96] vs. 0.13 [0.06-0.87] Gy/GBq), and largest tumor (826.8 [376.4-4,459.0] vs. 1,116.7 [447.0-6,043.3] kBq/mL at 24 h and 1.8 [0.9-5.7] vs. 2.0 [1.0-7.3] Gy/GBq). However, significant, albeit small, differences were observed for the liver (126.2 [42.7-335.9] vs. 113.5 [35.1-293.4] kBq/mL at 24 h and 0.23 [0.07-0.72] vs. 0.21 [0.05-0.64] Gy/GBq, both P < 0.01). Conclusion: Activity concentrations and absorbed doses calculated from the 360° CZT SPECT/CT system after [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE injection are globally comparable to those obtained from a conventional SPECT/CT system. However, CZT SPECT/CT is more appropriate for clinical routine, with shorter recording times and actual whole-body coverage."

Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) arise as a complication of chronic venous insufficiency and represent the most prevalent type of slow-healing wound in the lower extremities. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case report, we present the successful treatment of a 75-year-old woman with a chronic venous ulcer caused by chronic deep venous insufficiency. The patient had been struggling with an unresponsive venous leg ulcer for 7 years with no improvement from previous treatments. A three-layer Unna boot treatment, including (ZnO NPs) and a two-component compression system was applied, and significant ulcer reduction was observed. DISCUSSION: ZnO NPs impregnated bandages, like those found in an Unna boot, offer compression by wrapping gauze dressing impregnated with ZnO NPs around the patient's leg forming a semi-solid mold around the extremity. A more efficient treatment approach could lead to fewer clinic visits, thereby reducing healthcare expenses by enhancing the method of managing venous ulcers through a combination of compression and simple, cost-effective surface dressing materials. It's worth noting that ZnO NPs have demonstrated significant benefits for wound healing. CONCLUSION: Utilizing ZnO NPs alongside compression therapy has proven highly effective, accelerating healing and offering a cost-effective solution. Further research is needed to study the safety of ZnO NPs."

These prepared films that loaded with the different concentrations of ZnFe₂O₄ were nominated as 1ZnFe₂O₄@HEC/Cs, 2ZnFe₂O₄@HEC/Cs, and 3ZnFe₂O₄@HEC/Cs films and compared with the films (HEC/Cs) that prepared without ZnFe₂O₄ loading. The prepared films (1ZnFe₂O₄@HEC/Cs, 2ZnFe₂O₄@HEC/Cs, and 3ZnFe₂O₄@HEC/Cs) exhibited rough morphological surface. The influence of various parameters such as pH, dye concentration, adsorbent dose, and contact time were systematically explored to optimize the adsorption conditions. Compared to pure HEC/Cs (199 mg/g), the adsorption power of MO dye sequestration in the presence of 3ZnFe₂O₄@HEC/Cs was 288 mg/g. The experimental results are described by chemical kinetics with a pseudo-second order. The Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption models were employed to analyze the experimental results indicating multilayer adsorption of MO dye. The results reveal that the ZnFe₂O₄@HEC/Cs composite demonstrates a rapid adsorption rate and high dye removal efficiency, with the ability to maintain its performance even in the presence of common contaminants. Moreover, the composite can be easily regenerated, offering a sustainable solution for dye removal in wastewater treatment. This study provides valuable insights into designing advanced, environmentally friendly adsorbents to remove dyes from polluted water. The exceptional performance and reusability of ZnFe₂O₄@HEC/Cs films highlight their potential for large-scale wastewater treatment applications."

      "abstract": "Minerals play an essential role in aquatic animals to maintain their normal physiological and metabolic functions. This feeding trial assessed the impact of various zinc sources on L. rohita performance. Dietary treatments included a Control group with zinc sulfate (226.25 mg/kg), and treatment groups with zinc citrate (150.15 mg/kg), zinc acetate (230.56 mg/kg), zinc monomethionine (244.75 mg/kg), and zinc gluconate (395.94 mg/kg). In 15 aquaria, 300 fish (15.84 ± 0.07g) were randomly distributed in triplicate groups. Results revealed significantly (P < 0.05) higher final body weight (FBW), feed conversion ratio (FCR), body weight gain (BWG), and sediment growth rate (SGR) for zinc gluconate fed fish compared to the other sources. Zinc gluconate fed L. rohita also exhibited the lowest feed intake, while initial body weight (IBW) and survival rate (SR %) did not significantly differ. Proximate fish analysis showed non-significant (P > 0.05) differences among treatments. Tissue zinc analysis demonstrated significantly (P < 0.05) higher zinc content in L. rohita receiving zinc gluconate. Antioxidant enzyme activity indicated lower (2.12 ± 0.01) thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in the zinc gluconate treatment, with elevated levels of key biomarker enzymes, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Stress and immune response indicators revealed significantly lower hematocrit (HCT), cortisol (CRT), and glucose (GLU) levels in zinc gluconate fed fish, while CRT was higher (36.62 ± 0.65 mg/ml). Blood serum parameters, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), remained lower (29.65 ± 0.85 U/ml, 84.76 ± 2.45 U/ml, and 212.87 ± 6.14 U/ml), in fish fed zinc gluconate respectively. In conclusion, different organic zinc sources, particularly zinc gluconate, improved L. rohita growth, tissue zinc concentration, antioxidant enzyme activity, blood serum parameters, and stress and immune response to varying extents.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High-fat diets (HFDs) can lead to excessive accumulation of lipids in the liver, leading to liver injury. Dietary zinc (Zn) has been shown to reduce HFD-induced lipid accumulation and improve lipid profiles in mammals, yet it remains unclear whether waterborne Zn maintains its lipid-lowering effects in osteichthyes. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to elucidate the regulatory role of Zn in HFD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation in yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) and its potential mechanisms. METHODS: Yellow catfish were fed a control diet (11.21% lipid concentration), HFD (16.10% lipid concentration), or HFD combined with waterborne Zn exposure (0.2 mg/L) for 8 wk. Various biochemical, genetic, histologic, and molecular techniques were conducted to evaluate hepatic lipid deposition and lipid metabolism and determine protein interactions between silent information regulator (SIRT) 1 and farnesoid X receptor (FXR), as well as protein-gene interactions between FXR and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). RESULTS: HFD feeding significantly increased liver fat content and induced hepatic damage in yellow catfish, but concurrent exposure to waterborne Zn alleviated these detrimental effects. Zn treatment increased mRNA and protein concentrations of SIRT1 (mean ± SEM; 97.19% ± 11.67% and 83.25% ± 28.60%, respectively) and FXR (163.90% ± 24.60% and 24.90% ± 11.12%, respectively) in yellow catfish liver (P < 0.05). Zn-activated FXR directly interacted with the promoter of ATGL, stimulating the expression of atgl (54.40% ± 16.33%; P < 0.05) and facilitating the hydrolysis of triglycerides and lipid droplets. Furthermore, Zn reduced the acetylation concentration of FXR by SIRT1 deacetylation of FXR protein K167. CONCLUSIONS: The findings reveal that Zn protect against HFD-induced liver injury in yellow catfish by promoting the deacetylation of FXR protein K167 by SIRT1 and activating FXR, thereby promoting the transcriptional activation of ATGL to increase lipolysis."

This study aimed to investigate the impacts of zinc caproate (ZnCA, C12H22O4Zn) on the intestinal health, growth performance, inflammatory status, and Zn homeostasis of weaned piglets challenged with ETEC K88. In total, 48 weaned piglets (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire, 7.78 ± 0.19 kg, 28 d) were selected for a 21-d experiment. Each experimental treatment consisted of 6 replicate pens with 2 piglets each. The treatment conditions were as follows: i) a basal diet (CON), ii) a basal diet + ETEC K88 (NC), iii) a basal diet + 2,500 mg/kg of Zn (provided as zinc oxide, ZnO) + ETEC K88 (PC), and iv) a basal diet + 1,600 mg/kg of Zn (provided as ZnCA) + ETEC K88 (ZnCA). RESULTS: The addition of 1,600 mg/kg ZnCA to the diet of post-weaning piglets effectively enhanced growth performance and nutrient digestibility and reduced the incidence of diarrhea and inflammatory reactions caused by ETEC K88 infection. These therapeutic effects were comparable to those of pharmacological doses of ZnO. In terms of improving intestinal health and Zn homeostasis in post-weaning piglets challenged with ETEC K88, the effectiveness of 1,600 mg/kg ZnCA surpassed that of pharmacological doses of ZnO. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, under the experimental conditions of this study, ZnCA exhibited the potential to reduce the pharmacological dosage of ZnO while improving intestinal health and Zn homeostasis in weaned piglets."

Hibiscus syriacus L., valued for its ornamental, edible, and medicinal properties, is widely cultivated in Cd-contaminated areas of southern China.This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of nano-zinc oxide (nZnO) in alleviating Cd toxicity in H. syriacus, examining plant phenotypes, physiological and biochemical responses, root ultrastructure, and the accumulation and distribution of Cd and Zn within the soil-H. syriacus system. Pot experiments included Cd treatment (100 mg/kg) and combined soil or foliar applications of nZnO (50 and 100 mg/L), with plants harvested after 45 days. Compared to Cd treatment alone, the combined application of nZnO significantly increased biomass in roots, stems, and leaves, improved photosynthetic performance, osmotic regulation, and antioxidant levels, and mitigated root cell damage; Cd concentrated mainly in roots, and nZnO reduced root Cd levels by 0.24 %-9.06 %. SEM-EDS observations revealed that Cd predominantly accumulated in the root epidermis and cortex, with Cd stress leading to increased levels and localized aggregation of Cd in the xylem. By contrast, nZnO treatment alleviated this disruption. Leaf application of 50 mg/L nZnO showed the best results. These findings highlight nZnO as a promising nano fertilizer for alleviating Cd stress in plants."

RECENT FINDINGS: The process of gene transcription affects the important physiological functions of cells, so the normal expression of transcription factors is an important prerequisite for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Changes in the level of zinc finger proteins, the most prevalent transcription factor, may play an important trigger for the development of colorectal cancer. Different zinc finger proteins play different roles in terms of promoting or inhibiting cancer development. CONCLUSION: This paper briefly reviews the classification, functional characteristics, and expression changes of zinc finger proteins in colorectal cancer, it focuses on how they regulate gene transcription, influence on common signaling pathways, and their potential for translational studies and clinical applications. The objective is to stimulate new ideas for their study of colorectal cancer while also providing foundational information to guide drug development and treatment strategies for colorectal cancer patients in clinical settings.",

The resulting product was characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmittance electron microscopies, as well as UV-visible and photoluminescence spectroscopies. The diffuse reflectance absorption spectra showed the absorption onsets due to copper oxide (885 nm) and zinc oxide (310 and 580 nm) in the product. The adsorption of methylene blue was fitted well by the Langmuir model with the maximum adsorption capacity of 454 mg⋅g-1. The thermodynamic studies revealed that the process is exothermic and spontaneous. The photocatalytic activity of the hybrid was assessed by the degradation of methylene blue in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation. The most active species in the photocatalytic process was hydroxyl radicals. The regenerated copper oxide/zinc oxide-montmorillonite was reused up to 5 cycles, the photodegradation efficiency dropped only 5% (from 94% to 89%), supporting the good stability of the photocatalyst. The result was in agreement with the advantages of the nanocomposite heterostructure and the unique nature of montmorillonite."

Nutritional deficiencies, including poor nutritional status reflected by a high CONUT score and low serum zinc have been implicated in the severity and wound healing failure of DFU. However, the association between these factors and DFU remains unclear.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was performed in 319 patients categorized into three groups: healthy controls (HC, n = 213), patients with diabetes without foot ulcer (DM, n = 67), and patients with diabetes with foot ulcer (DFU, n = 39). Demographic, clinical, nutritional, and biochemical data were collected, including age, sex, body mass index, the presence of chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI), the presence of maintenance dialysis, CONUT score, hemoglobin A1c, hemoglobin (Hb), total protein (TP), and zinc levels. The severity of DFU was assessed using the PEDIS score, while wound healing failure was defined based on specific clinical criteria. Statistical analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with DFU severity and wound healing failure.ResultsDFU cases had significantly lower Hb, TP, and zinc levels and higher CONUT score compared to the HC and DM cases. Within the DFU group, high PEDIS score (>8) was associated with significantly higher CONUT score, lower TP levels, and the presence of CLTI. Patients with wound healing failure had significantly lower zinc and Hb levels and a higher prevalence of CLTI. Multivariable logistic regression identified CONUT score and the prevalence of CLTI as independent factors associated with DFU severity, while serum zinc levels and the prevalence of CLTI were independently associated with wound healing failure.ConclusionsThis study highlighted the critical role of poor nutritional status, as indicated by high CONUT score, and zinc deficiency in the severity and poor healing outcomes of DFU. These findings underscore the critical role of nutritional management in comprehensive treatment of DFU."

      "abstract": "Compared to conventional adsorbents, zinc-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) such as zeolite imidazolium skeleton-8 (ZIF-8) exhibit enhanced thermal, chemical, and structural stability. Nonetheless, their powdered form results in limited dispersibility in aqueous solutions and a tendency to aggregate, which significantly restricts their utility in adsorption applications. This study reports a green composite aerogel through the in situ mineralization of ZIF-8 onto bacterial cellulose (BC) for the effective removal of toxic metal ions (Cu2+) and Congo red (CR) from wastewater. The ZIF@BC composite aerogel was characterized using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and specific surface area analysis. The findings indicated that the ZIF-8 produced were evenly distributed across the BC nanonetwork, facilitating effective adsorption of CR and Cu2+. The maximum adsorption capacities of the ZIF@BC aerogels were determined to be 397.55 mg/g for CR and 424.80 mg/g for Cu2+, as per the Langmuir isotherm. Furthermore, the ZIF-8@BC aerogels demonstrated excellent selectivity and reusability, particularly for CR adsorption. The proposed mechanism for the interaction between the composite aerogel and CR and Cu2+ involves electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, π-π bonding, coordination bonding, ion exchange, microchemical precipitation, and pore diffusion. This research offers significant promise for the utilization of MOF powders and highlights substantial industrial potential.",

After zinc deficiency treatment, the content of chlorophyll and Pro, the activity of catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), root-to-shoot ratio, root length and root fresh weight of overexpressed plants were significantly increased, while the MDA content was significantly decreased. The ratio of zinc content between the above-ground part and the root of the overexpressed plants was significantly higher than that of the non-transgenic plants, and the transport efficiency from the root to the above-ground part was significantly increased in the overexpressed plants, whereas it was just the opposite in the interference expressing plants.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The nutritional status of communities susceptible to Buruli ulcer (BU, a skin NTD caused by infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans) remains almost completely obscure. We have assessed the diets of BU patients vs. controls from the same BU-endemic communities, and compared their circulating biomarkers of nutrients and inflammation. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated two cohorts of BU patients and controls. The first were administered food frequency and multi-pass 24-hour recall questionnaires to determine patterns of foods consumed, nutrient intake and nutrient adequacy. The second used archived serum samples collected as baseline to measure the circulating concentration of zinc, vitamin C, CRP, IL-1β, IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-6. Stunted growth was more prevalent than expected (31%), while 18% of participants were underweight and most had inadequate intake of all micronutrients except for carbohydrate. BU patients had a lower intake of, selenium, vitamin B12 and zinc, and for selenium and vitamin B12 a higher proportion had dietary insufficiency (40% vs. 15% and 80% vs. 55%, respectively). In line with this, BU patients had significantly lower levels of zinc in their serum, and more had levels below the normal range (72% vs. 43%). Despite many participants having a good intake of vitamin C, serum levels were low, and lower amongst the BU patients. As expected, there was little evidence of systemic inflammation (CRP <0.6 mg/L). Elevated IL-6 levels were present in several participants suggesting that environmental enteric dysfunction may be prevalent in these communities, however this was similar in cases vs. controls. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Diet and nutritional status may be a contributing factor to BU pathogenesis. Protein and the micronutrients zinc, selenium, vitamin B12 and vitamin C may be of particular importance. Nutritional interventions may have potential for both prophylaxis and treatment of BU, which may be a cost-effective approach to achieving the NTD Roadmap goals.",

      "abstract": "Most antimicrobials used in pig production are prescribed to treat post-weaning diarrhea (PWD), which constitutes a major health issue in pig production. With the spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens, finding solutions to diminish the severity of PWD without antibiotics has become increasingly critical. Potentiated forms of zinc oxide (ZnO) and plant-based bioactive compounds like tannins have been shown to alleviate the severity of diarrhea, thus reducing the need for antibiotic treatment. The aim of this project was to test whether a potentiated form of ZnO (pZnO), alone (study 1) or in combination with tannin-rich extract (study 2), can be used in starter diets for weaned piglets infected by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) to reduce PWD severity. At 26 ± 1.6 days of age (average body weight 7.8 ± 1.02 kg), 160 piglets (study 1, n = 72; study 2, n = 88) were randomly and equally assigned to four dietary treatments (study 1 = 18; study 2 = 22 pigs/group) and orally infected 4 days after weaning with a solution containing 1010 ETEC F4. Study 1 compared the effect of 150 mg Zn/kg pZnO (pZnO-150) and 300 mg Zn/kg pZnO (pZnO-300) to a negative control (C) and a positive control, 3,000 mg Zn/kg ZnO (C-3000). In study 2, a combination of 7.5 g/kg tannin extract (quebracho and chestnut) and 150 mg Zn/kg pZnO (TAN+pZnO-150) was compared to pZnO-150 and 7.5 g/kg tannin-rich extract (TAN) alone and to a negative control (C). The fecal score, bodyweight, daily food intake per pen, fecal F4 ETEC and Zn levels were analyzed. The small intestine content was sampled 9 days after infection to analyze the number of antimicrobial resistance genes. Regardless of the inclusion level, TAN+pZnO-150, TAN and pZnO led to a reduction in antibiotic treatment (p < 0.05), but only TAN and TAN+pZnO-150 reduced the fecal score (p < 0.05). C-3000 improved the average daily gain (p < 0.05). Tannin-rich extract and potentiated zinc oxide (pZnO) in starter diets effectively reduce the need for antibiotics in ETEC-challenged piglets. Traditional high-dose ZnO improved growth rates, but lower-dose alternatives with tannins provided health benefits without high zinc levels. These findings highlight sustainable dietary strategies to manage post-weaning diarrhea, supporting reduced antibiotic use in pig production."

      "abstract": "Ischemeia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a severe complication after restoring blood perfusion in acute myocardial infarction treatment, in which vascular endothelial cell dysfunction is considered as the key event to exacerbate myocardial injury. We have previously verified the protective function of ZNF580 in endothelial cells, however, the impact of ZNF580 on I/R injury and its underlying mechanisms have not been explored in depth. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the regulatory role of ZNF580 on myocardial I/R injury and confirm that ZNF580 is a potential therapeutic candidate for I/R injury treatment. The potential mechanism of ZNF580 in I/R injury was determined via bioinformatics. A model of I/R injury in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was subsequently established to confirm whether ZNF580 protects against I/R injury and whether this protective effect is exerted through the regulation of autophagic flow. Our study identified 459 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in I/R injury. ZNF580 increased cell viability and gradually restored cell morphology, the cytoplasm was full, the intracellular structure was clear, and the cell space was significantly reduced in HUVECs exposed to I/R injury. Both Western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were used to detect the levels of different apoptosis-related proteins, it is shown that the ZNF580 significantly increased lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) and light chain 3 (LC3) expressions, and markedly decreased protein 62 (P62) expression. Moreover, ZNF580 decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the supernatant and the rate of apoptosis. ZNF580 promoted autophagosome and lysosome fusion and increased autophagic flux, thereby protecting HUVECs from I/R injury. Its protective effect is possibly related to the activation of the adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to green synthesize and characterize the zinc nanoparticles (ZNP) and evaluate its potency to control Toxoplasma gondii infection in mice by stimulating the immune system, antioxidant activity, and anti-inflammatory effects. METHODS: By in vivo, T. gondii infected mice were orally treated by ZNP (5-20 mg/kg) for 14 d. The number and size of tissue cysts, oxidant-antioxidant enzymes, the expression of inflammatory cytokines, apoptotic, and pathogenicity-related factors were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: ZNP ranged in size from 10 to 70 nm with an average size of 45.7 ± 19.4 nm. ZNP treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the number and size of tissue cysts (P < 0.05). The oral administration of infected mice with ZNP caused a considerable decrease in malondialdehyde levels and a marked increase (P < 0.001) in the activity of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase. ZNP administration triggered a significant reduction in the expression levels of the genes of interleukin-1β, tumour necrosis factor-α, nuclear factor kappa B, bradyzoite antigen-1, and B-cell lymphoma-2. Conversely, there was an increase in the expression levels of the genes of IL-10, Serpin A3k, caspase-3, and Bcl-2-associated X protein (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the recent investigation illustrated that ZNP demonstrates promising in vivo effects against T. gondii infection in mice. These effects are ascribed to its antioxidant properties, anti-inflammatory characteristics through the inhibition the specific inflammatory cytokines, and its ability to inhibit pathogenicity in mice without any observable signs of toxicity."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is an increasingly severe public health issue globally. Micronutrients are essential for maintaining normal physiological functions and metabolic balance; however, their relationship with OA is not fully understood. METHODS: This study aimed to evaluate the potential causal relationships between 15 key micronutrients and the risk of OA using both two-sample and multivariate Mendelian randomization approaches. We gathered data from a large prospective cohort of genome-wide association studies on these micronutrients and OA. Comprehensive Mendelian randomization analyses were conducted using inverse variance weighting, MR Egger, weighted median, weighted models, and simple models. Through multivariate analyses, factors such as BMI and strenuous exercise were controlled to assess the independent associations between zinc and OA risk. RESULTS: In the two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis, zinc was positively associated with OA risk (OR = 1.045, 95% CI: 1.009 to 1.082, P = 0.015). This association remained significant even after controlling for other confounding factors in multivariate analyses, indicating an independent effect of zinc. Other micronutrients, such as calcium, iron, and vitamin D, did not show significant associations with OA risk in this study. CONCLUSION: This study provides new evidence of a positive association between the micronutrient zinc and the risk of OA, emphasizing the importance of considering micronutrients in osteoarthritis prevention and treatment strategies. Future research should further validate these findings and explore the specific biological mechanisms by which zinc influences the risk of osteoarthritis.",

      "abstract": "Liver regenerative therapy is critical for severe liver damage, including acute liver failure, fibrosis, post-cancer resection recovery, and autoimmune liver diseases, where restoration of liver tissues is essential. Stem cell-based therapies hold significant promise in liver regeneration by modulating immune responses to create a favorable healing microenvironment. However, their clinical efficacy has been limited by challenges such as poor cell engraftment and survival within the hostile injury site. To address these limitations, we developed a zinc oxide-derived nanoparticle (PZnONP) that enhances stem cell proliferation and activation by releasing bioactive Zn2+ and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Functionalized PZnONP exhibits pH-responsive behavior and improved dispersibility, enabling a lysosome-specific and sustained release of Zn2+ and ROS. Stem cells labeled with PZnONP (ZnBA) demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties, with paracrine effects influencing macrophages and damaged hepatocytes. In murine models of acute and fibrotic liver injury, it effectively migrated to the liver through stem cell homing effects and promoted anti-inflammatory responses by modulating Treg and Th17 cell polarization, as well as M2 and M1 macrophage balance, while reducing collagen synthesis. This study underscores the potential of integrating stem cell-based therapy with nanomedicine to improve regenerative outcomes in liver disease treatment.",

This study inspected the in vivo anticoccidial efficacy of biosynthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles (Bio-ZnNPs) from Coriandrum sativum leaves in mice infected with Eimeria papillata. Bio-ZnNPs were described using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-visible spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction (XRD). Five groups of mice were applied: a control group (uninfected), a Bio-ZnNPs group (uninfected, receiving 50 mg/kg of Bio-ZnNPs), an infection group (untreated, infected with 103 sporulated oocysts), an INF + Bio-ZnNPs group (infected, treated with Bio-ZnNPs, 50 mg/kg), and an INF + AC group (infected, treated with amprolium, 120 mg/kg). The treatments lasted for 5 days. Bio-ZnNPs were spherical, averaging 35.79 ± 7.47 nm in diameter, with a peak absorption at 300.06 nm and four diffraction peaks in the XRD spectrum. An increased excretion of oocysts was found in the INF mice group. Notable jejunal histopathological anomalies were marked by an elevation in total endogenous parasitic oocysts. There was also an increase in immunohistochemical (IHC) staining intensity of caspase-3 and enhanced antioxidant and apoptotic activity. Treatment with Bio-ZnNPs reduced oocyst excretion, improved jejunal mucosal status, and significantly decreased total parasitic stages. Post-treatment, caspase-3 levels and its IHC expression decreased, and jejunal GPX levels declined. Apoptotic gene expression showed a significant downregulation of caspase-3 and BAX, with BCL2 upregulation. Overall, Bio-ZnNPs effectively suppressed E. papillata proliferation in infected mice, suggesting their potential utility in the treatment of eimeriosis."

In this study, selenium- and zinc-biofortified bean sprouts (ZSB) were cultivated, and the intervention effect on cognitive dysfunction was explored in aging mice model established by combining AlCl3 and d-galactose treatment. The results showed that compared with the model group, ZSB could decrease the accumulation of Al and increase the accumulation of Zn and Se in mice. The levels of serum superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase in liver and glutathione and acetylcholine in brain were significantly increased (p < 0.05) after the treatments of biofortified bean sprouts. Additionally, biofortified bean sprouts treatment reduced the level of lipid peroxidation and inhibited the deposition of Aβ1-40 in brain and the activity of acetylcholinesterase. It could also increase the abundance of lactic acid bacteria in cecum and inhibit the proliferation of Escherichia coli, and then the content of short-chain fatty acids was increased. More importantly, hippocampal neuron damage was reversed, and the correct rate of spontaneous behavior alternations was increased by 35% after the intervention of biofortified bean sprouts. Overall, ZSB can effectively slow down aging process through a variety of ways, which provide countermeasures for delaying aging.",

      "abstract": "Zinc is the second most abundant trace mineral in the human body and plays a critical role in immune cell function and metabolism. Zinc deficiency impairs immune cell function and is associated with increased susceptibility to respiratory diseases, including pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19. Zinc homeostasis, maintained by numerous zinc transporters and metal-binding proteins (ie, metallothionein), is essential for coordinating immune cell signaling, gene expression, and enzymatic activities in response to respiratory infections. This article highlights the emerging role of zinc in various aspects of immune function, particularly through its influence on cellular metabolism. Given the significant global burden of respiratory diseases, there is a need to identify effective nutritional interventions that could be readily leveraged to prevent and/or mitigate respiratory disease risk, particularly in older adults who are prone to zinc deficiency. However, the immunometabolic mechanisms underlying zinc's protective effects remain poorly characterized. Future research should focus on elucidating how micronutrients, such as zinc, can support changes in immune cell metabolism in response to infections. Such efforts will help determine how zinc metabolism and zinc intervention strategies may best be leveraged to prevent or mitigate respiratory disease."
