      "abstract": "Neurofeedback (NF), a form of biofeedback, is used to enhance the self-regulation of brain functions by assessing brain activity and delivering feedback signals to ameliorate emotional attributes, cognitive functions, and behaviors. Despite the potential role of NF in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, a number of gaps such as variations in NF methods persist. This study aims to address such gaps and present comprehensive insights into EEG and fMRI-NF applications in SUD management. This study has been conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. The search spanned four major databases: Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Embase. The search terms encompassed \"Neurofeedback\" OR \"EEG biofeedback\" OR \"neurotherapy\" OR \"Functional near-infrared spectroscopy Neurofeedback\" OR \"fNIRS-Neurofeedback\" AND addiction OR Drug OR \"substance dependence\" OR \"substance abuse\" OR Heroin OR Opioid OR Cannabis OR Marihuana OR Cocaine OR Crack OR Amphetamine OR Methamphetamine OR Hallucinogen. Our systematic review yielded 32 articles, including 18 EEG-, 11 fMRI-neurofeedback, and 3 fNIRS-neurofeedback studies. The primary outcome was reduced drug craving and some aspects of mental health and EEG-NF studies consistently indicated a preference for the alpha-theta protocol, whereas the high heterogeneity among fMRI-NF protocols limited direct comparisons. In conclusion, the results of this systematic review indicate that NF shows promise as an adjunctive intervention for treating SUD."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate which brain activity frequency of electroencephalogram (EEG)-neurofeedback training (NFT) was the most effective for enhancing working memory (WM) and episodic memory (EM) in healthy participants through network meta-analysis (NMA). METHODS: Searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for studies published from January 1990 to January 2025. We performed Bayesian NMA, pooling continuous outcome data using the standardized mean difference effect size (ES). Global and local evaluations of inconsistency were conducted using the chi-square test, side-splitting, and loop-specific approaches. A consistency model was applied and the global approach to inconsistency showed no significance. Efficacy ranks were determined using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) for each intervention. Publication bias was assessed using the comparison-adjusted funnel plot and Egger's test. Finally, sensitivity analysis confirmed our findings' robustness. RESULTS: Sixty studies were included, comprising 50 trials on WM and 24 trials on EM. While the global inconsistency analysis showed no significant inconsistency for WM (χ2(22) = 30.89, p = 0.10) and EM (χ2(10) = 13.48, p = 0.19), the consistency model exhibited the most significant difference between active control (AC) and alpha combined with working memory training (WMT) (ES of 6.64, p < 0.001) for WM, and between AC and alpha (ES of 0.84, p = 0.01) for EM. Alpha combined with WMT for WM (100%) and alpha NFT for EM (87.0%) also showed the highest efficacy according to the SUCRA. No publication bias was found for either type of memory. The sensitivity analysis for WM and EM aligns with the original results. CONCLUSION: Through NMA, alpha activity (7-13 Hz) may be a crucial frequency impacting memory. Brain activity combined with other training methods requires more robust studies for future investigation. This study registered with www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/ (CRD42024539656).",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To approach the evaluation of relative α variant score monitored by bedside continuous electroencephalography and optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) evaluated by ultrasound in patients with ischemic hypoxic encephalopathy, and to observe the effect of neurofeedback training on brain function. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted. The patients admitted to the emergency and intensive care department of Shanghai Pudong New Area People's Hospital from January 2021 to December 2023, who meet the diagnostic criteria of ischemic hypoxic encephalopathy with the Glasgow coma score (GCS) ≤ 8 at admission receiving neurofeedback training were enrolled as the study object (observation group), and the patients without neurofeedback training and GCS score ≤ 8 at admission were enrolled as the controls (control group). Both groups received intravenous neurotrophic therapy combining ganglioside and cerebrolysin for 10 days as one course of treatment. On this basis, the observation group additionally received continuous neurofeedback training including visual feedback, auditory feedback, meditation and relaxation for 14 days. Bedside continuous electroencephalography was used for monitoring relative α variation score, and ultrasound was used to determine ONSD. The average power and slow wave power [expressed as delta-theta ratio (DTR)] of five channels in electroencephalography before and 14 days after neurofeedback training were examined. The differences in peripheral blood neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) score, National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score, plasma levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were enrolled in the observation group and 50 patients in the control group finally. There was no significant difference in gender, age or course of disease between the two groups. The ONSD and relative α variant score in the observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group [ONDS (mm): 5.59±0.42 vs. 3.23±0.34, relative α variant score: 2.28±0.39 vs. 0.83±0.28, both P < 0.01]. After neurofeedback training for 14 days, the mean power and DTR in five channels of electroencephalography in the observation group were significantly lower than those before treatment [mean power (μV2/Hz): 95.35±3.61 vs. 102.58±4.23 in frontal pole 1 (Fp1), 38.56±4.73 vs. 46.13±2.36 in frontal 3 (F3), 34.33±5.87 vs. 51.71±4.65 in central 3 (C3), 58.37±4.45 vs. 62.95±3.22 in F7, 45.23±2.41 vs. 54.14±2.45 in temporal 3 (T3); DTR (μV2/Hz): 75.21±11.34 vs. 84.12±11.35 in ground electrode (GND), 72.31±21.67 vs. 88.23±10.25 in reference electrode (REF), 81.34±8.57 vs. 92.41±8.56 in F4, 71.25±5.42 vs. 87.23±5.64 in parietal 3 (P3), 70.12±5.88 vs. 85.67±6.12 in P4; all P < 0.05]. However, there was no significant difference in the mean power of five channels before and after treatment in the control group. There was no significant difference in the HAMD score or NIHSS score before treatment between the two groups. The above scores at 14 days after treatment were significantly lower than before, and the decrease was more significant in the observation group (HAMD score: 4.59±1.06 vs. 10.69±0.97, NIHSS score: 6.81±0.66 vs. 8.45±0.87, both P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the plasma 5-HT, BDNF or peripheral blood NLR before treatment between the two groups. The above parameters at 14 days after treatment were improved as compared with before, and the levels in the observation group were superior to control group [5-HT (mg/L): 150.25±17.37 vs. 123.34±16.18, BDNF (mg/L): 19.37±2.35 vs. 12.48±2.18, NLR: 4.78±0.83 vs. 5.81±1.17, all P < 0.01]. CONCLUSIONS: Both ONDS determined by ultrasound and relative α variation score monitored by electroencephalography changed significantly in the patients with ischemic hypoxic encephalopathy. Neurofeedback training can effectively improve brain function in patients with ischemic hypoxic encephalopathy.",

Thirty-two participants in clinical remission from depression or anxiety were enrolled and evaluated for insomnia severity. Individuals were randomly assigned in a single-blinded manner to either NFT or the sham treatment. The effectiveness of the intervention was measured using recognized scales for depression, anxiety and sleep quality. While subjective sleep quality, measured by the PSQI, showed significant improvements in the active group compared to the sham group at post training, 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up, objective measures of sleep quality largely remained within the normal range, with few significant changes observed. Specifically, the active group exhibited notable improvements in alpha amplitude and duration during NFT sessions, which were not seen in the sham group. This highlights the potential of NFT as a complementary approach for improving sleep perception in this population, but further research is needed to confirm its effects on actual sleep architecture and long-term outcomes.",

The aim of clinical trials is to compare the effects of cognitive functional therapy (CFT) and neurofeedback training (NFBT) on gait kinetics in chronic non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty females with chronic non-specific low back pain were recruitment for clinical trials. They were randomly divided into experimental and one control groups (Each group 20 patients). The experimental group received the relevant interventions for eight weeks. The primary outcome was pain, kinesiophobia and disability. The secondary outcome was vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) parameters. Two-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA statistical method was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Within-group comparisons showed that neurofeedback training and cognitive functional therapy groups experienced significant improvement in pain intensity, disability and kinesiophobia after eight-week (p < 0.05). However, the cognitive functional therapy group improved the vertical ground reaction force parameters better than the neurofeedback training group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: cognitive functional therapy intervention had a greater effect on the vertical ground reaction force parameters. The reason for the greater effect of cognitive functional therapy intervention on vertical ground reaction force parameters can be partially explained due to the multimodal therapy used through cognitive exercises and motor control."

      "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with an unclear pathogenesis to date. Neurofeedback (NFB) had shown therapeutic effects in patients with ASD. In this study,we analyzed the brain functional networks of children with ASD and investigated the impact of NFB targeting the beta rhythm training on these networks. The Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) and Social Response Scale (SRS) were employed to evaluate the effects of NFB training on the behavioral abilities of children with ASD. We compared the differences in static and dynamic brain functional networks between ASD and Typically Developing (TD) children, also explored the changes in these networks in ASD children after 20 sessions of NFB training. The Weighted Phase Lag Index (wPLI) was used to construct static functional networks, and the Fuzzy Entropy (FuzzyEn) algorithm was further employed to measure the complexity of static functional connectivity and construct dynamic functional networks. This allowed the analysis of functional connectivity and fluctuations in the static functional networks of ASD and TD children, as well as the time variability of the dynamic functional networks. Additionally, the study explored the changes in brain functional networks and behavioral scales before and after NFB training. Results from behavioral scales indicated significant improvements in cognitive, communication, language, and social scores in ASD children following NFB intervention. EEG analysis revealed that static functional connectivity was lower, connectivity variability was higher, and temporal variability was greater in ASD children compared to TD children. Following NFB training, increased functional connectivity, reduced connectivity variability in the Delta frequency band, and decreased temporal variability were observed in ASD children. The results revealed abnormalities in both static and dynamic functional networks in children with ASD, with NFB training showed potential to modulate these networks. While our results showed that NFB training can assist participants in regulating connectivity and temporal variability in specific brain regions, robust evidence for its effectiveness in alleviating core symptoms of ASD remained limited.",

      "abstract": "Operational environments are characterized by a range of psycho-physiological constraints that can degrade combatants' performance and impact on their long-term health. Neurofeedback training (NFT), a non-invasive, safe and effective means of regulating brain activity, has been shown to be effective for mental disorders, as well as for cognitive and motor capacities and aiding sports performance in healthy individuals. Its value in helping soldiers in operational condition or suffering from post-traumatic stress (PTSD) is undeniable, but relatively unexplored. The aim of this narrative review is to show the applicability of NFT to enhance cognitive performance and to treat (or manage) PTSD symptoms in the military context. It provides an overview of NFT use cases before, during or after military operations, and in the treatment of soldiers suffering from PTSD. The position of NFT within the broad spectrum of performance enhancement techniques, as well as several key factors influencing the effectiveness of NFT are discussed. Finally, suggestions for the use of NFT in the military context (pre-training environments, and during and post-deployments to combat zones or field operations), future research directions, recommendations and caveats (e.g., on transfer to operational situations, inter-individual variability in responsiveness) are offered. This review is thus expected to draw clear perspectives for both researchers and armed forces regarding NFT for cognitive performance enhancement and PTSD treatment related to the military context."

Method: Shooting scores and EEG activity in the left and right temporal regions were collected from 20 healthy air pistol shooters (10 assigned to neurofeedback training) before and after a 16-session intervention completed within 6 weeks. Specifically, EEG low-alpha (8-10 hz), high-alpha (10-13 hz) power, and coherence obtained at the T3-Fz and T4-Fz recording sites over three consecutive 1-s intervals prior to trigger pull, were subjected to three separate 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 (Group x Hemisphere x Time x Epoch) ANOVAs. Results: The neurofeedback group exhibited elevated low- and high-alpha EEG power across both temporal regions, but no differences in EEG broad-band alpha coherence, accompanied by enhanced performance after the intervention compared to the control group. Conclusions: The findings support the influence of neurofeedback training on cerebral cortical arousal and performance of a precision-aiming task, however, the influence of the neurofeedback on brain dynamics (i.e. alpha power) extended beyond the targeted region as a nonspecific manifestation of cerebral cortical inhibition leading to neural efficiency at the homologous sites."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The rise in the number of children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) highlights the need for effective interventions targeting attentional control. Although recent research has demonstrated the potential of neurofeedback training (NFT) for children with ADHD, most studies have been conducted in laboratory settings, raising questions about their real-world applicability. To address this issue, virtual reality (VR) may offer a solution to the ecological validity challenges encountered in NFT. By coupling NFT with VR, individuals can engage in self-regulating brain activity within a simulated, realistic environment. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-based NFT combined with VR in alleviating ADHD symptoms among children, addressing the need for interventions with practical relevance and effectiveness. METHODS: This study aims to recruit 138 children aged 7-12 diagnosed with ADHD. Following baseline assessment, participants will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) NIRS-based NFT in a VR classroom setting; (2) conventional computerised cognitive training (active control) or (3) a waitlist control group. On completion of intervention sessions in the two training groups, all groups will undergo an assessment at time 2, with a follow-up assessment scheduled 2 months post-training for all participants. Primary outcomes will include measures of executive function, such as attentional control, response inhibition and working memory, along with changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin levels monitored by functional NIRS. Secondary outcome measures will comprise ratings of children's ADHD symptoms and executive function behaviours in daily life, reported by parents and teachers. DISCUSSION: The three-arm randomised controlled trial will address research gaps regarding the effectiveness of NIRS-based NFT for children with ADHD, particularly when integrated with immersive VR technology. By combining NFT and VR, this study aims to simulate a real-world environment, potentially amplifying intervention effects. The findings from the study will provide evidence for the efficacy of this innovative intervention in improving executive function and alleviating ADHD symptoms. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee at the University of Hong Kong (Reference: EA200247). Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05906485.",

      "abstract": "Objective. Current research on the effectiveness of neurofeedback (NFB) in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is divided. Personalized NFB (pNFB), using pre-recorded individual electroencephalogram (EEG) features, is hypothesized to provide more reliable results. Our paper reviews available evidence on pNFB effectiveness and its methodological quality. Additionally, it explores whether other methodological features implying personalization are related to successful NFB. Methods. We conducted a systematic literature review on PubMed, PSYNDEX, PsycInfo and PsycArticles until November, 30, 2023. Studies that focused on pNFB in children with ADHD were selected, deviant studies excluded. Quality ratings by independent raters using Loney's1 criteria were conducted. Pooled effect sizes for NFB effects and methodological features were calculated. Results. Three of 109 studies included personalization and were reviewed in the full-text. In two studies, theta/beta-NFB was personalized using individual alpha peak frequencies (iAPF), whereas in one study, individual beta rhythms were trained. All three studies demonstrated significant short- and long-term improvements in ADHD symptoms, as assessed by questionnaires and objective performance tests, when compared to standard protocols (SP), sham-NFB, and control conditions. Twelve of 111 studies reported methodological features consistently related to NFB effectiveness. These features, including self-control instructions, feedback animations, timing of feedback presentation, behavioral performance, pre-recorded individual ERP-components and stimulant medication dosage, can be used to personalize NFB and enhance training success. Conclusion. Personalizing NFB with iAPF appears promising based on the existing -albeit small- body of research. Future NFB studies should include iAPF and other personalized features facilitating implementation consistently associated with treatment success.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether Infra-low frequency Neurofeedback (ILF-NFB) training can improve brain electrical activity in children with autism spectrum disorders ASD. METHOD: This single arm pre and post intervention study was carried out at IBMS (Institute of Basic Medical Sciences), Khyber Medical University, Peshawar and Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University (SZABMU), Islamabad from January 2021 to December 2022. A purposive sampling technique was used. Thirty-five ASD children (male=24; female=11; 7-17 years) were provided with 30 sessions of infra low frequency (ILF) neurofeedback training for 15-20 minutes, during 10 weeks. Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) scoring was done and electroencephalogram (EEG) activity was compared before and after ILF-NF training sessions. RESULTS: Around 62.9% participants had mild-moderate autism and 37.1% had severe autism. Wilcoxon Signed rank test revealed a significant decline in delta (Pre-test=47.31±19.22, Post-test=22.07±6.83; p=<0.001), theta (Pre-test=24.75±16.62, Post-test=12.37±3.59; p=<0.001) and alpha (Pre-test=12.01±9.81, Post-test=4.03±1.61; p=< 0.001) waves. Mann Whitney U test exhibited no significant gender differences in EEG pattern before and after neurofeedback except in theta waves (p=0.03) before the intervention. CONCLUSION: Decline in delta, theta, beta and alpha waves propose that ILF-NF training can be effective in improving the EEG activity. ILF-NFB can be perceived as a valuable non-invasive, non-pharmacological intervention for improving EEG pattern via reintegration of brain activity resulting in increased the attention and focus, enhanced mental stability and cognitive engagement."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Aberrant movement-related cortical activity has been linked to impaired motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD). Dopaminergic drug treatment can restore these, but dosages and long-term treatment are limited by adverse side-effects. Effective non-pharmacological treatments could help reduce reliance on drugs. This experiment reports the first study of home-based electroencephalographic (EEG) neurofeedback training as a non-pharmacological candidate treatment for PD. Our primary aim was to test the feasibility of our EEG neurofeedback intervention in a home setting. METHODS: Sixteen people with PD received six home visits comprising symptomology self-reports, a standardised motor assessment, and a precision handgrip force production task while EEG was recorded (visits 1, 2 and 6); and 3 × 1-hr EEG neurofeedback training sessions to supress the EEG mu rhythm before initiating handgrip movements (visits 3 to 5). RESULTS: Participants successfully learned to self-regulate mu activity, and this appeared to expedite the initiation of precision movements (i.e., time to reach target handgrip force off-medication pre-intervention = 628 ms, off-medication post-intervention = 564 ms). There was no evidence of wider symptomology reduction (e.g., Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III Motor Examination, off-medication pre-intervention = 29.00, off-medication post intervention = 30.07). Interviews indicated that the intervention was well-received. CONCLUSION: Based on the significant effect of neurofeedback on movement-related cortical activity, positive qualitative reports from participants, and a suggestive benefit to movement initiation, we conclude that home-based neurofeedback for people with PD is a feasible and promising non-pharmacological treatment that warrants further research.",

      "abstract": "Hippocampal replay - the time-compressed, sequential reactivation of ensembles of neurons related to past experience - is a key neural mechanism of memory consolidation. Replay typically coincides with a characteristic pattern of local field potential activity, the sharp-wave ripple (SWR). Reduced SWR rates are associated with cognitive impairment in multiple models of neurodegenerative disease, suggesting that a clinically viable intervention to promote SWRs and replay would prove beneficial. We therefore developed a neurofeedback paradigm for rat subjects in which SWR detection triggered rapid positive feedback in the context of a memory-dependent task. This training protocol increased the prevalence of task-relevant replay during the targeted neurofeedback period by changing the temporal dynamics of SWR occurrence. This increase was also associated with neural and behavioral forms of compensation after the targeted period. These findings reveal short-timescale regulation of SWR generation and demonstrate that neurofeedback is an effective strategy for modulating hippocampal replay.",

Each student who took part in the study was tested at the beginning and at the end of the schoolyear. Students from the experimental group significantly improved their performance in the task related to sustained attention to simple stimuli.

This study tested ILF-NFT's effects in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled longitudinal context in healthy psychology students. Across five weeks, forty-two healthy psychology students (aged 18-35) were randomly allocated into two groups, receiving ten sessions of 30 minutes of active and sham ILF-NFT. Dependent variables were measured before, following, and two months after the intervention and were comprised of: heartrate variability assessments as a measure of stress resilience; digit span, n-back, trail making and go-no-go task measures of executive functioning performance; and SCL-90-R, WHOQOL-Bref, and peak performance measures of subjective self-report. Statistical analysis was performed using an ANCOVA and compared across groups correcting for baseline differences and multiple comparisons. ANCOVA analyses revealed no significant differences across active and placebo groups in any dependent variables, when correcting for multiple comparisons. Thus, the remaining analyses focused on questionnaire correlations. Here, significant correlations were observed between the novel peak performance questionnaire with the SCL-90-R and WHOQOL-Bref, confirming its construct and retest validity. Despite several methodological limitations, including a potential type-2 error, this study highlights limited effects of ILF-NFT in healthy volunteers. Future research should thus focus on clinically driven experimental designs to explore ILF-NFT's potential in psychiatric contexts. Further research utilization of the novel peak performance questionnaire is recommended for measures of peak performance.",

      "abstract": "Neurofeedback training (NFT) is a promising adjuvant intervention method. The desynchronization of mu rhythm (8-13 Hz) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) over centro-parietal areas is known as a valid indicator of mirror neuron system (MNS) activation, which has been associated with social skills. Still, the effect of neurofeedback training on the MNS requires to be well investigated. The present study examined the possible impact of NFT with a mu suppression training protocol encompassing 15 NFT sessions (45 min each) on 16 healthy neurotypical participants. In separate pre- and post-training sessions, 64-channel EEG was recorded while participants (1) observed videos with various types of movements (including complex goal-directed hand movements and social interaction scenes) and (2) performed the \"Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test\" (RMET). EEG source reconstruction analysis revealed statistically significant mu suppression during hand movement observation across MNS-attributed fronto-parietal areas after NFT. The frequency analysis showed no significant mu suppression after NFT, despite the fact that numerical mu suppression appeared to be visible in a majority of participants during goal-directed hand movement observation. At the behavioral level, RMET accuracy scores did not suggest an effect of NFT on the ability to interpret subtle emotional expressions, although RMET response times were reduced after NFT. In conclusion, the present study exhibited preliminary and partial evidence that mu suppression NFT can induce mu suppression in MNS-attributed areas. More powerful experimental designs and longer training may be necessary to induce substantial and consistent mu suppression, particularly while observing social scenarios.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Electroencephalographic neurofeedback (NFB), as a non-invasive form of brainwave training, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of various mental health disorders. However, only few results regarding manualised and standardised NFB trainings exist. This makes comparison as well as replication of studies difficult. Therefore, we developed a standard manual for NFB training in patients with mental health disorders attending a psychosomatic outpatient clinic. The current study aims at investigating the conduction of a standardised manual for NFB training in patients with mental health disorders. If successful, the study provides new opportunities to investigate NFB in a more controlled and comparable manner in clinical practice. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 30 patients diagnosed with a mental health disorder will be included. After the educational interview, patients will undergo baseline diagnostics (T0). The subsequent intervention consists of 10 sessions of NFB training aiming at increasing sensorimotor rhythm and alpha-frequency amplitudes and decreasing theta-frequency and high beta-frequency amplitudes to induce relaxation and decrease subjective stress. All patients will undergo a post-treatment diagnostic assessment (T1) and a follow-up assessment 8 weeks following the closing session (T2). Changes in amplitude bands (primary outcome) will be recorded with electroencephalography during pre-assessments, post-assessments and follow-up assessments and during NFB sessions. Physiological (respiratory rate, blood volume pulse, muscle tension) and psychometric parameters (distress, perceived stress, relaxation ability, depressive and anxiety symptoms, insomnia, self-efficacy and quality of life) will be assessed at T0, T1 and T2. Moreover, satisfaction, acceptance and usability will be assessed at T1 after NFB training. Further, qualitative interviews about the experiences with the intervention will be conducted with NFB practitioners 6 months after the study starts. Quantitative data will be analysed using repeated measures analysis of variance as well as mediation analyses on mixed linear models. Qualitative data will be analysed using Mayring's content analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Duisburg-Essen (23-11140-BO) and patient enrolment began in April 2023. Before participation, written informed consent by each participant will be required. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Electroencephalography (EEG) stands as a pivotal non-invasive tool, capturing brain signals with millisecond precision and enabling real-time monitoring of individuals' mental states. Using appropriate biomarkers extracted from these EEG signals and presenting them back in a neurofeedback loop offers a unique avenue for promoting neural compensation mechanisms. This approach empowers individuals to skillfully modulate their brain activity. Recent years have witnessed the identification of neural biomarkers associated with aging, underscoring the potential of neuromodulation to regulate brain activity in the elderly. METHODS AND OBJECTIVES: Within the framework of an EEG-based brain-computer interface, this study focused on three neural biomarkers that may be disturbed in the aging brain: Peak Alpha Frequency, Gamma-band synchronization, and Theta/Beta ratio. The primary objectives were twofold: (1) to investigate whether elderly individuals with subjective memory complaints can learn to modulate their brain activity, through EEG-neurofeedback training, in a rigorously designed double-blind, placebo-controlled study; and (2) to explore potential cognitive enhancements resulting from this neuromodulation. RESULTS: A significant self-modulation of the Gamma-band synchronization biomarker, critical for numerous higher cognitive functions and known to decline with age, and even more in Alzheimer's disease (AD), was exclusively observed in the group undergoing EEG-neurofeedback training. This effect starkly contrasted with subjects receiving sham feedback. While this neuromodulation did not directly impact cognitive abilities, as assessed by pre- versus post-training neuropsychological tests, the high baseline cognitive performance of all subjects at study entry likely contributed to this result. CONCLUSION: The findings of this double-blind study align with a key criterion for successful neuromodulation, highlighting the significant potential of Gamma-band synchronization in such a process. This important outcome encourages further exploration of EEG-neurofeedback on this specific neural biomarker as a promising intervention to counter the cognitive decline that often accompanies brain aging and, eventually, to modify the progression of AD.",

DESIGN: Clinical trial following an AB/BA crossover design with counterbalanced assignment. SUBJECTS: Twenty individuals with subacute (n = 4) or chronic stroke (n = 16). METHODS: Ten consecutive sessions of bilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation alone (therapy A) were compared vs a combination of10 consecutive sessions of bilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation with 12 non-consecutive sessions of motor imagery-based neurofeedback training (therapy B). Patients received both therapies (1-month washout period), in sequence AB or BA. Participants were assessed before and after each therapy and at 15-days follow-up, using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-upper limb, hand-grip strength, and the Nottingham Sensory Assessment as primary outcome measures. RESULTS: Both therapies resulted in improved functionality and sensory function. Therapy B consistently exhibited superior effects compared with therapy A, according to Fugl-Meyer Assessment and tactile and kinaesthetic sensory function across multiple time-points, irrespective of treatment sequence. No statistically significant differences between therapies were found for hand-grip strength. CONCLUSION: Following subacute and chronic stroke, integrating bilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and motor imagery-based neurofeedback training has the potential to enhance functional performance compared with using bilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation alone in upper limb recovery.",

      "abstract": "Working memory (WM) represents a building-block of higher cognitive functions and a wide range of mental disorders are associated with WM impairments. Initial studies have shown that several sessions of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) informed real-time neurofeedback (NF) allow healthy individuals to volitionally increase activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a region critically involved in WM. For the translation to therapeutic or neuroenhancement applications, however, it is critical to assess whether fNIRS-NF success transfers into neural and behavioral WM enhancement in the absence of feedback. We therefore combined single-session fNIRS-NF of the left DLPFC with a randomized sham-controlled design (N = 62 participants) and a subsequent WM challenge with concomitant functional MRI. Over four runs of fNIRS-NF, the left DLPFC NF training group demonstrated enhanced neural activity in this region, reflecting successful acquisition of neural self-regulation. During the subsequent WM challenge, we observed no evidence for performance differences between the training and the sham group. Importantly, however, examination of the fMRI data revealed that - compared to the sham group - the training group exhibited significantly increased regional activity in the bilateral DLPFC and decreased left DLPFC - left anterior insula functional connectivity during the WM challenge. Exploratory analyses revealed a negative association between DLPFC activity and WM reaction times in the NF group. Together, these findings indicate that healthy individuals can learn to volitionally increase left DLPFC activity in a single training session and that the training success translates into WM-related neural activation and connectivity changes in the absence of feedback. This renders fNIRS-NF as a promising and scalable WM intervention approach that could be applied to various mental disorders.",

METHODS: : The participants were 74 children with ADHD aged 8-15 years who visited the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Seoul National University Children's Hospital. The participants were randomly assigned to the mobile neurofeedback (n = 35) or control (sham; n = 39) group. Neurofeedback training was administered using a mobile app (equipped with a headset with a 2-channel electroencephalogram [EEG] sensor) for 30 min/day, 3 days/week, for 3 months. Children with ADHD were individually administered various neuropsychological tests, including the continuous performance test, Children's Color Trails Test-1 and 2, and Stroop Color and Word Tests. The effects of mobile neurofeedback were evaluated at baseline and at 3 and 6 months after treatment initiation. RESULTS: : Following treatment, both mobile neurofeedback-only and sham-only groups showed significant improvements in attention and response inhibition. In the visual continuous performance test, omission errors decreased to the normal range in the mobile neurofeedback-only group after training, suggesting that mobile neurofeedback effectively reduced inattention in children with ADHD. In the advanced test of attention, auditory response times decreased in the mobile neurofeedback + medication group after training, but increased in the sham+medication group. Overall, there were no significant between-group differences in other performance outcomes. CONCLUSION: : Mobile neurofeedback may have potential as an additional therapeutic option alongside medication for children with ADHD."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neurofeedback training (NFT) can aid in the treatment of the abnormal patterns of the brain brought on by physical injury, enhancing cognitive and behavioral abilities. The present study aimed to compare the effectiveness of combining neuromuscular training (NMT) and NFT (NMT+NFT) with NMT alone in rehabilitating athletes with chronic ankle instability (CAI). HYPOTHESIS: NMT+NFT will be more effective than NMT alone. STUDY DESIGN: A 3-arm, single-blind randomized controlled trial. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 2. METHODS: A total number of 62 athletes, aged 18 to 25 years, with CAI, participated in this study. The study subjects were allocated randomly to 3 groups: 21 cases in the control group, 21 cases in the combination group (CG) receiving NMT+NFT, and 20 cases in the neuromuscular group (NG) practicing NMT alone, undergoing exercises related to their groups for 8 weeks. Data were recorded and analyzed before and after the 8-week training program. The primary outcome measures were postural sway indices; secondary outcomes included ankle proprioception and biopsychosocial indices. RESULTS: NMT+NFT was more effective than NMT alone in terms of improving postural control during single- and 2-legged standing positions under the conditions of eyes closed and eyes open, proprioception at 20° of plantar flexion, as well as anxiety and depression in athletes with CAI. However, the findings revealed that NMT+NFT and NMT alone could both improve such indices. CONCLUSION: NMT+NFT as a treatment protocol improved postural control, ankle proprioception, anxiety, and depression greater than NMT alone. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A combined protocol of NFT and NMT led to greater improvement compared with NMT alone. NFT was recommended as an adjunct therapy in the rehabilitation of athletes suffering from CAI.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The modulation of brain circuits of emotion is a promising pathway to treat borderline personality disorder (BPD). Precise and scalable approaches have yet to be established. Two studies investigating the amygdala-related electrical fingerprint (Amyg-EFP) in BPD are presented: one study addressing the deep-brain correlates of Amyg-EFP, and a second study investigating neurofeedback (NF) as a means to improve brain self-regulation. METHODS: Study 1 combined electroencephalography (EEG) and simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the replicability of Amyg-EFP-related brain activation found in the reference dataset (N = 24 healthy subjects, 8 female; re-analysis of published data) in the replication dataset (N = 16 female individuals with BPD). In the replication dataset, we additionally explored how the Amyg-EFP would map to neural circuits defined by the research domain criteria. Study 2 investigated a 10-session Amyg-EFP NF training in parallel to a 12-weeks residential dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) program. Fifteen patients with BPD completed the training, N = 15 matched patients served as DBT-only controls. RESULTS: Study 1 replicated previous findings and showed significant amygdala blood oxygenation level dependent activation in a whole-brain regression analysis with the Amyg-EFP. Neurocircuitry activation (negative affect, salience, and cognitive control) was correlated with the Amyg-EFP signal. Study 2 showed Amyg-EFP modulation with NF training, but patients received reversed feedback for technical reasons, which limited interpretation of results. CONCLUSIONS: Recorded via scalp EEG, the Amyg-EFP picks up brain activation of high relevance for emotion. Administering Amyg-EFP NF in addition to standardized BPD treatment was shown to be feasible. Clinical utility remains to be investigated.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Personality disorders are serious psychiatric conditions, and some studies have examined neurofeedback training as a potential alternative treatment to improve cognitive and clinical symptoms in patients with such disorders. Here, we aimed to provide a first systematic review of such trials and present existing evidence regarding this treatment for individuals with personality disorders. Method : A systematic search of peer-reviewed English journal articles was conducted for this study to identify original studies on fMRI and EEG neurofeedback treatment protocols in patients with personality disorders up to January 2023. PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases were queried through the keywords \"neurofeedback,\" \"biofeedback,\" and \"personality disorder,\" as well as their related Mesh synonyms. Results: Totally, five studies were included in our systematic review. Two studies utilized EEG neurofeedback protocols, while three articles used real-time fMRI neurofeedback protocols. The types of studies were non-randomized, not-blinded case reports, case series, and single-arm trials with a high risk of bias. EEG neurofeedback protocols applied more training sessions and reported improvements in patients' neuropsychological and behavioral functions after treatment. Furthermore, fMRI-based neurofeedback studies reported neurophysiological changes, such as a shift in vmPFC-amygdala connectivity, towards healthy states following treatment. Moreover, behavioral symptoms of patients were reported to be improved after fMRI neurofeedback. Conclusion: Neurofeedback studies investigating this therapeutic technique for personality disorders are still very preliminary, and no strict conclusions can be drawn at this time. Therefore, further basic and clinical investigations are required to address several open methodological and technical questions and establish consensus and standardization, which will eventually lead to translational works."

      "abstract": "A large number of previous studies have examined how different neurofeedback-based techniques may influence motor learning. However, only a few studies attempted to compare the effects of these different techniques on motor learning. Therefore, the present study attempts to examine the effects of neurofeedback training on motor learning in novice golfers, using three protocols, namely enhanced sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) at Cz, suppressed alpha waves at Fz, and suppressed mu waves at Cz. The participants were 64 adults (32 females; mean age = 22.31 ± 2.25 years). The study consisted of a pretest stage (day 1), intervention (6 sessions, over two weeks, 3 sessions per week), short-term retention (one day after intervention), and long-term retention (two weeks after intervention); in the pretest and short-term and long-term retention, motor performance for golf putting (12 trials) as well as amplitudes of SMR wave at Cz, alpha at Fz, and Mu at Cz were recorded. During each intervention session, the participants in three neurofeedback groups and a sham group first performed neurofeedback training (enhanced SMR at Cz, suppressed alpha at Fz, and suppressed Mu at Cz) for 20 min. Then, the participants in all groups performed three blocks of 12 trials consisting of golf putting training. The results indicated no difference between the sham and the experimental groups in the acquisition stage, as individuals in all groups experienced similar improvement in putting accuracy. However, in the short-term retention, all the three neurofeedback groups outperformed the sham group, although in the long-term retention, only the SMR group and the Alpha group showed a better performance than the sham group while the Mu group did not exhibit a notably better performance than the sham group. Our results also showed significant variations in the amplitudes of the SMR, alpha, and mu waves depending on the neurofeedback intervention provided, while no significant variation was observed in the sham group. Based on these results, it is recommended that coaches should make further use of enhanced SMR at Cz or suppressed alpha at Fz as their neurofeedback interventions to facilitate longer-term motor learning in golfers."

A total of 30 patients with acute stroke performed functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based neurofeedback training for a day to increase their prefrontal activity. A randomized, Sham-controlled, double-blind study protocol was used comparing working memory ability before and after neurofeedback training. Working memory was evaluated using a target-searching task requiring spatial information retention. A decline in spatial working memory performance post-intervention was prevented in patients who displayed a higher task-related right prefrontal activity during neurofeedback training compared with the baseline. Neurofeedback training efficacy was not associated with the patient's clinical background such as Fugl-Meyer Assessment score and time since stroke. These findings demonstrated that even short-term neurofeedback training can strengthen prefrontal activity and help maintain cognitive ability in acute stroke patients, at least immediately after training. However, further studies investigating the influence of individual patient clinical background, especially cognitive impairment, on neurofeedback training is needed. Current findings provide an encouraging option for clinicians to design neurorehabilitation programs, including neurofeedback protocols, for acute stroke patients."

Our results demonstrate that ILF-NFT has improved the patient's sleep disturbance, has significantly reduced seizure frequency and severity, and has reversed neurodevelopmental decline, with positive development in intellectual and motor skills. No significant changes have been made to the patient's medication in the observed period of 2.5 years. Thus, we draw attention to ILF-NFT as a promising intervention in addressing DS symptomatology. Finally, we discuss the study's methodological limitations and warrant future studies to assess the effect of ILF-NFT in DS in more elaborate research designs."

Home-based NF systems are available and might facilitate general access to NF training, especially when repeated training sessions are necessary. However, it remains an open question whether NF training at home is possible without remote monitoring. In the present study, we assessed the capacity of healthy individuals to modulate their own EEG activity when using a home-based NF training system in a comparable manner as if participants had purchased a commercially available NF system. Participants' face-to-face contact with experimenters was reduced to a minimum, and instructions were provided only in the form of written information or videos. Initially, 38 participants performed 9 sessions of sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) (12-15 Hz) based NF training (three generalization sessions, six training sessions). An active control group (n = 19) received feedback on random EEG frequencies. Because of technical problems, bad EEG data quality, or non-compliance, 21 participants had to be excluded from the final data analysis, providing first evidence for the difficulties of non-supervised home-based NF training. In this study, participants were not able to modulate their own brain activity in a desired direction during NF training. Our results indicate that personal interaction with a NF expert might be of relevance and that remote supervision of the training data and more direct communication with the NF users are necessary to enable successful NF training performance. We provide suggestions for the development and implementation of home-based NF systems."

However, its translation into clinical use on participants with clinical depression is unclear, the effect estimates from randomized control trials and the certainty of the supporting evidence on the effect estimates are unknown. As the number of studies on neurofeedback increases every year, and better quality evidence becomes available, we evaluate the evidence of all randomized control trials available on the clinical application of rt-fMRI-nf training on participants with clinical depression. We performed electronic searches in Pubmed, Embase, CENTRAL, rtFIN database, Epistemonikos, trial registers, reference lists, other systematic reviews, conference abstracts, and cross-citation in Google Scholar. Reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. The certainty of the evidence was judged using the GRADE framework. This review complies with PRISMA guidelines and was submitted to PROSPERO registration. We found 435 results. After the selection process, we included 11 reports corresponding to four RCTs. The effect of rt-fMRI-nf on improving the severity of clinical depression scores demonstrated a tendency to favor the intervention; however, the general effect was not significant. At end of treatment, SMD (standardized mean difference): -0.32 (95% CI -0.73 to 0.10). At follow-up, SMD: -0.33 (95% CI -0.91, 1.25). All the studies showed changes in BOLD fMRI activation after training; however, only one study confirmed regulation success during a transfer run. Whole-brain analyses suggests that rt-fMRI nf may alter activity patterns in brain networks. More studies are needed to evaluate quality of life, acceptability, adverse effects, cognitive tasks, and physiology measures. We conclude that the current evidence on the effect of rt-fMRI-nf training for decision-making outcomes in patients with clinical depression is still based on low certainty of the evidence."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood psychiatric disorders characterized by poor attention and subsequently lower learning abilities than normal children. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of neurofeedback and perceptual-motor exercises as two common nonpharmacological treatments for visual attention. METHODS: A total of 40 combined medicated ADHD children (aged 5-12 years) were randomly allocated into two groups: neurofeedback training and perceptual-motor exercises. Visual attention and motor proficiency were assessed before and after the treatment by continuous performance test (CPT) and Bruininks-Oseretsky Test (BOT), respectively. RESULTS: According to repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), both groups showed significant improvement in three attention-related areas of CPT, including reaction time, omission, and commission errors (P<0.001), while the difference between the two groups was not significant (P>0.05). However, in the perceptual-motor exercises group, motor proficiency improved significantly (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Neurofeedback training intervention, as well as perceptual-motor exercises, are effective in improving ADHD symptoms, and given the similar effect of both interventions and their lack of side effects, perceptual-motor exercises appear to be the more appropriate option for reducing symptoms of ADHD, because of its additional effect on motor proficiency, rich content of purposeful activities, and social interactions. HIGHLIGHTS: Neurofeedback training intervention promote attention in ADHD;Perceptual-motor exercises improve ADHD symptoms;Perceptual-motor exercises has an additional effect on motor proficiency. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: The effectiveness and cost of interventions is an important issue. The result of this study revealed although neuro-feedback training intervention as well as perceptual-motor exercises are effective in improving ADHD symptoms, perceptual-motor exercises seem more appropriate option for reducing symptoms of ADHD, due to its additional effect on motor proficiency."

This treatment is typically delivered as a complement to more traditional talk therapy such as trauma-focused-cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT). This review examined the evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention for children with trauma through a systematic search of the literature. A targeted search across databases identified 10 eligible studies that focused on children/young people who had experienced traumatic events and/or demonstrated symptoms of trauma, and which conducted a repeated measures study at a minimum. While the included studies suggest some benefits from neurofeedback training, the available studies, including randomized trials, have to date been relatively small, involve dramatically different treatment length and intensity, and show inconsistent benefits relative to usual treatment conditions. To advance knowledge of this intervention further research is needed with a clear best practice protocol and with a clearer target group."

Brain rhythms, the unique pattern in electroencephalogram (EEG), are widely used as the training target. Most of current studies used a fixed frequency division of brain rhythms, which ignores the individual developmental difference of each child. In this study, we validated the feasibility of NFT using individual beta rhythm. A total of 55 children with ADHD were divided into two groups using the relative power of individual or fixed beta rhythms as the training index. ADHD rating scale (ADHD-RS) was completed before and after NFT, and the EEG and behavioral features were extracted during the training process. After intervention, the attention ability of both groups was significantly improved, showing a significant increase in beta power, a decrease in scores of ADHD-RS and an improvement in behavioral and other EEG features. The training effect was significantly better with individualized beta training, showing more improvement in ADHD-RS scores. Furthermore, the distribution of brain rhythms moved towards high frequency after intervention. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of NFT based on individual beta rhythm for the intervention of children with ADHD. When designing a NFT protocol and the corresponding data analysis process, an individualized brain rhythm division should be applied to reflect the actual brain state and to accurately evaluate the effect of NFT."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neurofeedback (NF) is an important treatment for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In ADHD, cognitive control deficits pose considerable problems to patients. However, NF protocols are not yet optimized to enhance cognitive control alongside with clinical symptoms, partly because they are not driven by basic cognitive neuroscience. In this study, we evaluated different EEG theta and/or beta frequency band NF protocols designed to enhance cognitive control. Participants were n = 157 children and adolescents, n = 129 of them were patients with ADHD (n = 28 typically developing (TD) controls). Patients with ADHD were divided into five groups in the order of referral, with four of them taking part in different NF protocols systematically varying theta and beta power. The fifth ADHD group and the TD group did not undergo NF. All NF protocols resulted in reductions of ADHD symptoms. Importantly, only when beta frequencies were enhanced during NF (without any theta regulation or in combination with theta upregulation), consistent enhancing effects in both response inhibition and conflict control were achieved. The theta/beta NF protocol most widely used in clinical settings revealed comparatively limited effects. Enhancements in beta band activity are key when aiming to improve cognitive control functions in ADHD. This calls for a change in the use of theta/beta NF protocols and shows that protocols differing from the current clinical standard are effective in enhancing important facets of cognitive control in ADHD. Further studies need to examine regulation data within the neurofeedback sessions to provide more information about the mechanisms underlying the observed effects.

Participants (n = 60) were randomised to receive ISF-NF targeting either the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), dorsal anterior cingulate and somatosensory cortex (dACC + S1), ratio of pgACC*2/dACC + S1, or Sham-NF. Resting-state EEG and clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline, immediately after intervention, and at one-week and one-month follow-up. Kruskal-Wallis tests demonstrated significant between-group differences in effective connectivity from pgACC to S1L at one-month follow up and marginal significant changes from S1L to pgACC at one-week and one-month follow up. Mann-Whitney U tests demonstrated significant increases in effective connectivity in the ISF-NF up-training pgACC group when compared to the Sham-NF group (pgACC to S1L at one-month (p = 0.013), and S1L to pgACC at one-week (p = 0.008) and one-month follow up (p = 0.016)). Correlational analyses demonstrated a significant negative correlation (ρ = -0.630, p = 0.038) between effective connectivity changes from pgACC to S1L and changes in pain severity at one-month follow-up. The ISF-NF training pgACC can reduce pain via influencing effective connectivity between pgACC and S1L."

METHOD: Using a purposive sampling method, 32 male students diagnosed with ADHD were selected and then randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group received the treatment (NF + SmartMind) for 30 weekly sessions. Children's performances on a time perception test, a Continuous Performance Test (CPT), and a Wechsler working memory test (WISC) were examined before and after the intervention. RESULTS: A significant difference was observed between the mean scores of the pretest and post-test for the experimental group, implying that NF training improved short-time perception and long-time perception attention in CPT test: omission error component, Correct Response component, and working memory: Visual forward component. However, the treatment did not have a significant effect on the commission error component (CPT), working memory in terms of the visual reverse, auditory reverse, and auditory forward components. CONCLUSION: NF combined with computer cognitive games (CCGs) can improve time perception, attention, and working memory in children with ADHD.",

      "abstract": "Persistent pain is a key symptom in people living with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Infra-slow Neurofeedback (ISF-NF) training is a recent development focusing on modulating cortical slow-wave activity to improve pain outcomes. A parallel, two-armed double-blinded, randomized sham-controlled, feasibility clinical trial aimed to determine the feasibility and safety of a novel electroencephalography-based infraslow fluctuation neurofeedback (EEG ISF-NF) training in people with KOA and determine the variability of clinical outcomes and EEG changes following NF training. Eligible participants attended nine 30-min ISF-NF training sessions involving three cortical regions linked to pain. Feasibility measures were monitored during the trial period. Pain and functional outcomes were measured at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up after 2 weeks. Resting-state EEG was recorded at baseline and immediate post-intervention. Participants were middle-aged (61.7 ± 7.6 years), New Zealand European (90.5%), and mostly females (62%) with an average knee pain duration of 4 ± 3.4 years. The study achieved a retention rate of 91%, with 20/22 participants completing all the sessions. Participants rated high levels of acceptance and \"moderate to high levels of perceived effectiveness of the training.\" No serious adverse events were reported during the trial. Mean difference (95% CI) for clinical pain and function measures are as follows for pain severity [active: 0.89 ± 1.7 (-0.27 to 2.0); sham: 0.98 ± 1.1 (0.22-1.7)], pain interference [active: 0.75 ± 2.3 (-0.82 to 2.3); Sham: 0.89 ± 2.1 (-0.60 to 2.4)], pain unpleasantness [active: 2.6 ± 3.7 (0.17-5.1); sham: 2.8 ± 3 (0.62-5.0)] and physical function [active: 6.2 ± 13 (-2.6 to 15); sham: 1.6 ± 12 (-6.8 to 10)]. EEG sources demonstrated frequency-specific neuronal activity, functional connectivity, and ISF ratio changes following NF training. The findings of the study indicated that the ISF-NF training is a feasible, safe, and acceptable intervention for pain management in people with KOA, with high levels of perceived effectiveness. The study also reports the variability in clinical, brain activity, and connectivity changes following training."

      "abstract": "Phantom limb pain is attributed to abnormal sensorimotor cortical representations, although the causal relationship between phantom limb pain and sensorimotor cortical representations suffers from the potentially confounding effects of phantom hand movements. We developed neurofeedback training to change sensorimotor cortical representations without explicit phantom hand movements or hand-like visual feedback. We tested the feasibility of neurofeedback training in fourteen patients with phantom limb pain. Neurofeedback training was performed in a single-blind, randomized, crossover trial using two decoders constructed using motor cortical currents measured during phantom hand movements; the motor cortical currents contralateral or ipsilateral to the phantom hand (contralateral and ipsilateral training) were estimated from magnetoencephalograms. Patients were instructed to control the size of a disk, which was proportional to the decoding results, but to not move their phantom hands or other body parts. The pain assessed by the visual analogue scale was significantly greater after contralateral training than after ipsilateral training. Classification accuracy of phantom hand movements significantly increased only after contralateral training. These results suggested that the proposed neurofeedback training changed phantom hand representation and modulated pain without explicit phantom hand movements or hand-like visual feedback, thus showing the relation between the phantom hand representations and pain. PERSPECTIVE: Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using neurofeedback training to change phantom hand representation and modulate pain perception without explicit phantom hand movements and hand-like visual feedback. The results enhance the mechanistic understanding of certain treatments, such as mirror therapy, that change the sensorimotor cortical representation.",

      "abstract": "Attention is a particularly important indicator in life, as inattention can lead to many negative consequences. As a non-invasive intervention, real-time neurofeedback training can effectively enhance individuals' attention adjustment abilities. However, previous studies have neglected to consider differences among individuals. In this study, an individualized neurofeedback training (INT) method based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was proposed for attention improvement and compared with non-individualized neurofeedback training (NINT). The neurofeedback channels and thresholds were determined individually for each subject. Then, participants conducted four runs of neurofeedback training. Two attention tests (i.e., AX version of continuous performance task (AX-CPT) and attention network test (ANT)) were used to assess the performance of the neurofeedback training. The length of time that the two groups of participants continuously kept their oxygenated hemoglobin concentration above a threshold showed an increasing trend, and the improvement rate of the INT group was higher than that of the NINT group. The reaction times for both groups showed a downward trend, but the INT group declined more significantly. In the fNIRS data, it was observed that the activation degree of the INT group in the middle and dorsolateral prefrontal areas was higher than that of the NINT group. It is preliminarily proved that the proposed INT method can effectively improve the attention level, and its overall performance is better than that of the NINT method."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic insomnia disorder (CID) is a highly prevalent sleep disorder, which influences people's daily life and is even life threatening. However, whether the resting-state regional homogeneity (ReHo) of disrupted brain regions in CID can be reshaped to normal after treatment remains unclear. METHODS: A novel intervention real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF) was used to train 28 CID patients to regulate the activity of the left amygdala for three sessions in 6 weeks. The ReHo methodology was adopted to explore its role on resting-state fMRI data, which were collected before and after training. Moreover, the relationships between changes of clinical variables and ReHo value of altered regions were determined. RESULTS: Results showed that the bilateral dorsal medial pre-frontal cortex, supplementary motor area (SMA), and left dorsal lateral pre-frontal cortex had decreased ReHo values, whereas the bilateral cerebellum anterior lobe (CAL) had increased ReHo values after training. Some clinical scores markedly decreased, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index, Beck Depression Inventory, and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). Additionally, the ReHo values of the left CAL were positively correlated with the change in the Hamilton depression scale score, and a remarkable positive correlation was found between the ReHo values of the right SMA and the HAMA score. CONCLUSION: Our study provided an objective evidence that amygdala-based rtfMRI-NF training could reshape abnormal ReHo and improve sleep in patients with CID. The improved ReHo in CID provides insights into the neurobiological mechanism for the effectiveness of this intervention. However, larger double-blinded sham-controlled trials are needed to confirm our results from this initial study."

      "abstract": "Research on sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) based on neurofeedback (NFb) emphasizes improvements in selective attention associated with SMR amplification. However, the long-term training proposed in most studies posed the question of acceptability, which led to the evaluation of the potential of a single NFb session. Based on cognitive and autonomic controls interfering with attention processes, we hypothesized changes in selective attention after a single SMR-NFb session, along with changes in brain-heart interplay, which are reflected in the multifractality of heartbeat dynamics. Here, young healthy participants (n = 35, 20 females, 21 ± 3 years) were randomly assigned either to a control group (Ctrl) watching a movie or to a neurofeedback (NFb) group performing a single session of SMR-NFb. A headset with EEG electrodes (positioned on C3 and C4) connected to a smartphone app served to guide and to evaluate NFb training efficacy. A Stroop task was performed for 8 min by each group before and after the intervention (movie vs. SMR-NFb) while collecting heart rate variability and C4-EEG for 20 min. When compared to Ctrl, the NFb group exhibited better Stroop performance, especially when facing incongruent trials. The multifractality and NFb training efficacy were identified as strong predictors of the gain in global Stroop performance, while multifractality was the only predictor regarding incongruent trials. We conclude that a single session of SMR-NFb improves selective attention in healthy individuals through the specific reorganization of brain-heart interplay, which is reflected in multifractal heartbeat dynamics."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders of childhood. Treatment of ADHD includes medications and Behavioural interventions. Neurofeedback, a type of biofeedback, has been found to be useful in ADHD. It helps patients to control their brain waves consciously. However, it is not yet conclusive if it is efficacious in comparison to behavioural management training and medication. AIM: To compare the efficacy of neurofeedback training, behaviour management including attention enhancement training and medication in children with ADHD. METHOD: Ninety children between 6 and 12 years with ADHD were taken and randomly divided into 3 treatment groups equally- neurofeedback, behaviour management and medication (methylphenidate). Conners 3-P Short Scale was applied for baseline assessment. The respective interventions were given and follow up was done at the end of 3 months by using Conners 3-P Short scale to assess the improvement in the symptoms. There were 6 dropouts, the final sample size was 84. RESULTS: The medication group showed the greatest reduction of symptoms in inattention, hyperactivity, executive functioning domain (core symptoms of ADHD). No statistically significant difference was observed between Neurofeedback and Behaviour Management in these domains. Learning problems improved in all three groups, neurofeedback being the most effective followed by medication. Both Neurofeedback and Medication groups showed similar effect which was higher than the Behavioural Management group in Peer Relation. CONCLUSION: Improvement in core ADHD symptoms have been observed with all 3 interventions with medication showing the greatest improvement Neurofeedback has been superior for learning problems. Thus, Neurofeedback can be an independent or combined intervention tool for children with ADHD in outpatient department of Psychiatry.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The contingent negative variation (CNV) is a well-studied indicator of attention- and expectancy-related processes in the human brain. An abnormal CNV amplitude has been found in diverse neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders. However, its role as a potential biomarker of successful clinical interventions in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains unclear. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, we investigated how the CNV changes following an intensive neurofeedback training. Therefore, twenty-one adolescents with ASD underwent 24 sessions of slow cortical potential (SCP) neurofeedback training. Twenty additional adolescents with ASD formed a control group and received treatment as usual. CNV waveforms were obtained from a continuous performance test (CPT), which all adolescents performed before and after the corresponding 3-month long training period. In order to utilize all available neural time series, trial-based area under the curve values for all four electroencephalogram (EEG) channels were analyzed with a hierarchical Bayesian model. In addition, the model included impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity as potential moderators of change in CNV. RESULTS: Our model implies that impulsivity moderates the effects of neurofeedback training on CNV depending on group. In the control group, the average CNV amplitude decreased or did not change after treatment as usual. In the experimental group, the CNV changed depending on the severity of comorbid impulsivity symptoms. The average CNV amplitude of participants with low impulsivity scores decreased markedly, whereas the average CNV amplitude of participants with high impulsivity increased. CONCLUSION: The degree of impulsivity seems to play a crucial role in the changeability of the CNV following an intensive neurofeedback training. Therefore, comorbid symptomatology should be recorded and analyzed in future EEG-based brain training interventions. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://www.drks.de, identifier DRKS00012339."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic insomnia disorder (CID) is considered a major public health problem worldwide. Therefore, innovative and effective technical methods for studying the pathogenesis and clinical comprehensive treatment of CID are urgently needed. METHODS: Real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF), a new intervention, was used to train 28 patients with CID to regulate their amygdala activity for three sessions in 6 weeks. Resting-state fMRI data were collected before and after training. Then, voxel-based degree centrality (DC) method was used to explore the effect of rtfMRI-NF training. For regions with altered DC, we determined the specific connections to other regions that most strongly contributed to altered functional networks based on DC. Furthermore, the relationships between the DC value of the altered regions and changes in clinical variables were determined. RESULTS: Patients with CID showed increased DC in the right postcentral gyrus, Rolandic operculum, insula, and superior parietal gyrus and decreased DC in the right supramarginal gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus, angular gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus. Seed-based functional connectivity analyses based on the altered DC regions showed more details about the altered functional networks. Clinical scores in Pittsburgh sleep quality index, insomnia severity index (ISI), Beck depression inventory, and Hamilton anxiety scale decreased. Furthermore, a remarkable positive correlation was found between the changed ISI score and DC values of the right insula. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that amygdala-based rtfMRI-NF training altered the intrinsic functional hubs, which reshaped the abnormal functional connections caused by insomnia and improved the sleep of patients with CID. These findings contribute to our understanding of the neurobiological mechanism of rtfMRI-NF in insomnia treatment. However, additional double-blinded controlled clinical trials with larger sample sizes need to be conducted to confirm the effect of rtfMRI-NF from this initial study."

Neurofeedback (NF) training has been suggested as a promising treatment in these children. This study aimed to investigate the effect of NF training on aggression and impulsivity in schoolchildren with ADHD. METHODS: A total of 40 male elementary school children with ADHD (aged 11.17±0.97 years) were randomized into the NF and sham groups. The NF group received 12 NF training sessions, each taking about 60 minutes for six consecutive weeks (twice a week), based on the Hammond protocol. The subjects' parents were questioned to evaluate the outcomes, including aggression and impulsivity, using the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS). RESULTS: After the intervention, in the NF group, the BPAQ score changed from 87.60±9.33 to 81±7.23 and the BIS score from 94.7±7.25 to 88.05±5.4, which were significant (P=0.001). The results indicated the large effect size of NF on aggression and impulsivity in ADHD. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest NF training as a clinically applicable method for decreasing aggression and impulsivity, also support concurrent use of medication and NF training in children with ADHD."

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of GABA activity strengthening via NFT on subsequent motor learning. Thirty-six healthy participants were randomly assigned to either an NFT group or control group, which received sham feedback. GABA activity was assessed for short intracortical inhibition (SICI) within the right M1 using paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. During the NFT intervention period, the participants tried to modulate the size of a circle, which was altered according to the degree of SICI in the NFT group. However, the size was altered independently of the degree of SICI in the control group. We measured the reaction time before, after (online learning), and 24 h after (offline learning) the finger-tapping task. Results showed the strengthening of GABA activity induced by the NFT intervention, and the suppression of the online but not the offline learning. These findings suggest that prior GABA activity modulation may affect online motor learning.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In healthy older adults, excess theta activity is an electroencephalographic (EEG) predictor of cognitive impairment. In a previous study, neurofeedback (NFB) treatment reinforcing reductions theta activity resulted in EEG reorganization and cognitive improvement. OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical applicability of this NFB treatment, the present study performed a 1-year follow-up to determine its lasting effects. METHODS: Twenty seniors with excessive theta activity in their EEG were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group. The experimental group received an auditory reward when the theta absolute power (AP) was reduced. The control group received the reward randomly. RESULTS: Both groups showed a significant decrease in theta activity at the training electrode. However, the EEG results showed that only the experimental group underwent global changes after treatment. These changes consisted of delta and theta decreases and beta increases. Although no changes were found in any group during the period between the posttreatment evaluation and follow-up, more pronounced theta decreases and beta increases were observed in the experimental group when the follow-up and pretreatment measures were compared. Executive functions showed a tendency to improve two months after treatment which became significant one year later. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the EEG and behavioral benefits of this NFB treatment persist for at least one year, which adds up to the available evidence contributing to identifying factors that increase its efficacy level. The relevance of this study lies in its prophylactic features of addressing a clinically healthy population with EEG risk of cognitive decline.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aims to compare the effects of neurofeedback training on male and female adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Furthermore, it examines sex differences regarding improvements in co-occurring psychopathological symptoms, cognitive flexibility and emotion recognition abilities. The study might provide first hints whether there is an influence of sex on treatment outcomes. METHODS: Six female and six male adolescents with ASD were matched according to age, IQ and symptom severity. All participants received 24 sessions of electroencephalography-based neurofeedback training. Before and after the intervention, psychological data for measuring co-occurring psychopathological symptoms as well as behavioral data for measuring cognitive flexibility and emotion recognition abilities were recorded. RESULTS: Caregivers rated statistically significant higher psychopathological problems in female than in male adolescents with ASD at baseline. Apart from that, no statistically significant sex-related differences were revealed in this sample; however, male adolescents tended to report greater improvements of externalizing, internalizing and total symptoms, whereas females experienced smaller improvements of externalizing and total problems, but no improvements of internalizing problems. Regarding caregivers' assessments, more improvement of total problems was reported for females. For males, only improvements of internalizing and total problems were described. CONCLUSION: This study reveals preliminary results that sex-related differences might play a role when evaluating treatment outcomes after neurofeedback training regarding comorbid psychopathological symptoms. Adolescents' self-report and parental assessments, especially concerning psychopathological symptoms, should be combined and considered in future studies to help prevent sex bias in adolescents with ASD.",

The prediction of individual NF aptitudes is critical in clinical applications to screen patients suitable for NF treatment. In the present study, we extracted the resting-state functional brain connectivity (FC) markers of NF aptitude, independent of NF-targeting brain regions. We combined the data from fMRI-NF studies targeting four different brain regions at two independent sites (obtained from 59 healthy adults and six patients with major depressive disorder) to collect resting-state fMRI data associated with aptitude scores in subsequent fMRI-NF training. We then trained the multiple regression models to predict the individual NF aptitude scores from the resting-state fMRI data using a discovery dataset from one site and identified six resting-state FCs that predicted NF aptitude. Subsequently, the reproducibility of the prediction model was validated using independent test data from another site. The identified FC model revealed that the posterior cingulate cortex was the functional hub among the brain regions and formed predictive resting-state FCs, suggesting that NF aptitude may be involved in the attentional mode-orientation modulation system's characteristics in task-free resting-state brain activity.",

This study investigates the application of real-time functional MRI (rtfMRI) neurofeedback (NF) to foster resistance towards craving-related neural activation in alcohol dependence. We report a double-blind, placebo-controlled rtfMRI study with three NF sessions using alcohol-associated cues as an add-on therapy to the standard treatment. Fifty-two patients (45 male; 7 female) diagnosed with alcohol dependence were recruited in Munich, Germany. RtfMRI data were acquired in three sessions and clinical abstinence was evaluated 3 months after the last NF session. Before the NF training, BOLD responses and clinical data did not differ between groups, apart from anger and impulsiveness. During NF training, BOLD responses of the active group were decreased in medial frontal areas/caudate nucleus, and increased, e.g. in the cuneus/precuneus and occipital cortex. Within the active group, the down-regulation of neuronal responses was more pronounced in patients who remained abstinent for at least 3 months after the intervention compared to patients with a relapse. As BOLD responses were comparable between groups before the NF training, functional variations during NF cannot be attributed to preexisting distinctions. We could not demonstrate that rtfMRI as an add-on treatment in patients with alcohol dependence leads to clinically superior abstinence for the active NF group after 3 months. However, the study provides evidence for a targeted modulation of addiction-associated brain responses in alcohol dependence using rtfMRI.",

      "abstract": "In the past 20 years, neural engineering has made unprecedented progress in the interpretation of brain information (e.g., brain-computer interfaces) and in neuromodulation (e.g., electromagnetic stimulation and neurofeedback). However, there has been little research aiming to improve the performance of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) using neuromodulation. The present study presents a novel design for a neurofeedback training (NFT) method to improve the operation of a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI and further explores its underlying mechanisms. The use of NFT to upregulate alpha-band power in the user's parietal lobe is presented in this study as a new neuromodulation method to improve SSVEP-based BCI in this study. After users completed this NFT intervention, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), accuracy, and information transfer rate (ITR) of the SSVEP-based BCI were increased by 5.8%, 4.7%, and 15.6%, respectively. However, no improvement was observed in the control group in which the subjects did not participate in NFT. Moreover, a general reinforcement of the information flow from the parietal lobe to the occipital lobe was observed. Evidence from a network analysis and an attention test further indicates that NFT improves attention by developing the control capacity of the parietal lobe and then enhances the above SSVEP indicators. Upregulating the amplitude of parietal alpha oscillations using NFT significantly improves the SSVEP-based BCI performance by modulating the control network. The study validates an effective neuromodulation method and possibly contributes to explaining the function of the parietal lobe in the control network.",

Accordingly, utilizing EEG-TBR as a biomarker to diagnose ADHD has been called into question. Besides, employing known protocol to reduce EEG-TBR in the vertex (Cz) channel to treat ADHD via neurofeedback (NFB) has been doubted. The present study was to propose a new NFB treatment protocol to manage ADHD using EEG signals from 30 healthy controls and 30 children with ADHD through an attention-based task and to calculate relative power in their different frequency bands. Then, the most significant distinguishing features of EEG signals from both groups were determined via a genetic algorithm (GA). The results revealed that EEG-TBR values in children with ADHD were lower compared with those in healthy peers; however, such a difference was not statistically significant. Likewise, inhibiting alpha band activity and enhancing delta one in F7 or T5 channels was proposed as a new NFB treatment protocol for ADHD. No significant increase in EEG-TBR in the Cz channel among children with ADHD casts doubt on the effectiveness of using EEG-TBR inhibitory protocols in the Cz channel. Consequently, it was proposed to apply the new protocol along with reinforced beta-band activity to treat or reduce ADHD symptoms.",

      "abstract": "The brain activity that is measured by electroencephalography (EEG) can be modified through operant conditioning, specifically using neurofeedback (NF). NF has been applied to several disorders claiming that a change in the erratic brain activity would be accompanied by a reduction of the symptoms. However, the expected results are not always achieved. Some authors have suggested that the lack of an adequate response may be due to an incorrect application of the operant conditioning principles. A key factor in operant conditioning is the use of reinforcers and their value in modifying behavior, something that is not always sufficiently taken into account. This work aims to clarify the relevance of the motivational value versus the purely informational value of the reinforcer. In this study, 113 subjects were randomly assigned two different reinforcer conditions: a selected reinforcer-the subjects subjectively selected the reinforcers-or an imposed reinforcer-the reinforcers were assigned by the experimenter-and both groups undertook NF sessions to enhance the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR). In addition, the selected reinforcer group was divided into two subgroups: one receiving real NF and the other one sham NF. There were no significant differences between the groups at baseline in terms of SMR amplitude. After the intervention, only those subjects belonging to the selected reinforcer group and receiving real NF increased their SMR. Our results provide evidence for the importance of the motivational value of the reinforcer in Neurofeedback success."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Alpha-neurofeedback (α-NFB) is a novel therapy which trains individuals to volitionally increase their alpha power to improve pain. Learning during NFB is commonly measured using static parameters such as mean alpha power. Considering the biphasic nature of alpha rhythm (high and low alpha), dynamic parameters describing the time spent by individuals in high alpha state and the pattern of transitioning between states might be more useful. Here, we quantify the changes during α-NFB for chronic pain in terms of dynamic changes in alpha states. METHODS: Four chronic pain and four healthy participants received five NFB sessions designed to increase frontal alpha power. Changes in pain resilience were measured using visual analogue scale (VAS) during repeated cold-pressor tests (CPT). Changes in alpha state static and dynamic parameters such as fractional occupancy (time in high alpha state), dwell time (length of high alpha state) and transition probability (probability of moving from low to high alpha state) were analyzed using Friedman's Test and correlated with changes in pain scores using Pearson's correlation. RESULTS: There was no significant change in mean frontal alpha power during NFB. There was a trend of an increase in fractional occupancy, mean dwell duration and transition probability of high alpha state over the five sessions in chronic pain patients only. Significant correlations were observed between change in pain scores and fractional occupancy (r = -0.45, p = 0.03), mean dwell time (r = -0.48, p = 0.04) and transition probability from a low to high state (r = -0.47, p = 0.03) in chronic pain patients but not in healthy participants. CONCLUSION: There is a differential effect between patients and healthy participants in terms of correlation between change in pain scores and alpha state parameters. Parameters providing a more precise description of the alpha power dynamics than the mean may help understand the therapeutic effect of neurofeedback on chronic pain."

Neurofeedback training (NFT) based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtf-MRI) has emerged as an attractive candidate for add-on treatments in psychiatry, but its use in alcohol dependence has not been formally investigated in a clinical trial. We investigated the use of rtfMRI-based NFT to prevent relapse in alcohol dependence. METHODS: Fifty-two alcohol-dependent patients from the UK who had completed a detoxification program were randomly assigned to a treatment group (receiving rtfMRI NFT in addition to standard care) or the control group (receiving standard care only). At baseline, alcohol consumption was assessed as the primary outcome measure and a variety of psychological, behavioral, and neural parameters as secondary outcome measures to determine feasibility and secondary training effects. Participants in the treatment group underwent 6 NFT sessions over 4 months and were trained to downregulate their brain activation in the salience network in the presence of alcohol stimuli and to upregulate frontal activation in response to pictures related to positive goals. Four, 8, and 12 months after baseline assessment, both groups were followed up with a battery of clinical and psychometric tests. RESULTS: Primary outcome measures showed very low relapse rates for both groups. Analysis of neural secondary outcome measures indicated that the majority of patients modulated the salience system in the desired directions, by decreasing activity in response to alcohol stimuli and increasing activation in response to positive goals. The intervention had a good safety and acceptability profile. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that rtfMRI-neurofeedback targeting hyperactivity of the salience network in response to alcohol cues is feasible in currently abstinent patients with alcohol dependence.",

RECENT FINDINGS: NFB is a promising technique that allows patients to gain control over their AVH by modulating their own speech-related/language-related networks including superior temporal gyrus (STG) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using fMRI, fNIRS and EEG/MEG. A recent limited number of studies showed that while an EEG-based NFB study failed to regulate auditory-evoked potentials and reduce AVH, downregulation of STG hyperactivity and upregulation of ACC activity with fMRI-based NFB appear to alleviate treatment-resistant AVH in schizophrenia patients. A deeper understanding of AVH and development of more effective methodologies are still needed. SUMMARY: Despite recent innovations in antipsychotics, many schizophrenia patients continue to suffer from treatment-resistant AVH and social dysfunctions. Recent studies suggested that real-time NFB shows promise in enabling patients to gain control over AVH by regulating their own speech-related/language-related networks. Although fMRI-NFB is suitable for regulating localized activity, EEG/MEG-NFB are ideal for regulating the ever-changing AVH. Although there are still many challenges including logistic complexity and burden on patients, we hope that such innovative real-time NFB trainings will help patients to alleviate severe symptoms and improve social functioning.",

OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to examine the existing literature to confirm the effectiveness of applied electroencephalogram (EEG)-based neurofeedback training in the area of occupational therapy for upper limb stroke rehabilitation. METHOD: All relevant literature published until July 1, 2020 in five prominent databases (PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, MEDLINE Complete, and Web of Science) was reviewed, based on the five-step review framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. RESULTS: After a thorough review, a total of 14 studies were included in this review. Almost studies reported significant improvements as a result of EEG-based neurofeedback training, but this had not always account for the differences in effectiveness between groups. However, the results of these studies suggested that neurofeedback training was effective as compared to the traditional treatment and more effective in combination with EEG than that with simple equipment application. CONCLUSION: This review demonstrated the effectiveness of the combination of occupational therapy and EEG-based neurofeedback training. Most of these treatments are intended for inpatients, but they may be more effective for outpatients, especially if customized to their requirements. Also, such explorations to assess the suitability of the treatment for patient rehabilitation will help reduce barriers to effective interventions. An analysis of the opinions of participants and experts through satisfaction surveys will be helpful.",

The aim of our single-blind, sham-controlled study was to collect rigorous evidence regarding the feasibility of neurofeedback training in Huntington's disease by examining two different methods, activity and connectivity real-time functional MRI neurofeedback training. Thirty-two Huntington's disease gene-carriers completed 16 runs of neurofeedback training, using an optimized real-time functional MRI protocol. Participants were randomized into four groups, two treatment groups, one receiving neurofeedback derived from the activity of the supplementary motor area, and another receiving neurofeedback based on the correlation of supplementary motor area and left striatum activity (connectivity neurofeedback training), and two sham control groups, matched to each of the treatment groups. We examined differences between the groups during neurofeedback training sessions and after training at follow-up sessions. Transfer of training was measured by measuring the participants' ability to upregulate neurofeedback training target levels without feedback (near transfer), as well as by examining change in objective, a priori defined, behavioural measures of cognitive and psychomotor function (far transfer) before and at 2 months after training. We found that the treatment group had significantly higher neurofeedback training target levels during the training sessions compared to the control group. However, we did not find robust evidence of better transfer in the treatment group compared to controls, or a difference between the two neurofeedback training methods. We also did not find evidence in support of a relationship between change in cognitive and psychomotor function and learning success. We conclude that although there is evidence that neurofeedback training can be used to guide participants to regulate the activity and connectivity of specific regions in the brain, evidence regarding transfer of learning and clinical benefit was not robust."

      "abstract": "Typical adolescents have increased limbic engagement unchecked by regulatory medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity as well as heightened self-focus. The resulting emotion dysregulation and self-focused rumination make adolescents more susceptible to depression and suicide attempts. Heightened self-focus converges with mental illness among depressed adolescents, who deploy exaggerated attention to negative self-relevant stimuli and neglect positive ones as part of depression's phenomenology. This results in rigid negative self-representations during an identity formative period with potential lifetime repercussions. Current empirically supported treatments fail to allay recurrent depression. Evidence-based interventions for illnesses linked to suicide ideation and attempts (e.g., depression) underperform across the lifespan. This could be because current treatments are not successful in altering pervasive negative self-representations and affect dysregulation, which is known to be a risk factor of chronic depression. This study departs from the premise that increasing positive self-processing might be protective against chronic depression particularly during adolescence. The present research is a novel investigation of neurofeedback as a potential treatment alternative for adolescent depression. To enhance positive self-processing, we used the happy self-face as a cue to initiate neurofeedback from the bilateral amygdala and hippocampus and adolescents attempted to upregulate that limbic activity through the recall of positive autobiographical memories. We identified limbic functional circuitry engaged during neurofeedback and links to short-term symptoms' change in depression and rumination. We found that depressed youth showed greater right amygdala to right frontocortical connectivity and lower left amygdala to right frontocortical connectivity compared to healthy controls during neurofeedback vs. control conditions. Depressed youth also showed significant symptom reduction. Connectivity between the right amygdala and frontocortical regions was positively correlated with rumination and depression change, but connectivity between frontocortical regions and the left amygdala was negatively correlated with depression change. The results suggest that depressed youth might engage implicit emotion regulation circuitry while healthy youth recruit explicit emotion regulation circuits during neurofeedback. Our findings support a compensatory approach (i.e., target the right amygdala) during future neurofeedback interventions in depressed youth. Future work ought to include a placebo condition or group."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Developmental trauma or chronic early childhood exposure to abuse and neglect by caregivers has been shown to have a long-lasting pervasive impact on mental and neural development, including problems with attention, impulse control, self-regulation, and executive functioning. Its long-term effects are arguably the costliest public health challenge in the United States. Children with developmental trauma rarely have a satisfactory response to currently available evidence-based psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatments. Neurofeedback training (NFT) is a clinical application of brain computer interface technology, aiming to alter electrical brain activity associated with various mental dysfunctions. NFT has shown promise to improve posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. METHOD: This randomized controlled study examined the effects of NFT on 37 children, aged 6-13 years with developmental trauma. Participants were randomly divided into active NFT (n = 20) or treatment-as-usual control (n = 17). Both groups underwent 4 assessments during equivalent timelines. The active group received 24 NFT sessions twice a week. RESULTS: This pilot study demonstrated that 24 sessions of NFT significantly decreased PTSD symptoms, internalizing, externalizing, other behavioral and emotional symptoms, and significantly improved the executive functioning of children aged 6-13 years with severe histories of abuse and neglect who had not significantly benefited from any previous therapy. CONCLUSIONS: NFT offers the possibility to improve learning, enhance self-efficacy, and develop better social relationships in this hitherto largely treatment-resistant population.

      "abstract": "Background: Neurofeedback (NF) training, as a method of self-regulation of brain activity, may be beneficial in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this pilot study, we investigated whether a sensorimotor (SMR)/theta NF training could improve cognitive performance and brain electrical activity in elderly patients with MCI. Methods: Twenty elderly patients with MCI were assigned to 20 consecutive sessions of sensorimotor (SMR)/theta NF training, during 10 weeks, on a basis of two sessions each week. Neuropsychological assessments and questionnaires, as well as electroencephalogram (EEG), were performed and compared between baseline (T0), after the last NF training session at 10 weeks (T1), and 1-month follow-up (T2). Results: Repeated measures ANOVA revealed that from baseline to post-intervention, participants showed significant improvement in the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCa, F = 4.78; p = 0.012), the delayed recall of the Rey auditory verbal learning test (RAVLT, F = 3.675; p = 0.032), the Forward digit span (F = 13.82; p < 0.0001), the Anxiety Goldberg Scale (F = 4.54; p = 0.015), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Score-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV; F = 24.75; p < 0.0001), and the Mac Nair score (F = 4.47; p = 0.016). EEG theta power (F = 4.44; p = 0.016) and alpha power (F = 3.84; p = 0.027) during eyes-closed resting-state significantly increased after the NF training and showed sustained improvement at a 1-month follow-up. Conclusion: Our results suggest that NF training could be effective to reduce cognitive deficits in elderly patients with MCI and improve their EEG activity. If these findings are confirmed by randomized controlled studies with larger samples of patients, NF could be seen as a useful non-invasive, non-pharmacological tool for preventing further decline, rehabilitation of cognitive function in the elderly.

      "abstract": "Neurofeedback (NF), a training tool aimed at enhancing neural self-regulation, has been suggested as a complementary treatment option for neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite its potential as a neurobiological intervention directly targeting neural alterations underlying clinical symptoms, the efficacy of NF for the treatment of mental disorders has been questioned recently by negative findings obtained in randomized controlled trials (e.g., Cortese et al., 2016). A possible reason for insufficient group effects of NF trainings vs. placebo could be related to the high rate of participants who fail to self-regulate brain activity by NF (\"non-learners\"). Another reason could be the application of standardized NF protocols not adjusted to individual differences in pathophysiology. Against this background, we have summarized information on factors determining training and treatment success to provide a basis for the development of individualized training protocols and/or clinical indications. The present systematic review included 25 reports investigating predictors for the outcome of NF trainings in healthy individuals as well as patients affected by mental disorders or epilepsy. We selected these studies based on searches in EBSCOhost using combinations of the keywords \"neurofeedback\" and \"predictor/predictors\". As \"NF training\" we defined all NF applications with at least two sessions. The best available evidence exists for neurophysiological baseline parameters. Among them, the target parameters of the respective training seem to be of particular importance. However, particularities of the different experimental designs and outcome criteria restrict the interpretability of some of the information we extracted. Therefore, further research is needed to gain more profound knowledge about predictors of NF outcome.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tinnitus is a particularly common condition and can have debilitating psychological consequences for certain people. Although several interventions have been helpful in teaching individuals to better cope with tinnitus, no cure exists at present. Neurofeedback is an emerging treatment modality in tinnitus. Previous studies, utilising an alpha/delta training protocol, have shown promise. However, they were characterised by small sample sizes and a lack of neurofeedback control conditions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate whether an alpha/delta neurofeedback training protocol, compared to beta/theta neurofeedback or a diary control group, is effective in reducing not only the tinnitus sound perception but also the psychological symptoms associated with the condition. METHODS: The study is designed as a three-armed randomised controlled trial. Participants are randomly assigned to a) an established neurofeedback protocol for tinnitus (alpha/delta training), b) an active control group (beta/theta training) or c) a diary control group. In the 4-week intervention period, participants in both neurofeedback groups undergo 10 sessions, whereas participants in the diary control group complete a bi-weekly diary. The primary outcomes are between group differences in tinnitus sound perception change, as measured with the Tinnitus Magnitude Index (TMI), and changes in tinnitus distress, measured with the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), 4 weeks after the start of the intervention. Secondary outcome measures include changes in tinnitus distress, sleep quality, depressive symptoms and whether neurofeedback leads to specific power changes in the trained frequency bands. DISCUSSION: This is the first randomised controlled trial examining the efficacy of an alpha/delta neurofeedback training protocol in reducing tinnitus sound perception and the distress associated with the condition. Compared to former studies, the present study is designed to assess both the specificity of an alpha/delta neurofeedback training protocol by including an active comparator and beta/theta neurofeedback training, in addition to controlling for placebo effects by the inclusion of a diary control group. This study aims to contribute to an understanding of the influences of both specific and non-specific effects in neurofeedback treatment for tinnitus.

      "abstract": "Neurofeedback (NFB) is an operant conditioning procedure whereby an individual learns to self-regulate the electrical activity of his/her brain. Initially developed as a treatment intervention for pathologies with underlying EEG dysfunctions, NFB is also used as a training tool to enhance specific cognitive states required in high-performance situations. The original idea behind the NFB training effect is that the changes should only be circumscribed to the trained EEG frequencies. The EEG frequencies which are not used as feedback frequencies should be independent and not affected by the neurofeedback training. Despite the success of sensorimotor rhythm NFB training in cognitive performance enhancement, it remains unclear whether all participants can intentionally modify the power densities of specifically selected electroencephalographic (EEG) frequencies. In the present study, participants were randomly assigned to either a control heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback (HRV) training group or a combination of HRV biofeedback and neurofeedback (HRV/NFB) training group. This randomized mixed design experiment consisted of two introductory theoretical lessons and a training period of 6 weeks. We investigated the evolution of the different EEG frequency bands of our two experimental groups across and within session. All the participants exhibited EEG changes across and within session. However, within the HRV/NFB training group, untrained EEG frequencies have been significantly modified, unlike some of the trained frequencies. Moreover, EEG activity was modified in both the HRV group and the HRV/NFB groups. Hence, the EEG changes were not only circumscribed to the trained frequency bands or to the training modality."

Previous neuroscience research highlighted that NeuroFeedback (NF) training mediated by wearable devices could be effective in terms of neurocognitive strengthening and attention regulation with a direct effect on driving attentional performance. Thus, this research aims to test the effectiveness of a NF protocol on a sample of drivers, to observe its impact on attentional skills and psychophysiological levels of stress involved in driving behavior. 50 participants were randomly assigned to the experimental and active control group. The experimental condition consisted of a 21-day mindfulness NF training with incremental duration sessions. A pre- (t0) and post-treatment (t1) assessment included behavioral, psychometric, neuropsychological, and psychophysiological autonomic measures. Specifically, the Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ) and the Active Box (AB) device were used to evaluate the everyday driving behavior. Results underlined an improvement in driving behavior performance and a decrease of violations at the wheel of the experimental group (EXPg) at t1 measured, respectively by AB and DBQ. About the autonomic and neuropsychological measure, an increase in heart rate (HR) and an increased accuracy at the Stroop Task were detected: a specific increase of Stroop-related HR was found for the EXPg at t1. Also, reduced reaction times were found in the Multiple Features Target Cancellation for the EXPg at t1. Overall, the EXPg displayed a physiological, behavioral and neuropsychological increased efficiency related to attention as well as a driving-related behavioral improvement after NF training."

Neurofeedback training may enhance working memory and provide a solution to this problem. Aim. To investigate the effect of frequency-neurofeedback on working memory in children with ADHD and to check if the effect is long-lasting. Method. Forty-eight children with ADHD (aged 6-12 years) were randomly assigned either to a neurofeedback with training parameters chosen to take into account each child's peak alpha frequency (PAF) or to a waiting list control group. Each trained child underwent 19-channel electroencephalography (EEG). All children had average intelligence and none were receiving treatment, such as medications, for ADHD. Prior to the training, MOXO and n-back tests were performed. Next, neurofeedback training sessions with frequency bands for theta and beta ranges determined using each child's PAF were carried out for 10 weeks. Training parameters were set to increase amplitudes in the low beta range and to decrease amplitudes in the theta and high beta frequency ranges. The n-back test was performed again right after the training and then a year later. Results. During the first n-back test, children from both groups responded correctly to more than 43% of the stimuli. During the second test, children from the waiting list responded correctly to an average of 49% of the stimuli, while children who underwent the neurofeedback training were correct, on average, 69% of the time (significant difference, P < .001). During the third n-back test a year later, children from the waiting list responded correctly to 53% of the stimuli, while those who underwent the neurofeedback training responded correctly to nearly 71%. Conclusion. This study found a statistically significant improvement in a measure of working memory in children who did 10 to 12 sessions of neurofeedback training with training frequency ranges for theta and beta defined according to each child's PAF. The beneficial effects were still present a year after training.",

      "abstract": "Stroke is a debilitating neurological condition which usually results in the abnormal electrical brain activity and the impairment of sensation, motor, or cognition functions. In this context, neurofeedback training, i.e., a non-invasive and relatively low cost technique that contributes to neuroplasticity and behavioral performance, might be promising for stroke rehabilitation. We intended to explore neurofeedback training on a 63-year-old male patient and a 77-year-old female patient with chronic stroke. Both of them had suffered from an ischemic stroke for rather long period (more than 3 years) and could not gain further improvement by traditional therapy. The neurofeedback training was designed to enhance alpha activity by 15 sessions distributed over 2 months, for the purpose of overall cognitive improvement and hopefully also motor function improvement for the female patient. We found that the two patients showed alpha enhancement during NFT compared to eyes open baseline within most sessions. Furthermore, both patients reduced their anxiety and depression level. The male patient showed an evolution in speech pattern in terms of naming, sentences completion and verbal fluency, while the female patient improved functionality of the march. These results suggested that alpha neurofeedback training could provide a spectrum of improvements, providing new hope for chronic stroke patients who could not gain further improvements through traditional therapies."

Although the benefits of exercise for fall prevention have been demonstrated, the majority of the elderly are physically inactive due to several physical and mental limitations they may face. Another alternative treatment such as neurofeedback with providing additional sensory information may enhance movement performance and so decrease the risk of fall. Objectives: To compare the effects of physical activity and neurofeedback training on postural stability and risk of fall in elderly women. Methods: Forty-five physically independent women who were older than 65 years old, living in the Fereshtegan Elderly Care Center in Shiraz, were recruited and randomly divided into three groups including control, physical activity, and neurofeedback training (15 people in each group). Participants in experimental groups trained for 12 weeks (3 days per week/30 minutes per session). Fall risk and postural stability of participants in all three groups were evaluated before and after intervention using the Biodex Balance System. Results: A mixed model design ANOVA comparing neurofeedback training and physical activity exhibited a significantly greater improvement in both risk of fall and postural stability compared to control (P < .05). Results of post-hoc analysis further indicated that neurofeedback training compared to physical activity can be superior beneficial in reducing risk of fall (P = .005) and improving postural stability (P = .005). There were also significant interactions between group and time of fall risk (P = .0005, ηp2 = 0.97) and postural stability (P = .001, ηp2 = 0.79). Conclusion: Both neurofeedback and physical activity could be considered as useful alternative for postural stability and balance improvement in elderly women; however, neurofeedback training was more effective than physical activity.",

Increasing evidence shows some patients are unable to regulate cortical activity. Before neurofeedback can be applied successfully, research is needed to investigate the interpersonal mechanisms responsible for patients' ability to respond to neurofeedback. A single-case experimental design allows for close monitoring of individual patients, providing valuable information about patients' response to the intervention and the time frame in which changes in clinical symptoms can be observed. Four patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR) substance use disorder and various comorbidities participated in a sham-controlled clinical case study. Self-report level of impulsivity and craving were assessed. Results indicate that one patient showed more improvements on behavioral measures after the neurofeedback training than did the others. This patient reported less impulsivity and reduced levels of self-reported craving. However, these findings could not be attributed to the neurofeedback intervention. The findings suggest that there is insufficient evidence for the beneficial effects of a theta/sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) neurofeedback intervention on measures of impulsivity and craving, and that there may be great interindividual differences in patients' ability to regulate cortical activity.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study examines the clinical efficacy of a game-based neurofeedback training (NFT) system to enhance cognitive performance in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and healthy elderly subjects. The NFT system includes five games designed to improve attention span and cognitive performance. The system estimates attention levels by investigating the power spectrum of Beta and Alpha bands. METHODS: We recruited 65 women with aMCI and 54 healthy elderly women. All participants were treated with care as usual (CAU); 58 were treated with CAU + NFT (20 sessions of 30 minutes each, 2-3 sessions per week), 36 with CAU + exergame-based training, while 25 patients had only CAU. Cognitive functions were assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery both before and after treatment. RESULTS: NFT significantly improved rapid visual processing and spatial working memory (SWM), including strategy, when compared with exergame training and no active treatment. aMCI was characterized by impairments in SWM (including strategy), pattern recognition memory, and delayed matching to samples. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, treatment with NFT improves sustained attention and SWM. Nevertheless, NFT had no significant effect on pattern recognition memory and short-term visual memory, which are the other hallmarks of aMCI. The NFT system used here may selectively improve sustained attention, strategy, and executive functions, but not other cognitive impairments, which characterize aMCI in women.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive deficits including impaired information processing speed as assessed by the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) are common in multiple sclerosis (MS). Oscillatory markers of processing speed may be extracted from magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and electroencephalographic (EEG) resting-state recordings. In this context, an increased proportion of frontal slow-wave (theta, 4-8 Hz) to fast-wave (beta, 13-30 Hz) EEG activity was indicative of impaired SDMT performance. Such an increased theta/beta ratio may reflect oscillatory slowing associated with deficits in attention control. Therapeutic approaches that consider atypical oscillatory activity in MS remain sparse. OBJECTIVES: In a cross-sectional design, we examined the relation between SDMT performance, the EEG theta/beta ratio and its components. We also explored longitudinally, whether EEG neurofeedback could be used to induce a putatively adaptive alteration in these EEG parameters, toward a pattern indicative of improved processing speed. METHODS: N = 58 MS patients (RRMS/SPMS/PPMS N: 18/35/3, 2 cases excluded) participated in a neuropsychological examination and a resting-state EEG recording. Subsequently, N = 10 patients received neurofeedback training for two weeks in a hospitalized setting. The purpose was to reduce the frontal theta/beta ratio through operant conditioning. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional examination, patients with slow SDMT speed displayed an increased theta/beta ratio, relative to those with normal speed. This involved increased frontal theta power, whereas beta power was equal across groups. The theta/beta ratio remained stable during neurofeedback across sessions of the two-week training period. In an exploratory secondary analysis, within sessions a reduction in the theta/beta ratio during active training blocks relative pre/post session resting-states was observed, driven by reduced theta power. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide support for utilizing frontal EEG theta activity as an inverse marker of processing speed in MS. Across sessions, there was no support for successful operant conditioning of the theta/beta ratio during the two-week training period. The observed state-specific shift within sessions, involving a transient reduction in theta activity, nevertheless may provide a rationale for a further investigation of neurofeedback as a treatment approach in MS.",

Previous studies have indicated that successful regulation of the target region led to changes in other brain regions as a network during neurofeedback training. However, it is unclear how neurofeedback training of the amygdala affects the network engaged in facial expression. In this study, we investigated the changes in the amygdala network involved in a facial expression task after rtfMRI training of the left amygdala. The amygdala network of pre- and post-training tasks with pleasant expression as the stimulus was extracted using group independent component analysis. The results showed that not only the activity of the amygdala network but also the functional connectivity of the fusiform with the amygdala within the network was enhanced by training. Moreover, increases in this connectivity were correlated with increases in behavioral performance. These findings suggest the functional significance of the connectivity of the fusiform with the amygdala engaged in facial emotional perception as well as their close correlation with behavior, thus providing new insights into the mechanisms of neurofeedback-based emotional regulation and clinical treatment of related emotional disorders.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are at high risk of progressing to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Slowing down the effect of dementia by enhancing brain plasticity represents one of the most prominent challenges. Neurofeedback (NF) has shown promising results in improving working memory but has never been evaluated in people with MCI. We aim to examine whether NF training can decrease cognitive disorders, targeting memory, attention functions and brain electrical activity in elderly patients with MCI. METHODS: In this single-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) protocol, we will investigate the effects of two NF training protocols on cognitive performances and on brain electrical activity. Sixty MCI patients will be assigned either to an intervention program or to psycho-pedagogical care as a control condition. Participants in the intervention group will attend 30 sessions of sensorimotor/delta-ratio NF training or beta1/theta-ratio NF training. Neuropsychological assessment, questionnaires and electroencephalography (EEG) assessment parameters will be used as dependent variables in three periods: at baseline (T0), immediately after the last NF training session at 4 months (T1) and at 3-month follow-up (T2). The primary outcome will be the change in attention measured with the Trail Making Test B. Secondary outcome will be the changes in cognitive performance and in EEG activities. DISCUSSION: If the results of our study show improvement in cognitive performances of older adults with MCI, this non-invasive, low-cost technique may deserve better consideration as a therapeutic intervention to delay cognitive decline and dementia. Consequently, research in NF will need to review and develop the rigor of its application in gerontology. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT03526692 . Registered on 16 May 2018.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Forensic psychiatric patients are often diagnosed with psychiatric disorders characterized by high levels of impulsivity as well as comorbid substance use disorders (SUD). The combination of psychiatric disorders and SUD increases the risk of future violence. Chronic substance abuse can lead to a structural state of disinhibition, resulting in more drug taking and eventually loss of control over drug intake. When treating SUD, it is crucial to address high levels of impulsivity and lack of inhibitory control. OBJECTIVE: This study set out to investigate the effects of a theta/sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) neurofeedback training protocol on levels of impulsivity, levels of drug craving, and actual drug intake in a population of forensic psychiatric patients with a diagnosis of SUD. METHODS: A total of 21 participants received 20 sessions of theta/SMR neurofeedback training in combination with treatment-as-usual (TAU). Results of the intervention were compared with results from 21 participants who received TAU only. RESULTS: SMR magnitude showed a significant (P=.02) increase post training for patients in the neurofeedback training group, whereas theta magnitude did not change (P=.71). Levels of drug craving as well as scores on the motor subscale of the Barratt Impulsivity Scale-11 decreased equally for patients in the neurofeedback training group and the TAU group. Other measures of impulsivity as well as drug intake did not change posttreatment (P>.05). Therefore, neurofeedback+TAU was not more effective than TAU only. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated evidence that forensic psychiatric patients are able to increase SMR magnitude over the course of neurofeedback training. However, at the group level, the increase in SMR activity was not related to any of the included impulsivity or drug craving measures. Further research should focus on which patients will be able to benefit from neurofeedback training at an early stage of the employed training sessions.

The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) neurofeedback (NF) training-targeting the dlPFC-and its effects on threat-related attention biases of individuals with SAD. 12 individuals with SAD participated in the NIRS-NF training lasting 6-8 weeks and including a total of 15 sessions. NF performance increased significantly, while the attention bias towards threat-related stimuli and SAD symptom severity decreased after the training. The individual increase in neurofeedback performance as well as the individual decrease in SAD symptom severity was correlated with decreased responses to social threat signals in the cerebral attention system. Thus, this pilot study does not only demonstrate that NIRS-based NF is feasible in SAD patients, but also may be a promising method to investigate the causal role of the dlPFC in attention biases in SAD. Its effectiveness as a treatment tool might be examined in future studies.",

EEG neurofeedback training (NFT) is a new intervention modality based on operant conditioning of brain activity, which helps reduce symptoms of ADHD in children. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: To examine the efficacy of NFT in children with ADHD, an experimental longitudinal design with pre-post comparison was adopted. A total of 30 children in the age range of 6 to 12 years diagnosed as ADHD with or without comorbid conditions were assigned to treatment group (TG; n = 15) and treatment as usual group (TAU; n = 15). TG received EEG-NFT along with routine clinical management and TAU received routine clinical management alone. Forty sessions of theta/beta NFT at the C3 scalp location, 3 to 4 sessions in a week for a period of 3.5 to 5 months were given to children in TG. Children were screened using sociodemographic data and Binet-Kamat test of intelligence. Pre-and postassessment tools were neuropsychological tests and behavioral scales. Follow-up was carried out on 8 children in TG using parent-rated behavioral measures. RESULTS: Improvement was reported in TG on cognitive functions (sustained attention, verbal working memory, and response inhibition), parent- and teacher-rated behavior problems and on academic performance rated by teachers. Follow-up of children who received NFT showed sustained improvement in ADHD symptoms when assessed 6 months after receiving NFT. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that NFT is an effective method to enhance cognitive deficits and helps reduce ADHD symptoms and behavior problems. Consequently, academic performance was found to be improved in children with ADHD. Improvement in ADHD symptoms induced by NFT were maintained at 6-month follow-up in children with ADHD.",

      "abstract": "Neurofeedback has long been proposed as a promising form of adjunctive non-pharmaceutical treatment for a variety of neuropsychological disorders. However, there is much debate over its efficacy and specificity. Many suggest that specificity can only be achieved when a specially trained clinician manually updates reward thresholds that indicate to the trainee when they are modulating their brain activity correctly, during training. We present a novel fully automated reward thresholding algorithm called progressive thresholding and test it with a frontal alpha asymmetry neurofeedback protocol. Progressive thresholding uses dynamic difficulty tuning and individual-specific progress models to simulate the shaping a clinician might perform when setting reward thresholds manually. We demonstrate in a double-blind comparison that progressive thresholding leads to significantly better learning outcomes compared with current automatic reward thresholding algorithms.",

Therefore, the purpose of this study is the comparison of neurofeedback with Ritalin and without Ritalin in treating children with ADHD. This study was causal-comparative in design. Participants were children aged 5-10 years with ADHD; seven participants were in neurofeedback group with Ritalin and seven in neurofeedback without Ritalin group according to random split and parent's conformation. Clinical Q, Conner's continuous performance test (CPT), and WISC-R were used before and after treatment. For analyzing data, we used descriptive statistical and Mann Whitney U tests. Results showed that even if the two groups were modified in all components, modifications of commission and reaction time of the CPT and F4 theta/alpha of the clinical Q were more accurate in NF with Ritalin treatment rather than the other group. These findings suggest that neurofeedback is efficient in improving some of the behavioral concomitants of ADHD in children whose parents favored non-pharmacological treatment, but Ritalin and neurofeedback combination is more efficient. So, multimodal approach is strongly recommended for ADHD treatment.",

      "abstract": "It is generally accepted that children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have poor motor control, especially in bimanual coordination tasks. Such children characteristically have impaired fine motor ability, problems with force control, and poor motor coordination. They are at particular risk of loss of motor control and reduced bimanual coordination. We tested whether, compared to a control condition, neurofeedback training (NFT) could improve bimanual coordination among children with ADHD. 20 Children with ADHD (mean age 7.9 years; SD 2.11) were randomly assigned either to NFT or to a control condition. All participants completed a bimanual coordination test at the following time points: baseline, assessment 1, assessment 2, assessment 3, and again 12 session later at posttest. NFT consisted of Sensory Motor Rhythm (SMR) training to achieve increased SMR in C3 and C4, while participants in the control condition were under mock NFT conditions. Bimanual coordination accuracy and consistency improved from baseline to completion of the intervention (significant Time effect), but in the NFT condition (significant time × group interaction). Compared to the control condition, the NFT group had fewer errors in both patterns of bimanual coordination (significant Group effect). Among children with ADHD, SMR neurofeedback training (NFT) led to significant improvements in a bimanual coordination task. The SMR NFT thus appears to have the potential to improve and enhance the motor control of ADHD patients.",

METHODS: A nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design was used. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires from 36 Korean inpatients who met the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test in Korea criteria. Data were collected from quantitative electroencephalography to assess alpha (8-12 Hz) and high-beta (21-30 Hz) waves for hyperarousal. The questionnaires included Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction scales that assessed autonomy, competence, and relatedness, and the Alcohol Abstinence Self-Efficacy Scale and Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire. The experimental group underwent 10 sessions of neurofeedback training over four weeks. Data were analyzed using the chi-squared, Mann-Whitney U, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. RESULTS: In the experimental group, the alpha wave was increased in 15 of 19 sites and high-beta waves were decreased in 15 of 19 sites, but this difference was not significant. However, high-beta waves were increased in 15 of 19 sites in the control group, with seven sites (Fz, Cz, Pz, Fp2, F4, C4, and P4) showing significant increases. The experimental group showed a significant increase in basic psychological need satisfaction, alcohol abstinence self-efficacy, and self-regulation compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Neurofeedback training is recommended for improving autonomous regulation in alcohol use disorder as a nursing intervention. However, for significantly attenuating hyperarousal through brain wave correction, it may be necessary to increase the number of neurofeedback sessions."

METHODS: A nonequivalent control group pre-post quasi-experimental design was used. Participants were 78 late adolescents assigned to the experimental group (n=39) that received the neurofeedback training and the control group (n=39). Data were collected on heart rate variability (HRV) and skin conductance level (SCL) to assess stress-biomarker response. The questionnaire contained 164 items from: Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) and Self-regulatory Ability scale. The neurofeedback training was based on the general adaptation syndrome and body-mind medicine. The intervention was conducted in a total of 10 sessions for 30 minutes per session with high-beta, theta and sensory motor rhythm training on scalp at central zero. RESULTS: There were significant difference in standard deviation of normal to normal interval (p=.036) in HRV and SCL (p=.029) of stress-biomarker response between the two groups. Negative affect (p=.036) in PANAS and obsessive compulsive (p=.023) and depression (p<.001) in SCL-90-R were statistically significant. Self-regulation mode (p=.004) in self-regulation ability scale showed a significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the neurofeedback training is effective in stress-biomarkers, psychoemotional stress response and self-regulation. Therefore, neurofeedback training using neuroscientific approach based on brain-mind-body model can be used as an effective nursing intervention for late adolescents in clinics and communities for effective stress responses.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Effective treatment interventions for criminal offenders are necessary to reduce risk of criminal recidivism. Evidence about deviant electroencephalographic (EEG)-frequencies underlying disorders found in criminal offenders is accumulating. Yet, treatment modalities, such as neurofeedback, are rarely applied in the forensic psychiatric domain. Since offenders usually have multiple disorders, difficulties adhering to long-term treatment modalities, and are highly vulnerable for psychiatric decompensation, more information about neurofeedback training protocols, number of sessions, and expected symptom reduction is necessary before it can be successfully used in offender populations. METHOD: Studies were analyzed that used neurofeedback in adult criminal offenders, and in disorders these patients present with. Specifically aggression, violence, recidivism, offending, psychopathy, schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), substance-use disorder (SUD), and cluster B personality disorders were included. Only studies that reported changes in EEG-frequencies posttreatment (increase/decrease/no change in EEG amplitude/power) were included. RESULTS: Databases Psychinfo and Pubmed were searched in the period 1990-2017 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, resulting in a total of 10 studies. Studies in which neurofeedback was applied in ADHD (N = 3), SUD (N = 3), schizophrenia (N = 3), and psychopathy (N = 1) could be identified. No studies could be identified for neurofeedback applied in cluster B personality disorders, aggression, violence, or recidivism in criminal offenders. For all treatment populations and neurofeedback protocols, number of sessions varied greatly. Changes in behavioral levels ranged from no improvements to significant symptom reduction after neurofeedback training. The results are also mixed concerning posttreatment changes in targeted EEG-frequency bands. Only three studies established criteria for EEG-learning. CONCLUSION: Implications of the results for the applicability of neurofeedback training in criminal offender populations are discussed. More research focusing on neurofeedback and learning of cortical activity regulation is needed in populations with externalizing behaviors associated with violence and criminal behavior, as well as multiple comorbidities. At this point, it is unclear whether standard neurofeedback training protocols can be applied in offender populations, or whether QEEG-guided neurofeedback is a better choice. Given the special context in which the studies are executed, clinical trials, as well as single-case experimental designs, might be more feasible than large double-blind randomized controls."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: It has been found that reduction of posttraumatic stress symptoms is positively associated with the reduction of postconcussive symptoms. Cortisol is commonly used as a biomarker of stress. Understanding the role of posttraumatic stress and cortisol in symptom reduction has implication for neuropsychological rehabilitation particularly in the context of spontaneous recovery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the research was to study the effectiveness of EEG neurofeedback training on clinical symptoms, perceived stress, and cortisol in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients in the context of spontaneous recovery. METHODS: The design was an experimental longitudinal design with the pre-post comparison. The sample comprised 60 patients with the diagnosis of TBI-30 patients in the neurofeedback training (NFT) group and 30 patients in the treatment as usual group (TAU) group. Half of the patients were recruited within 6 months of injury to study the role of spontaneous recovery and the other half were recruited in the 12 to 18 months postinjury phase. Alpha-theta training was given to the NFT group over 20 sessions. Pre and post comparisons were made on clinical symptom rating, perceived stress, and serum cortisol levels. RESULTS: The results indicate significant differences in symptom reporting and perceived stress between the NFT and TAU groups. Significant differences were also seen in cortisol levels with implications for the acute recovery phase. CONCLUSION: Alpha-theta NFT has a beneficial effect on symptom reduction as well as perceived stress. It also has a beneficial effect on levels of serum cortisol, corroborating these findings.",

      "abstract": "Neurologic disorders are characterized by abnormal cellular-, molecular-, and circuit-level functions in the brain. New methods to induce and control neuroplastic processes and correct abnormal function, or even shift functions from damaged tissue to physiologically healthy brain regions, hold the potential to dramatically improve overall health. Of the current neuroplastic interventions in development, neurofeedback training (NFT) from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has the advantages of being completely non-invasive, non-pharmacologic, and spatially localized to target brain regions, as well as having no known side effects. Furthermore, NFT techniques, initially developed using fMRI, can often be translated to exercises that can be performed outside of the scanner without the aid of medical professionals or sophisticated medical equipment. In fMRI NFT, the fMRI signal is measured from specific regions of the brain, processed, and presented to the participant in real-time. Through training, self-directed mental processing techniques, that regulate this signal and its underlying neurophysiologic correlates, are developed. FMRI NFT has been used to train volitional control over a wide range of brain regions with implications for several different cognitive, behavioral, and motor systems. Additionally, fMRI NFT has shown promise in a broad range of applications such as the treatment of neurologic disorders and the augmentation of baseline human performance. In this article, we present an fMRI NFT protocol developed at our institution for modulation of both healthy and abnormal brain function, as well as examples of using the method to target both cognitive and auditory regions of the brain.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline is characteristic for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and also for healthy ageing. As a proof-of-concept study, we examined whether this decline can be counteracted using real-time fMRI neurofeedback training. Visuospatial memory and the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) were targeted. METHODS: Sixteen healthy elderly subjects (mean age 63.5 years, SD = 6.663) and 10 patients with prodromal AD (mean age 66.2 years, SD = 8.930) completed the experiment. Four additional healthy subjects formed a sham-feedback condition to validate the paradigm. The protocol spanned five examination days (T1-T5). T1 contained a neuropsychological pre-test, the encoding of a real-world footpath, and an anatomical MRI scan of the brain. T2-T4 included the fMRI neurofeedback training paradigm, in which subjects learned to enhance activation of the left PHG while recalling the path encoded on T1. At T5, the neuropsychological post-test and another anatomical MRI brain scan were performed. The neuropsychological battery included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); the Visual and Verbal Memory Test (VVM); subtests of the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS); the Visual Patterns Test; and Trail Making Tests (TMT) A and B. RESULTS: Healthy elderly and patients with prodromal AD showed improved visuospatial memory performance after neurofeedback training. Healthy subjects also performed better in a working-memory task (WMS backward digit-span) and in the MoCA. Both groups were able to elicit parahippocampal activation during training, but no significant changes in brain activation were found over the course of the training. However, Granger-causality-analysis revealed changes in cerebral connectivity over the course of the training, involving the parahippocampus and identifying the precuneus as main driver of activation in both groups. Voxel-based morphometry showed increases in grey matter volumes in the precuneus and frontal cortex. Neither cognitive enhancements, nor parahippocampal activation were found in the control group undergoing sham-feedback. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that cognitive decline, either related to prodromal AD or healthy ageing, could be counteracted using fMRI-based neurofeedback. Future research needs to determine the potential of this method as a treatment tool."

However, some of these patients have complex, severe dizziness, meaning that a pharmacological pretreatment or parallel (to vestibular rehabilitation) treatment can help them perform the rehabilitation exercises. Hence, the present study investigated the influence of a pharmacological treatment on the efficacy of vibrotactile neurofeedback training in patients with chronic, noncompensated vestibulopathies. All participants performed IVNT for ∼10 min each day for 2 weeks. In addition, every second participant was selected randomly to receive oral medication (20 mg cinnarizine and 40 mg dimenhydrinate per tablet), taking three tables per day. Trunk and ankle sway and postural stability were measured. In addition, the dizziness handicap inventory was evaluated immediately before training on the last day of training and 6 months after training. After the 10-day period of IVNT, both groups showed a statistically significant improvement in all parameters tested. A follow-up analysis after 6 months showed a long-term efficacy for the IVNT, that is, the patients remained significantly improved in their postural stability. The antivertiginous therapy did not hinder the efficacy of the IVNT. The present results indicate that IVNT even in combination with an antivertiginous drug therapy is an effective treatment regime for patients with disabling vertigo of different origins.",

Neurofeedback training, which enables the individuals to regulate their brain activity using a real-time feedback loop, is increasingly investigated as a potential alternative intervention for schizophrenia. This study aimed to explore the effect of short but intensive neurofeedback training for schizophrenic patients with difficulty for long-time training. A middle-aged woman with chronic schizophrenia completed the intensive training of alpha/beta2 (20-30 Hz) in four consecutive days with a total training duration of 13.5 hours. The results showed that her alpha/beta2 increased over sessions, and her behavior performance including short-term memory, mood, and speech pattern was improved at the end of neurofeedback training. Importantly, a 22-month follow-up found a dramatic improvement in both positive and negative symptoms. These positive outcomes suggest that such intensive neurofeedback training may provide new insight into the treatment of schizophrenia and thus deserves further study to fully examine its scope.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Neurofeedback (NF) training aims the enhancement of self-regulation over brain activities. While it is largely recognized as an effective treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the existence of non-learners has also been reported. The present study explored pre-training assessment indices that could predict learners prior to NF training. METHODS: Twenty-two children with ADHD participated in slow cortical potential (SCP) NF training and completed pre- and post-training assessments. Participants were classified into learners or non-learners based on their progress in the SCP regulation, and pre-training indices that differentiate the two groups were examined by decision tree analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The learner rate in NF training was 45.5%. Learners were predicted by pre-training cognitive and neurophysiological measures regarding Stroop tasks, which suggested relatively intact executive function as their characteristics. Given that NF training is not universally effective for children with ADHD, further studies are necessary to establish application criteria.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterized by poor cognitive control/attention and hypofunctioning of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). In the current study, we investigated for the first time whether real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rt-fMRI) training targeted at increasing activation levels within dACC in adults with ADHD leads to a reduction of clinical symptoms and improved cognitive functioning. An exploratory randomized controlled treatment study with blinding of the participants was conducted. Participants with ADHD (n = 7 in the neurofeedback group, and n = 6 in the control group) attended four weekly MRI training sessions (60-min training time/session), during which they performed a mental calculation task at varying levels of difficulty, in order to learn how to up-regulate dACC activation. Only neurofeedback participants received continuous feedback information on actual brain activation levels within dACC. Before and after the training, ADHD symptoms and relevant cognitive functioning was assessed. Results showed that both groups achieved a significant increase in dACC activation levels over sessions. While there was no significant difference between the neurofeedback and control group in clinical outcome, neurofeedback participants showed stronger improvement on cognitive functioning. The current study demonstrates the general feasibility of the suggested rt-fMRI neurofeedback training approach as a potential novel treatment option for ADHD patients. Due to the study's small sample size, potential clinical benefits need to be further investigated in future studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN12390961.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) suffer from attention deficits, motor hyperactivity, and impulsive behaviour. These impairments are experienced at home, at school, and with friends. Functional imaging studies show that ADHD behaviour and impairments in executive functions (EFs) are mirrored by aberrant neurophysiological functioning. Moreover, several studies show that ADHD behaviour, impairments in EFs, and a lack of self-control contribute to poor school performance. Non-pharmacological interventions such as neurofeedback training (NFT), for instance, aim at improving neurophysiological and neuropsychological functioning as well as behaviour. Consequently, NFT is expected to improve school performance, EFs, and self-control in children with ADHD. Generalization of acquired self-regulation skills from laboratory to real life is crucial for a transfer to everyday situations and is hypothesized to be facilitated via training using virtual reality (VR) environments. Consequently, experiencing NFT in VR is expected to yield greater effects than training in two dimensions (2D). METHODS/DESIGN: Ninety children with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD will be included in the study. Participants may be medicated or unmedicated. After random assignation to one of three conditions, all participants receive 15 training sessions of either near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-based NFT in VR, NIRS-based NFT in 2D, or electromyogram-based biofeedback training in VR. ADHD symptoms, self-control, EF, health-related quality of life, school performance, and motor activity measured via parent, teacher, and child reports or objectively will be assessed before and after the intervention and at a 6 months follow-up. Furthermore, we are interested in parents' expectations about the training's effects. DISCUSSION: This is, to our knowledge, the first study investigating the efficacy of NFT for children with ADHD in a VR compared to a 2D environment. Furthermore, this study will contribute to the discussion about the efficacy and specific and unspecific effects of NFTs in children with ADHD. In addition to commonly assessed variables such as ADHD symptoms, NIRS and behavioural data obtained in EF measures, health-related quality of life, and parents' expectations about the intervention's effects, this study will investigate the effects on self-control, school performance, and motor activity.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) is used for neurofeedback training (NFT). Preliminary results suggest that it can help patients to control their symptoms. This study uses rtfMRI NFT for relapse prevention in alcohol dependence. METHODS/DESIGN: Participants are alcohol-dependent patients who have completed a detoxification programme within the past 6 months and have remained abstinent. Potential participants are screened for eligibility, and those who are eligible are randomly assigned to the treatment group (receiving rtfMRI NFT in addition to treatment as usual) or the control group (receiving only treatment as usual). Participants in both groups are administered baseline assessments to measure their alcohol consumption and severity of dependence and a variety of psychological and behavioural characteristics that are hypothesised to predict success with rtfMRI NFT. During the following 4 months, experimental participants are given six NFT sessions, and before and after each session various alcohol-related measures are taken. Participants in the control group are given the same measures to coincide with their timing in the experimental group. Eight and 12 months after the baseline assessment, both groups are followed up with a battery of measures. The primary research questions are whether NFT can be used to teach participants to down-regulate their brain activation in the presence of alcohol stimuli or to up-regulate their brain activation in response to pictures related to healthy goal pursuits, and, if so, whether this translates into reductions in alcohol consumption. The primary outcome measures will be those derived from the functional brain imaging data. We are interested in improvements (i.e., reductions) in participants' alcohol consumption from pretreatment levels, as indicated by three continuous variables, not simply whether or not the person has remained abstinent. The indices of interest are percentage of days abstinent, drinks per drinking day, and percentage of days of heavy drinking. General linear models will be used to compare the NFT group and the control group on these measures. DISCUSSION: Relapse in alcohol dependence is a recurring problem, and the present evaluation of the role of rtfMRI in its treatment holds promise for identifying a way to prevent relapse.

      "abstract": "Neurofeedback training (NF) is a promising non-pharmacological treatment for ADHD that has been associated with improvement of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-related symptoms as well as changes in electrophysiological measures. However, the functional localization of neural changes following NF compared to an active control condition, and of successful learning during training (considered to be the critical mechanism for improvement), remains largely unstudied. Children with ADHD (N=16, mean age: 11.81, SD: 1.47) were randomly assigned to either slow cortical potential (SCP, n=8) based NF or biofeedback control training (electromyogram feedback, n=8) and performed a combined Flanker/NoGo task pre- and post-training. Effects of NF, compared to the active control, and of learning in transfer trials (approximating successful transfer to everyday life) were examined with respect to clinical outcome and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) changes during inhibitory control. After 20 sessions of training, children in the NF group presented reduced ADHD symptoms and increased activation in areas associated with inhibitory control compared to baseline. Subjects who were successful learners (n=9) also showed increased activation in an extensive inhibitory network irrespective of the type of training. Activation increased in an extensive inhibitory network following NF training, and following successful learning through NF and control biofeedback. Although this study was only powered to detect large effects and clearly requires replication in larger samples, the results suggest a crucial role for learning effects in biofeedback trainings.",

      "abstract": "Neurofeedback training (NFT) of the alpha rhythm has been used for several decades but is still controversial in regards to its trainability and effects on working memory. Alpha rhythm of the frontoparietal region are associated with either the intelligence or memory of healthy subjects and are also related to pathological states. In this study, alpha NFT effects on memory performances were explored. Fifty healthy participants were recruited and randomly assigned into a group receiving a 8-12-Hz amplitude (Alpha) or a group receiving a random 4-Hz amplitude from the range of 7 to 20 Hz (Ctrl). Three NFT sessions per week were conducted for 4 weeks. Working memory was assessed by both a backward digit span task and an operation span task, and episodic memory was assessed using a word pair task. Four questionnaires were used to assess anxiety, depression, insomnia, and cognitive function. The Ctrl group had no change in alpha amplitude and duration. In contrast, the Alpha group showed a progressive significant increase in the alpha amplitude and total alpha duration of the frontoparietal region. Accuracies of both working and episodic memories were significantly improved in a large proportion of participants of the Alpha group, particularly for those with remarkable alpha-amplitude increases. Scores of four questionnaires fell in a normal range before and after NFT. The current study provided supporting evidence for alpha trainability within a small session number compared with that of therapy. The findings suggested the enhancement of working and episodic memory through alpha NFT. Hum Brain Mapp 37:2662-2675, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",
