      "abstract": "AIM: There is a gap in the existing literature regarding the evaluation of the effects of low glycemic index diet (LGID) on Turkish patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), as well as the impact of an LGID on oxidative stress markers in this population. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an LGID on seizure frequency, oxidative stress markers [malondialdehyde (MDA), paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), total antioxidant status (TAS), and total oxidant status (TOS)], mental health, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in Turkish children with DRE. METHODS: The study used a pre-post design without a control group and involved 34 children with DRE. Seizure frequency, dietary intake, anthropometry, and biochemical parameters were assessed at baseline and after 3 months of LGID treatment. Behavioral and emotional difficulties were assessed with the \"Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)\". The depressive symptoms were evaluated using the \"Children's Depression Inventory (CDI)\" and HRQOL was assessed with the \"Pediatric Inventory of Quality of Life (PedsQL)\". RESULTS: Thirty of the 34 included children completed the three-month LGID treatment. By the study's end, 38.2 % (13/34) achieved >50 % seizure reduction and 41.2 % (14/34) were seizure-free. Glucose (p < 0.001), insulin (p = 0.005), CRP (p = 0.046), and triglyceride levels (p = 0.015) significantly decreased. MDA levels decreased (p < 0.001), whereas PON-1 levels increased significantly (p = 0.035). There was a significant improvement in all subscales of the HRQOL (p < 0.001), as well as the total HRQOL and CDI scores (p < 0.001). According to the SDQ, the conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, and emotional symptoms scores were significantly decreased. There was a negative correlation between MDA (r = -0.512, p = 0.005) and LGID efficacy after 3 months of LGID. Serum levels of MDA and glucose were positively correlated (r = 0.412, p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: LGID shows promise in reducing seizures and improving oxidative stress, mental health, and quality of life for pediatric DRE in the short term. Further research is needed to address the limitations (small sample size, no control group, etc.) and investigate LGID's long-term effects.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this research was to evaluate changes in body composition, adipokine levels, and dyslipidemia parameters in males with abdominal obesity following two distinct interventions: exercise alone and exercise combined with an ad libitum diet. METHODS: This study included 44 males with abdominal obesity (mean age 34.7 ± 5.5 years, waist circumference [WC] 110.3 ± 8.5, BMI 32.0 ± 3.9), who were randomly assigned to three groups: an experimental group engaging in aerobic-resistance exercise (II, n = 16), an experimental group engaging in aerobic-resistance exercise combined with an ad libitum high-protein, low-glycemic index carbohydrate diet (III, n = 16), both interventions lasting 6 weeks, and a control group without interventions (I, n = 12). Body composition metrics (body mass index [BMI], waist circumference [WC], body fat [BF], abdominal fat [ABD]) and fat-free mass [FFM], along with biochemical blood analyses (irisin [IR], omentin [OMEN], glucose [GLU], insulin [INS], LDL- and HDL-cholesterol), were measured at baseline and after the 6-week intervention. The effects of the interventions on the analyzed variables across groups were assessed using mixed ANOVA tests with post-hoc comparisons. Effect size (ES) was also calculated using partial eta squared (ηp2). RESULTS: The intervention in group III resulted in a significant decrease in IR (p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.03) by 41% and LDL-C (p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.02) by 14%. These effects were associated with a reduction in BF (p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.02) by 14%, ABD (p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.03) by 31%, and WC (p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.01) by 3%. In group II, decreases after 6 weeks of intervention were noted only in WC (p = 0.02, ηp2 = 0.01) by 1% and in INS (p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.04) by 47%. No differences were found between groups. The use of low-glycemic index carbohydrates (p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.06) and increased protein intake (p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.30) led to changes in the fiber-to-energy value of the diet ratio (p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.18) and a reduction in dietary energy value (p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.13) by 23%, resulting in a greater energy deficit than in the II group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the effect of combining dietary and exercise interventions to achieve significant changes in body composition and metabolic parameters, even over a short period of intervention.",

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 26 healthy women aged ≥ 65 years and with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 26.1 ± 3.5 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to follow a low-GI diet (GI < 55) with protein consumption at the current recommended dietary allowance (RDA, 0.8 g/kg body weight) or twice the RDA (2RDA, 1.6 g/kg body weight). Changes in body weight, BMI, WC, glucose, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), total cholesterol, and triglycerides were assessed at 3- and 6-month of follow-up in all participants. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed using a linear mixed model. RESULTS: Weight loss (mean change -1.7 kg, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.8 to -0.5 kg, p = 0.004) was observed at 6 months, with no significant difference between the RDA and 2RDA groups. An overall significant WC decrease was observed at 6 months in all participants (mean change -3.8 cm, 95% CI -5.5 to -2.1 cm, p < 0.001), with no differences between groups. The glycolipid profile remained unchanged after 6 months of dietary intervention. CONCLUSION: Increasing protein intake did not lead to greater weight loss or reduction in WC in a sample of healthy postmenopausal women following a low-GI diet for 6 months.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite extensive research examining the effect of a low glycemic index (LGI) diet on the frequency of seizures in patients with epilepsy, the findings are inconclusive. Hence, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to clarify the potential effect of a low glycemic index (LGI) diet on the frequency of seizures in children. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis written in accordance with the PRISMA checklist was realized using a comprehensive systematic search in four electronic databases until October 2023 without time or language restrictions. A random effects model was employed to combine the data. The main outcomes were analyzed using weight mean difference (WMD) and 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI). In total, 13 studies met the eligible criteria and were included. RESULTS: The publications included in this study were published between 2005 and 2021. The duration of the interventions in the studies included in this analysis ranged from 6 to 58 weeks. Our findings indicated that the pooled efficacy rate for < 50 %, ≥ 50 %, > 90 % seizure reduction in patients with epilepsy receiving a low glycemic index diet was 39 % (95 % CI: 26, 52), 34 % (95 % CI: 23, 45), and 19 % (95 % CI: 13, 25), respectively. It seems that the efficacy of this ketogenic diet in reducing seizures is greater during a shorter intervention period than 12 weeks. CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that the low glycemia index diet can be beneficial as a treatment for epilepsy in pediatric patients.",

      "abstract": "Dietary restriction, such as low glycemic index diet (LGID), have been successfully used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy. However, if such diet could also counteract antiepileptogenesis is still unclear. Here, we investigated whether the administration of LGID during the latent pre-epileptic period, prevents or delays the appearance of the overt epileptic phenotype. To this aim, we used the Synapsin II knockout (SynIIKO) mouse, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy in which seizures manifest 2-3 months after birth, offering a temporal window in which LGID may affect epileptogenesis. Pregnant SynIIKO mice were fed with either LGID or standard diet during gestation and lactation. Both diets were maintained in weaned mice up to 5 months of age. LGID delayed the seizure onset and induced a reduction of seizures severity only in female SynIIKO mice. In parallel with the epileptic phenotype, high-density multielectrode array recordings revealed a reduction of frequency, amplitude, duration, velocity of propagation and spread of interictal events by LGID in the hippocampus of SynIIKO females, but not mutant males, confirming the gender-specific effect. ELISA-based analysis revealed that LGID increased cortico-hippocampal allopregnanolone (ALLO) levels only in females, while it was unable to affect ALLO plasma concentrations in either sex. The results indicate that the gender-specific interference of LGID with the epileptogenic process can be ascribed to a gender-specific increase in cortical ALLO, a neurosteroid known to strengthen GABAergic transmission. The study highlights the possibility of developing a personalized gender-based therapy for temporal lobe epilepsy.",

This study aims to estimate the effect of interventions with low-GI dietary advice on pregnant outcomes in women with elevated risk of GDM. DESIGN: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) through March 2022. Studies reporting the effect of low-GI diet advice intervention on maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnant women with increased risks of GDM were included. Random or fixed effects model was used to calculate combined treatment effects. Publication bias was assessed via Begg's and Egger's tests and funnel plot inspection. RESULTS: Nine RCTs recruiting 3416 participants were included. Low-GI diet advice did not modulate the risk of GDM. Compared with control diets, low-GI diet advice significantly reduced gestational weight gain (GWG) (weighted mean differences, WMD = -0.93 kg, 95% CI: -1.31, -0.55; p < 0.001; n = 7) and the risk of premature birth (RR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.88; p = 0.012; n = 5). In subgroup analyses, the effect of low-GI diet interventions on premature birth was significant only in women with BMI higher than 30 kg/m2 (RR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.77, p = 0.014; n = 3); the significant effect on GWG was not altered by stratification of BMI and the type of GDM risk factors. No significant changes in other maternal and newborn outcomes were found. CONCLUSIONS: Low-GI diet advice interventions during pregnancy decreased GWG and the risk of premature birth in women with elevated GDM risk; however, the interventions did not significantly prevent GDM development in these women.",

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the effect of a high-protein low-glycemic index (HPLGI) diet on GWG, birth weight, and risk of gestational complications in pregnant women with obesity. METHODS: A total of 279 women with prepregnancy overweight or obesity (BMI: 28-45 kg/m2), between 18 and 45 y old, and in their late first trimester with singleton pregnancies, were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 ad libitum diets: a high-protein low-glycemic index diet (HPLGI: 25%-28% of energy from protein and glycemic index ≤ 55) and a moderate-protein moderate-glycemic index diet (MPMGI: 15%-18% of energy from protein and glycemic index ∼60). Diets were consumed from gestational week 15 and throughout pregnancy. Participants received dietary guidance by a clinical dietician 9 times to facilitate adherence. RESULTS: Out of 141 and 138 women randomly assigned to the HPLGI and MPMGI diets, 105 and 104 completed the intervention, respectively (75%). In the available case analyses, GWG was 6.8 ± 1.3 kg among women assigned the HPLGI diet and this was significantly lower, by -1.7 kg (95% CI: -2.8, -0.5 kg; P = 0.004), than the GWG of 8.5 ± 1.3 kg among women assigned the MPMGI diet. There were no significant differences between diets on major neonatal outcomes (birth weight and other anthropometric measures). The incidence of composite pregnancy complications was lower for the HPLGI than for the MPMGI diet (35.4% compared with 53.7%, respectively; P = 0.009), including cesarean delivery (15.4% compared with 28.8%, respectively; P = 0.03). There were no reported maternal, fetal, or neonatal deaths. Incidence of miscarriages (1%-2%) did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: A moderate increase in dietary protein in conjunction with a reduction in glycemic index during the last 2 trimesters of pregnancy reduced GWG and limited complications and cesarean deliveries among women with overweight or obesity.",

RESULTS: Of 935 initial publications, 542 remain after duplicates removal. Then, 141 records were removed at the title and abstract screening level. After excluding 392 literatures, we finally included 8 articles. The final selected studies included 412 overweight and obese individuals with PCOS (207 cases in LGID group and 205 patients in comparators) with a mean age of 21-32 years. Measured emotional health (3 studies, 132 participants, SMD: -1.97; 95%CI:-3.54, -0.40, P = 0.01, I 2 = 89%) and body hair (3 studies, 132 participants, SMD: -0.40; 95%CI:-0.46, -0.35, P < 0.0001, I 2 = 0%), were found to be significantly lower in women in LGD vs control diet groups. Moreover, infertility (3 studies, 132 participants, SMD: 1.45; 95%CI: 0.30, 2.61, P = 0.01, I 2 = 79%) was significantly higher in women in LGD vs control diet groups. CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis has shown that LGD may play a significant role in reducing the risk and improving the clinical and biochemical features of PCOS. So far the evidences for choosing the best dietary modalities for PCOS are not strong to make a definite recommendation."

      "abstract": "Background: Previous studies have shown an increase in hunger during weight-loss maintenance (WLM) after diet-induced weight loss. Whether a combination of a higher protein, lower glycemic index (GI) diet and physical activity (PA) can counteract this change remains unclear. Aim: To compare the long-term effects of two diets [high protein (HP)-low GI vs. moderate protein (MP)-moderate GI] and two PA programs [high intensity (HI) vs. moderate intensity (MI)] on subjective appetite sensations during WLM after ≥8% weight loss (WL). Methods: Data derived from the 3-years PREVIEW randomized intervention study. An 8-weeks WL phase using a low-energy diet was followed by a 148-weeks randomized WLM phase. For the WLM phase, participants were assigned to one of the four groups: HP-MI, HP-HI, MP-MI, and MP-HI. Available data from 2,223 participants with overweight or obesity (68% women; BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2). Appetite sensations including satiety, hunger, desire to eat, and desire to eat something sweet during the two phases (at 0, 8 weeks and 26, 52, 104, and 156 weeks) were assessed based on the recall of feelings during the previous week using visual analogue scales. Differences in changes in appetite sensations from baseline between the groups were determined using linear mixed models with repeated measures. Results: There was no significant diet × PA interaction. From 52 weeks onwards, decreases in hunger were significantly greater in HP-low GI than MP-moderate GI (P time × diet = 0.018, P dietgroup = 0.021). Although there was no difference in weight regain between the diet groups (P time × diet = 0.630), hunger and satiety ratings correlated with changes in body weight at most timepoints. There were no significant differences in appetite sensations between the two PA groups. Decreases in hunger ratings were greater at 52 and 104 weeks in HP-HI vs. MP-HI, and greater at 104 and 156 weeks in HP-HI vs. MP-MI. Conclusions: This is the first long-term, large-scale randomized intervention to report that a HP-low GI diet was superior in preventing an increase in hunger, but not weight regain, during 3-years WLM compared with a MP-moderate GI diet. Similarly, HP-HI outperformed MP-HI in suppressing hunger. The role of exercise intensity requires further investigation.

Although the clinical and practical value of GI is still being studied, a low GI diet seems to be the most appropriate approach in GDM.

METHODS: The stored plasma samples from the RCT of a low-GI vs. conventional diet in obese children were analyzed for adipokines: leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and visfatin. Their relationships with clinical outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Fifty-two participants completed the 6-month intervention trial (mean age: 12.0 ± 2.0 years, 35 boys). Both groups had significantly decreased BMI z-scores from baseline whereas the low-GI group had significant reduction in fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. There were no differences in adipokines between the groups before and after the intervention. However, there was an association between baseline leptin and the change of fat mass index (FMI) but not the insulin resistance in both groups. The higher the baseline leptin was, the lower the changes were for FMI after the intervention. CONCLUSION: Despite no demonstrable effect of low-GI diet on plasma adipokines, the higher baseline leptin was correlated with lower reduction of fat mass. Leptin resistance may have a detrimental effect on the reduction of adiposity in obese children. Baseline leptin could be a useful predictor of the change in body composition in an obesity intervention trial. IMPACT: Leptin resistance may have a detrimental effect in reducing the adiposity in obese children. This study is the first of its kind to compare the plasma adipokine concentrations of obese children on low-GI diet and conventional diet. We found that serum leptin was significantly correlated with the reduction of BMI z-score and FMI in both groups. Baseline leptin could be a useful predictor of the change in body composition in an obesity intervention trial.",

Low glycemic index therapy (LGIT), the least restrictive with minimal adverse effects among ketogenic dietary therapies has been proven effective in uncontrolled trials, but a placebo-controlled trial in this regard is still lacking. METHODS: In this open-label randomized controlled study, we randomized children above age two years with drug-resistant epilepsy into two groups (LGIT and control groups). Patients in the LGIT group received an add-on low glycemic index diet for 3 months along with the ongoing antiepileptic drugs and the patients in the control group did not receive any dietary intervention. Seizure frequency was assessed from the seizure diary maintained by the parents. Diet compliance was assessed using the diet diary that was maintained by the parents for three days just before the scheduled monthly visits of the patients. RESULTS: Forty children with drug-refractory epilepsy (20 in each group) were enrolled. While 6/20 children in the LGIT arm have >50 % reduction in seizure frequency, none achieved this in the control arm (p = 0.02). The overall compliance with the low glycemic diet in the intervention group was 88.5 %. Out of six responders to LGIT, one child achieved seizure freedom and one achieved >90 % seizure reduction. Five continued LGIT further for a median duration of 8 months (range-4-12 months) successfully. The number needed to treat for more than 50 % seizure reduction was 3 and for more than 90 % seizure reduction was 10. The mean frequency of seizures for the intervention and control groups at three months of follow-up was not significantly different (p = 0.16), but the change in seizure frequency as compared to baseline was better in the intervention arm (p = 0.01). Three patients in the LGIT arm had non-serious adverse events (lethargy in two, vomiting in one). CONCLUSION: In children aged 2-8 years with drug-refractory epilepsy, the administration of LGIT along with ongoing anti-seizure medications (ASM) is more efficacious in reducing seizure frequency as compared to ASM alone.",

METHODS: Parallel-group randomized trial with 26 apparently healthy women aged ≥ 65 years. Participants were randomly assigned to low-glycemic index diets with protein consumption at current RDA (0.8 g/kg body weight) or twice the RDA (2RDA, 1.6 g/kg body weight). Protein intake was assessed by 24-hours urinary nitrogen excretion. Change in LBM was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at 3 and 6 months. Secondary outcomes were appendicular lean mass, handgrip strength by dynamometry, and physical performance by gait speed. RESULTS: Mean age was 70.8 ± 3.6 years, and mean BMI was 26.1 ± 3.5 kg/m2 in the overall sample. The RDA and 2RDA groups did not differ regarding baseline dietary intake. Changes from baseline in LBM (0.07 kg; 95% CI, -0.39; 0.52 kg; P = 0.100) and appendicular lean mass (0.07 kg; 95% CI, -0.34; 0.47 kg; P = 0.100) did not differ between the groups. Total body fat (-1.41 kg; 95% CI, -2.62; 0.20 kg; P = 0.019) and trunk fat mass (-0.90 kg; 95% CI, -1.55; -0.24 kg; P = 0.005) decreased similarly in both groups at the end of intervention. Adjusting for baseline BMI did not alter these findings. Handgrip strength and 4-m gait speed increased after the intervention, with no significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Protein intake exceeding the RDA did not increase LBM, strength, and physical performance in a sample of late postmenopausal woman consuming a low-glycemic index diet for 6 months.",

Ketogenic diets, including the less strict low glycemic index treatment (LGIT), may improve seizure control in pharmacoresistant epilepsy. However, little is known about the quality of life (QoL) in children on LGIT. To explore psychosocial implications of the LGIT on pediatric patients and their caregivers, we have conducted a pilot study to explore the QoL of children and adolescents on the diet. METHODS: Pediatric patients on LGIT and their parents completed standardized, validated QoL questionnaires (Pediatric Quality of Life Epilepsy Module), one retrospectively and one while being on LGIT. An additional questionnaire included two open-ended questions in order to gain a better understanding of personal experiences of families. RESULTS: We enrolled six patients with epilepsy on LGIT between the age of 3 and 13 years. Self-reported QoL decreased in all adolescents, regardless of improvement in seizure control. Parent-reported QoL improved in three of six participants, remained stable in one, and decreased in two patients (both displayed no seizure improvement). Parents and adolescents reported positive experiences of trying new foods and being more health conscious, as well as negative themes such as social isolation and meal preparation difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of improvement in patient-reported QoL points towards an overall negative impact of the LGIT on patient well-being, despite positive effects on seizure control. Our preliminary results indicate that the benefits of seizure control may subjectively be outweighed by adverse social effects of the LGIT. Families should be made aware of psychosocial risks of the diet. Whenever possible, children should be part of the therapeutic decision-making process. Larger prospective studies are required to fully assess the overall impact of the LGIT.",

We aimed to compare the effects of the hypocaloric low glycemic index (LGI) diet on anthropometric variables and insulin resistance in women with and without PCOS and investigate the effect of this diet on the clinical and hormonal features of PCOS women. METHODS: This interventional study was carried out at the Reproductive Endocrinology Research Center, Research Institute for Endocrine Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. Of 108 women invited for the purpose of the present study, 62 participants (PCOS = 28, non-PCOS = 34) followed a 24-week energy restricted LGI diet. Anthropometric, biochemical, hormonal and clinical measurements were documented at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks with intervention. RESULTS: The percentages of weight loss achieved by both the PCOS and non-PCOS groups did not differ significantly (PCOS: -8.04% vs. non-PCOS: -8.09%). No significant difference in decrease of homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was observed between the two groups (PCOS = - 0.83 ± 0.33, non PCOS = - 0.79 ± 0.28, P = 0.83). In PCOS women, significant reduction in total testosterone (- 0.91 ± 0.33 nmol/L, P = 0.006), FAI (- 4.47 ± 1.1, P < 0.001) and increase in SHBG (38.98 ± 11.02 nmol/L, P < 0.001) were observed. Menstrual irregularity was improved in 80% of women with PCOS and a significant decrease (32.1%) in occurrence of acne was reported. CONCLUSIONS: This diet has equally beneficial effects on anthropometric and metabolic characteristics of overweight women with and without PCOS.

METHODS: Overweight and obese pregnant women were recruited before 16 weeks of gestation and randomized to the LGI diet arm or the control arm. All participants received standard dietary education according to the Chinese Dietary Guide for Pregnant Women. In the intervention arm, additional individualized dietary GL assessments were performed using an app and instructions of lowering diet glycemic index (GI) to achieve LGI diet were provided by a clinical dietitian at early, middle, and late gestation. Primary outcomes were serum insulin at late gestation, incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) for mothers, and cord blood C-peptide level of neonates. RESULTS: In total, 400 subjects were randomized and received different interventions. There were no significant differences in maternal serum insulin levels (13.2 [9.3-13.2] uU/mL vs 12.4 [10.5-12.4] uU/mL), incidence of GDM (45 [22.5%] vs 43 [21.5%]), or cord blood C-peptide levels (mean 0.9ng/mL [SD 0.7] vs mean 0.8ng/mL [SD 0.6]) in the intervention group compared with the controls. The diet GI at late gestation was similar (mean 63.2 [SD 10.4] vs mean 64.3 [SD 10.4]), whereas greater diet fiber intake was observed in the intervention group (mean 11.6 grams [SD 8.0] vs mean 9.0 grams [SD 5.6]; P=.006). Adherence measurements did not significantly differ between 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Individualized LGI diet consultations for overweight and obese pregnant women failed to make a significant difference in maternal or neonatal insulin resistance compared with the standard gestational diet consultation.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the influence of low-GI diet on gestational diabetes.Methods: PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Cochrane library databases were systematically searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of low-GI diet on gestational diabetes were included. Two investigators independently searched articles, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies. This meta-analysis was performed using the random-effect model.Results: Six RCTs involving 532 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, compared with a control intervention in gestational diabetes, low-GI diet was found to significantly reduce 2 h postprandial glucose (Std.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A parallel, randomized trial with three intervention diets: an LGI diet, an HGI diet, and an LF diet. A total of 122 adult overweight and obese subjects were enrolled in the study for 6 months. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at the end of the intervention. The plasma metabolomic profile of 102 subjects was analyzed using three different approaches: GC/quadrupole-TOF, LC/quadrupole-TOF, and nuclear magnetic resonance. Both univariate and multivariate analysis were performed. Serine levels were significantly higher following the LGI diet compared to both the HGI and LF diets (q = 0.002), whereas leucine (q = 0.015) and valine (q = 0.024) were lower in the LGI diet compared to the LF diet. A set of two sphingomyelins, two lysophosphatidylcholines, and six phosphatidylcholines were significantly modulated after the LGI diet compared to the HGI and LF diets (q < 0.05). Significant correlations between changes in plasma amino acids and lipid species with changes in body weight, glucose, insulin, and some inflammatory markers are also reported. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that an LGI diet modulates certain circulating amino acids and lipid levels. These findings may explain the health benefits attributed to LGI diets in metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes.",

We here present results from a subgroup of participants in the diet and control group to assess the feasibility of a high protein and low glycemic index (GI) diet and the effects on body composition. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Of the 149 subjects who were included in the study, 76 subjects (30 males) were randomized into either a diet group (n = 38) or a control group (n = 38) and included in the present analysis. The 8 week intervention consisted of a high protein and low GI diet whilst the control group continued habitual diet. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients in the diet and 34 in the control group completed the study. The diet group reduced their energy intake by ~20% and had high dietary compliance. Intake of fatty fish doubled and GI was reduced by 8.4 units. The diet group reduced their weight by 2.3 ± 2.2 kg vs. 0.5 ± 1.8 (p < 0.001), fat mass by 2.2 ± 2.0 kg vs. 0.3 ± 1.6 kg (p < 0.001) and preserved lean body mass (-0.02 ± 1.1 kg). The control group had no changes in body composition. CONCLUSIONS: The ad libitum high protein-low GI diet resulted in a greater loss of fat mass among non-obese patients with asthma.

METHODS: A case-control study (1:3) included single pregnant women with Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2, enrolled at 1st trimester. Cases (N.=95) were prescribed (by both the dietitian and gynecologist) a low-glycemic-index diet with an average intake of 1700/1800 kcal/day plus 30 minutes of walking at least 3 times/week (with four follow-up visits until delivery). Controls (N.=275) received a nutritional booklet about a healthy lifestyle, then attended their scheduled visits until delivery by the obstetricians in charge. RESULTS: Gestational weight gain was similar between groups, despite obese women were higher in cases (67.4%) than in controls (54.5%, P=0.029). The occurrence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was lower in cases (21.5%) than in controls (32.7%; P=0.041). Such reduction remained related with the group of intervention (P=0.004) after correcting for confounders (BMI≥30 kg/m2, a family history of diabetes, age ≥35 and ethnicity). A higher number of controls developed pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) (11.6% vs. 1.1% in cases, P<0.001). Preterm birth (PTB) occurred in one case and in 28 controls (10.2%; P=0.004). In half of them, PTB was spontaneous while medically indicated for intrauterine growth restriction, hemorrhage, PIH, GDM/macrosomia, Rh isoimmunization in the remnant.

Low glycemic index (LGI) diets may improve both diabetes and cardiovascular risk but their effects on cardiac injury and fibrosis have not been previously studied. To test the effect of a LGI diet on markers of subclinical cardiac injury and fibrosis, we assessed the effect of a LGI compared with a high-cereal fibre diet on high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) and galectin-3 in otherwise healthy individuals with T2DM in an exploratory analysis of a completed randomized trial. METHODS: A total of 201 participants completed the trial and had measurements of hs-cTnI and galectin-3 at baseline and at trial completion. Participants were randomized to follow a LGI or a high-cereal fibre diet over a 6-month period. Treatment differences were tested using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with sex, baseline values, and diet x sex interaction included as covariates. RESULTS: In a completer's analysis, no significant differences were observed for change in hs-cTnI (-0.16ng/L vs. -0.22ng/L, p=0.713) and galectin-3 levels (0.64μg/L vs. 0.14μg/L, p=0.166) when a LGI diet was compared to a high-cereal fibre diet. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of a LGI diet was similar to a high-cereal fibre diet on hs-cTnI and galectin-3 levels in otherwise healthy individuals with T2DM over a 6-month period. Nevertheless, in the absence of any adverse effects, LGI diets remain an option for diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk management. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00438698.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Excessive weight gain is commonly observed within the first year after kidney transplantation and is associated with negative outcomes, such as graft loss and cardiovascular events. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a high protein and low glycemic-index diet on preventing weight gain after kidney transplantation. METHODS: We designed a prospective, single-center, open-label, randomized controlled study to compare the efficacy of a high protein (1.3-1.4 g/kg/day) and low-glycemic index diet versus a conventional diet (0.8-1.0 g/kg/day of protein) on preventing weight gain after kidney transplantation. A total of 120 eligible patients 2 months after transplantation will be recruited. Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate through the modification of diet of renal disease (MDRD) formula < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or urinary albumin excretion > 300 mg/24 h will be excluded. Patients' diets will be allocated through simple sequential randomization. Patients will be followed-up for 12 months with nine clinic appointments with a dietitian and the evaluations will include nutritional assessment (anthropometrics, body composition, and resting metabolic rate) and laboratory tests. The primary outcome is weight maintenance or body weight gain under 5% after 12 months. Secondary outcomes include body composition, resting metabolic rate, satiety sensation, kidney function, and other metabolic parameters. DISCUSSION: Diets with higher protein content and lower glycemic index may lead to weight loss because of higher satiety sensation. However, there is a concern about the association of high protein intake and kidney damage. Nevertheless, there is little evidence on the impact of high protein intake on long-term kidney function outcome. Therefore, we designed a study to test if a high protein diet with low-glycemic index will be an effective and safe nutritional intervention to prevent weight gain in kidney transplant patients.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mechanisms influencing breast cancer (BC) development and recurrence include hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, high insulin-like growth factor-1, high circulating estrogen, inflammation and impaired cellular differentiation/apoptosis. A lifestyle program that targets all the above mechanisms may be warranted. Low glycemic index (GI) foods produce lower post-prandial glucose and insulin responses and have been associated with lower BC risk. Moderate physical activity post-diagnosis reduces BC recurrence and mortality, partly explained by reduced insulin and estrogen levels. Vitamin D increases cell differentiation/apoptosis and high serum vitamin D levels improve BC survival. Yet no trial has evaluated the combined effect of a low GI diet, moderate physical activity and vitamin D supplementation on BC recurrence in the context of a Mediterranean lifestyle setting. METHODS: Women (30-74 yr) who had undergone surgery for primary histologically confirmed BC (stages I-III) within the previous 12 months, in cancer centres in Italy, will be randomized to follow, for a maximum of 33 months, either a high intensity treatment (HIT) composed of low GI diet + exercise + vitamin D (60 ng/mL serum concentration) or a lower intensity treatment (LITE) with general advice to follow a healthy diet and exercise pattern + vitamin D to avoid insufficiency. Both interventions are on a background of a Mediterranean diet. Considering a 20% recurrence rate within 3 years for BC cases and a predicted rate of 10% in the HIT group, with power of 80% and two-sided alpha of 0.05, the subject number required will be 506 (n = 253 in each arm). Clinic visits will be scheduled every 3 months. Dietary and exercise counselling and vitamin D supplements will be given at each clinic visit when blood samples, anthropometric measures and 7-day food records will be collected. DISCUSSION: DEDiCa study aims to reduce BC recurrence in women with BC using a lifestyle approach with additional vitamin D and to investigate possible cardio-metabolic benefits as well as epigenetic modifications according to lifestyle changes. Given the supporting evidence and safety of the components of our intervention we believe it is feasible and urgent to test it in cancer patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: May 11, 2016; NCT02786875 .

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled parallel trial, twenty subjects (aged 42.4 ± 5.1 years, BMI 29.2 ± 4.8 kg.m-2) were allocated to low GI (LGI) (n = 10) or high GI (HGI) (n = 10) groups. Body composition, inflammatory and metabolic markers were assessed at baseline and after 30 days of intervention. Food intake was monitored during the study using three-day food records completed on two non-consecutive weekdays and on a weekend day. RESULTS: Body fat reduced after the LGI intervention compared with baseline (P = 0.043) and with the HGI group (P = 0.036). Serum fructosamine concentration (P = 0.031) and TNF-α mRNA expression (P = 0.05) increased in the HGI group. Serum non-esterified fatty acids were greater in the HGI than in the LGI group (P = 0.032). IL-6 mRNA expression tended to decrease after the consumption of the LGI diet compared to baseline (P = 0.06). CONCLUSION: The LGI diet reduced body fat and prevented the negative metabolic and inflammatory responses induced by the HGI diet.",

We investigated the effect of a low glycemic index (LGI) diet on insulin concentration, fasting blood sugar (FBS), inflammatory markers, and serum adiponectin concentration among healthy obese/overweight adolescent females. In this parallel randomized clinical trial, 2 different diets, an LGI diet and a healthy nutritional recommendation diet (HNRD) with similar macronutrient composition were prescribed to 50 obese and overweight adolescent girls with the same pubertal status. Biochemical markers FBS, serum insulin concentration, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and adiponectin were measured before and after a 10 week intervention. Using an intention-to-treat analysis, data from 50 subjects were analyzed. According to a dietary assessment, GI in the LGI group was 43.22±0.54. While the mean for FBS, serum insulin concentration, the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), and adiponectin concentration did not differ significantly within each group, the average hs-CRP and IL-6 decreased significantly in the LGI diet group after the 10 week intervention (p=0.009 and p=0.001; respectively). Comparing percent changes, we found a marginally significant decrease in hs-CRP in the LGI group compared with the HNRD group after adjusting for confounders. Compliance with an LGI diet may have favorable effect on inflammation among overweight and obese adolescent girls.",

The most important therapeutic intervention for metabolic syndrome is diet modification, an intervention whose efficacy has been proven for metabolic syndrome. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of low glycemic index diet versus metformin on MetS components in adults with MetS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-one adults with MetS participated in this randomized controlled clinical trial. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups of metformin and low glycemic index diet. The intervention period was eight weeks. The studied participants were compared at baseline and the end of the trial, regarding the following factors: weight, blood pressure, waist circumference, fasting blood sugar, hemoglobin A1c and lipid profiles (Triglyceride (TG), Total Cholesterol (TC), Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol). RESULTS: The anthropometric measurements, Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS), Hemoglobin A1c, serum lipid profiles (TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C) and lipoprotein ratio (LDL/HDL) showed a significant decrease after the intervention in both groups (P < 0.05). Comparison of the difference between the two groups was not significant, except for the mean reduction in FBS, which was more in the metformin group although this was not clinically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the assumption that low glycemic index diet as well as metformin can positively affect metabolic syndrome components."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome is an autosomal, dominantly inherited neurometabolic disorder caused by mutations in the SLC2A1 gene. Decreased glucose transport into the brain results in seizures and cognitive dysfunction. The ketogenic diet is the treatment of choice, but complicated with compliance problems. Stabilization of blood glucose levels by low glycemic index diet and modified high amylopectin cornstarch would provide steady-state glucose transport into the brain to prevent seizures and cognitive dysfunction in patients with glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome as an alternative treatment. PATIENT: We report a new glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome patient (c.988C>T; p. Arg330X in the SLC2A1) treated with modified high amylopectin cornstarch (Glycosade) and low glycemic index diet because of compliance problems with the ketogenic diet. She was diagnosed at 11.5 years of age and was treated with the ketogenic diet between ages 12 and 18 years. RESULTS: She was started on modified high amylopectin cornstarch at bedtime and low glycemic index diet with meals and snacks every 3-4 hours. Within the first 6 months of therapy, she improved in her seizures and cognitive functions, but experienced compliance problems afterwards. Neuropsychological assessment was stable at 12 months of therapy. CONCLUSION: This diet was easy to apply compared with the ketogenic diet and resulted in stable neuropsychological functioning of this glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome patient. Modified high amylopectin cornstarch and low glycemic index diet might be an alternative treatment in glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome patients with compliance problems to the ketogenic diet treatment, but additional patients should be treated to prove usefulness of this new treatment.",

METHODS: In this observational study we advised thirty mostly obese patients with type 2 diabetes to follow a protein-enriched diet with carbohydrates of low glycemic index (low GI) and moderate fat reduction supplemented with omega-3 PUFA for 24 weeks. Primary efficacy parameter was the change in HbA1c; secondary parameters included changes in systemic inflammation (measured by ultrasensitive C-reactive protein, usCRP), body weight, waist circumference, fat mass. The study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01474603). RESULTS: The dietary intervention significantly reduced the primary efficacy variable HbA1c from a baseline value of 63±11mmol/mol to 59±14mmol/mol (P=0.033) and 56±12mmol/mol (P=0.001) after 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. In addition, usCRP decreased significantly at 24 weeks (P=0.039). Waist circumference, an important indicator for cardiometabolic-risk and silent inflammation, decreased from baseline 116.0±14.1cm to 114.9±13.5cm (P=0.019), 114.0±14.4cm (P=0.001), and 112.7±13.4cm (P=0.049), after 3, 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. CONCLUSION: Counseling a protein enriched and low glycemic index diet supplemented with long-chain omega-3 PUFA in a real-life clinical setting improves glycemic control and also reduces waist circumference and silent inflammation in overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes.",

In early pregnancy and at 28 weeks, serum was analyzed for insulin, leptin, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). At delivery, cord blood concentrations of leptin, TNF-α, IL-6, and C-peptide were recorded. We found no difference between those who did or did not receive low GI advice with respect to the concentrations of any marker in early pregnancy, at 28 weeks or in cord blood. Women in the intervention arm of the study did have a lower overall rise in insulin concentrations from early pregnancy to 28 weeks gestation, P = .04. Of the women in the intervention arm, 20% were in the highest quartile for insulin change (28-week insulin - insulin at booking) compared to 29% of controls (P = .02). In conclusion, a low GI diet in pregnancy has little effect on leptin and markers of inflammation although an attenuated response to the typical increase in insulin resistance seen in pregnancy with advancing gestation was seen in those who received the low GI advice.",

This 10-week parallel randomized clinical trial comprised of 50 overweight or obese and sexually mature girls less than 18 years of age years, who were randomly assigned to LGI or HNR-based diet. Macronutrient distribution was equivalently prescribed in both groups. Blood pressure, weight and waist circumference were measured at baseline and after intervention. Of the 50 participants, 41 subjects (include 82%) completed the study. The GI of the diet in the LGI group was 42.67 ± 0.067. A within-group analysis illustrated that in comparison to the baseline values, the body weight and body mass index (not waist circumference and blood pressure) decreased significantly after the intervention in both groups (P = 0.0001). The percent changes of the body weight status, waist circumference and blood pressure were compared between the two groups and the findings did not show any difference between the LGI diet consumers and those in the HNR group. In comparison to the HNR, LGI diet could not change the weight and blood pressure following a 10-week intervention. Further longitudinal studies with a long-term follow up should be conducted in this regard."

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting 5% to 10% of women worldwide. Approximately half of women with PCOS are lean, yet may still present with central obesity and metabolic disturbances. Low-glycemic index (GI) dietary intervention studies have demonstrated improvements in insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant populations; however, there is little evidence of this effect in women with PCOS. This research aimed to determine the efficacy of an isocaloric low-GI dietary intervention on insulin sensitivity, independent of weight change, in women with PCOS. A nonrandomized 12-week low-GI dietary intervention, preceded by a 12-week habitual diet control phase and proceeded by a 12-week follow-up phase was conducted. Dietary intake, body composition, and metabolic risk markers were determined at baseline, after completion of the habitual diet control phase, and after the low-GI dietary intervention. Twenty-six participants were recruited at baseline, 22 commenced and 21 participants completed the low-GI dietary intervention phase. The primary outcome was change in insulin sensitivity. Secondary outcomes included assessment of changes to lipids, body composition, and estimated macronutrient intake. Repeated measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction were used to detect changes to outcomes across study timepoints. Twenty-one women with PCOS with mean (± standard deviation) age of 32.1±6.7 years completed the 12-week low-GI dietary intervention. As expected, no significant changes occurred during the 12-week habitual diet control phase. However, during the dietary intervention phase, dietary GI decreased from 54.5±3.5 to 48.6±5.1 (P<0.001) with a concurrent small reduction in saturated fat intake (12.4%±3% to 11.7%±3% contribution from energy, P=0.03), despite no specific recommendations to modify fat intake. Measures of insulin sensitivity and nonesterified fatty acid improved after intervention (P=0.03 and P=0.01, respectively). This is the first study to implement an isocaloric low-GI diet in women with PCOS and findings may contribute to the limited research in this area.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Legumes, including beans, chickpeas, and lentils, are among the lowest glycemic index (GI) foods and have been recommended in national diabetes mellitus (DM) guidelines. Yet, to our knowledge, they have never been used specifically to lower the GI of the diet. We have therefore undertaken a study of low-GI foods in type 2 DM with a focus on legumes in the intervention. METHODS: A total of 121 participants with type 2 DM were randomized to either a low-GI legume diet that encouraged participants to increase legume intake by at least 1 cup per day, or to increase insoluble fiber by consumption of whole wheat products, for 3 months. The primary outcome was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values with calculated coronary heart disease (CHD) risk score as a secondary outcome. RESULTS: The low-GI legume diet reduced HbA1c values by -0.5% (95% CI, -0.6% to -0.4%) and the high wheat fiber diet reduced HbA1c values by -0.3% (95% CI, -0.4% to -0.2%). The relative reduction in HbA1c values after the low-GI legume diet was greater than after the high wheat fiber diet by -0.2% (95% CI, -0.3% to -0.1%; P < .001). The respective CHD risk reduction on the low-GI legume diet was -0.8% (95% CI, -1.4% to -0.3%; P = .003), largely owing to a greater relative reduction in systolic blood pressure on the low-GI legume diet compared with the high wheat fiber diet (-4.5 mm Hg; 95% CI, -7.0 to -2.1 mm Hg; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Incorporation of legumes as part of a low-GI diet improved both glycemic control and reduced calculated CHD risk score in type 2 DM.",

Thus, we determined the effects of exercise training with a low (LoGIx)- or high (HiGIx)-glycemic index diet on the severity of the metabolic syndrome (Z-score). METHODS: Twenty-one adults (66.2±1.1 years; BMI=35.3±0.9 kg/m2) with the metabolic syndrome were randomized to 12 weeks of exercise (60 min/day for 5 days/week at about 85% HRmax) and provided a LoGIx (n=11) or HiGIx (n=10) diet. Z-scores were determined from: blood pressure, triglycerides (TGs), high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and waist circumference (WC) before and after the intervention. Body composition, aerobic fitness, insulin resistance, and nonesterfied fatty acid (NEFA) suppression were also assessed. RESULTS: LoGIx and HiGIx diets decreased body mass and insulin resistance and increased aerobic fitness comparably (p<0.05). LoGIx and HiGIx diets decreased the Z-score similarly as each intervention decreased blood pressure, TGs, FPG and WC (p<0.05). The HiGIx diet tended to suppress NEFA during insulin stimulation compared with the LoGIx diet (p=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that exercise with weight loss reduces the severity of the metabolic syndrome whether individuals were randomized to a HiGIx or a LoGIx diet.",

We aimed to investigate the effect of a low-glycemic index (LGI) versus a conventional high-fiber diet on pregnancy outcomes, neonatal anthropometry, and maternal metabolic profile in GDM. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Ninety-nine women (age 26-42 years; mean ± SD prepregnancy BMI 24 ± 5 kg/m²) diagnosed with GDM at 20-32 weeks' gestation were randomized to follow either an LGI (n = 50; target glycemic index [GI] ~50) or a high-fiber moderate-GI diet (HF) (n = 49; target GI ~60). Dietary intake was assessed by 3-day food records. Pregnancy outcomes were collected from medical records. RESULTS: The LGI group achieved a modestly lower GI than the HF group (mean ± SEM 47 ± 1 vs. 53 ± 1; P < 0.001). At birth, there was no significant difference in birth weight (LGI 3.3 ± 0.1 kg vs. HF 3.3 ± 0.1 kg; P = 0.619), birth weight centile (LGI 52.5 ± 4.3 vs. HF 52.2 ± 4.0; P = 0.969), prevalence of macrosomia (LGI 2.1% vs. HF 6.7%; P = 0.157), insulin treatment (LGI 53% vs. HF 65%; P = 0.251), or adverse pregnancy outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In intensively monitored women with GDM, an LGI diet and a conventional HF diet produce similar pregnancy outcomes.",

AIM: The purpose of the study was to compare the effects of two diets, with similar energy intakes, but different glycemic indexes in a pediatric outpatient setting. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A parallel- group, randomized controlled trial was conducted, and 22 obese outpatient children with a body mass index (BMI) Z-score >2 (11 females and 11 males, BMI 28.9±2.9 kg/m²) were included in the study. Patients were randomly allocated to a hypocaloric LGI (GI:60), or to a hypocaloric high glycemic index (HGI) diet (GI:90). The LGI and HGI diets were almost equivalent for macronutrient composition. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured at baseline and after 6 months. RESULTS: In both groups there were significant decreases in BMI, BMI Z-score, blood pressure, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Only LGI diets produced a significant decrease in waist circumference and homeostasis model assessment. Analysis of variance demonstrated that the BMI Z-score decrease from baseline values was significantly greater after the LGI diet than after the HGI diet [-0.20 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.29 to -0.10) vs -0.34 (95%CI -0.43 to -0.24)], mean difference between groups -0.14 (95%CI -0.27 to -0.01), p<0.05). Changes in triglyceride concentrations were significantly lower in LGI as compared to HGI diet (p<0.05).

We investigated the effects of 2 high-carbohydrate (55%) diets with low GI (LGI; 79) or high GI (HGI; 103) on postprandial blood profile, subjective appetite sensations, energy expenditure (EE), substrate oxidation rates, and ad libitum energy intake (EI) from a corresponding test meal (LGI or HGI) after consuming the diets ad libitum for 10 wk. Two groups of a total of 29 healthy, overweight women (age: 30.5 ± 6.6 y; BMI: 27.6 ± 1.5 kg/m(2)) participated in the 10-wk intervention and a subsequent 4-h meal test. The breakfast test meals differed in GI but were equal in total energy, macronutrient composition, fiber content, and energy density. The LGI meal resulted in lower plasma glucose, serum insulin, and plasma glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and higher plasma glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide concentrations than the HGI meal (P ≤ 0.05). Ratings of fullness were slightly higher and the desire to eat something fatty was lower after the test meal in the LGI group (P < 0.05). Postprandial plasma GLP-2, plasma glucagon, serum leptin, plasma ghrelin, EE, substrate oxidation rates, and ad libitum EI at lunch did not differ between groups. In conclusion, postprandial glycemia, insulinemia, and subjective appetite ratings after a test meal were better after 10-wk ad libitum intake of a LGI compared to a HGI diet. EE and substrate oxidation rates were, however, not affected. These findings give some support to recommendations to consume a LGI diet.",

We examined the effect of a short-term (7-day) low-glycemic index (LGI) diet and aerobic exercise training intervention (EX) on IMCL and insulin sensitivity in older, insulin-resistant humans. Participants (66 ± 1 yr, BMI 33 ± 1 kg/m(2)) were randomly assigned to a parallel, controlled feeding trial [either an LGI (LGI/EX, n = 7) or high GI (HGI/EX, n = 8) eucaloric diet] combined with supervised exercise (60 min/day, 85% HR(max)). Insulin sensitivity was determined via 40 mU·m(-2)·min(-1) hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and soleus IMCL and EMCL content was assessed by (1)H-MR spectroscopy with correction for fiber orientation. BMI decreased (kg/m(2) -0.6 ± 0.2, LGI/EX; -0.7 ± 0.2, HGI/EX P < 0.0004) after both interventions with no interaction effect of diet composition. Clamp-derived insulin sensitivity increased by 0.91 ± 0.21 (LGI/EX) and 0.17 ± 0.55 mg·kg(-1)·min(-1) (HGI/EX), P = 0.04 (effect of time). HOMA-IR was reduced by -1.1 ± 0.4 (LGI/EX) and -0.1 ± 0.2 (HGI/EX), P = 0.007 (effect of time), P = 0.02 (time × trial). Although both interventions increased IMCL content, (Δ: 2.3 ± 1.3, LGI/EX; 1.4 ± 0.9, HGI/EX, P = 0.03), diet composition did not significantly effect the increase. However, the LGI/EX group showed a robust increase in the [IMCL]/[EMCL] ratio compared with the HGI/EX group (Δ: 0.5 ± 0.2 LGI/EX vs. 0.07 ± 0.1, P = 0.03). The LGI/EX group also demonstrated greater reductions in [EMCL] than the HGI/EX group (Δ: -5.8 ± 3.4, LGI/EX; 2.3 ± 1.1, HGI/EX, P = 0.03). Changes in muscle lipids and insulin sensitivity were not correlated; however, the change in [IMCL]/[EMCL] was negatively associated with the change in FPI (r = -0.78, P = 0.002) and HOMA-IR (r = -0.61, P = 0.03). These data suggest that increases in the IMCL pool following a low glycemic diet and exercise intervention may represent lipid repartitioning from EMCL. The lower systemic glucose levels that prevail while eating a low glycemic diet may promote redistribution of lipid stores in the muscle.",

All food and fluids were provided during the study. Inflammation was assessed from cytokine (TNFα and IL-6) secretion using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) stimulated overnight with LPS. Glycemic response was determined following ingestion of a 75-g glucose solution. Fasting blood samples were collected for additional cytokine [TNFα, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1)] analysis. Both interventions decreased BMI (P < 0.001), fasting plasma glucose (P = 0.01), and insulin (P = 0.02). The glycemic response was reduced only in the LGI group (P = 0.04). Plasma and MNC-derived TNFα secretion were reduced in the LGI group (P = 0.02) but increased in the HGI group (P = 0.02). Secretion of IL-6 from MNC and plasma IL-6 and MCP-1 concentrations were reduced in the LGI group. The change in MNC-derived TNFα (r = 0.43; P = 0.04) and plasma MCP-1 (r = 0.44; P = 0.04) correlated with decreases in the glycemic response. These data highlight the importance of diet composition in the treatment and prevention of inflammation and hyperglycemia.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The optimal lifestyle intervention that reverses diabetes risk factors is not known. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effect of a low-glycemic index (GI) diet and exercise intervention on glucose metabolism and insulin secretion in obese, prediabetic individuals. DESIGN: Twenty-two participants [mean ± SEM age: 66 ± 1 y; body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 34.4 ± 0.8] underwent a 12-wk exercise-training intervention (1 h/d for 5 d/wk at ≈ 85% of maximum heart rate) while randomly assigned to receive either a low-GI diet (LoGIX; 40 ± 0.3 units) or a high-GI diet (HiGIX; 80 ± 0.6 units). Body composition (measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography), insulin sensitivity (measured with a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp with [6,6-(2)H(2)]-glucose), and oral glucose-induced insulin and incretin hormone secretion were examined. RESULTS: Both groups lost equal amounts of body weight (-8.8 ± 0.9%) and adiposity and showed similar improvements in peripheral tissue (+76.2 ± 14.9%) and hepatic insulin sensitivity (+27.1 ± 7.1%) (all P < 0.05). However, oral glucose-induced insulin secretion was reduced only in the LoGIX group (6.59 ± 0.86 nmol in the prestudy compared with 4.70 ± 0.67 nmol in the poststudy, P < 0.05), which was a change related to the suppressed postprandial response of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide. When corrected for changes in β cell glucose exposure, changes in insulin secretion were attenuated in the LoGIX group but became significantly elevated in the HiGIX group. CONCLUSIONS: Although lifestyle-induced weight loss improves insulin resistance in prediabetic individuals, postprandial hyperinsulinemia is reduced only when a low-GI diet is consumed. In contrast, a high-GI diet impairs pancreatic β cell and intestinal K cell function despite significant weight loss. These findings highlight the important role of the gut in mediating the effects of a low-GI diet on type 2 diabetes risk reduction.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To review the effects of dietary fiber and a low glycemic index diet on glycemic risk factors in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or T2DM and dyslipidemia. DATA SOURCES: Literature search was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Library, The Natural Standard, and The Natural Medicines through July 2010 using the terms type 2 diabetes mellitus, dietary fiber, psyllium, and glycemic index. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles included were randomized controlled studies or meta-analyses examining the effects of dietary interventions (dietary fiber, low glycemic index diet, or psyllium) on glycemic risk factors (glycosylated hemoglobin A₁(c) [A1C] or postprandial plasma glucose [PPG] concentrations) in subjects with T2DM or T2DM and dyslipidemia. DATA SYNTHESIS: Both psyllium supplementation and low glycemic index diets have been studied as monotherapy in the treatment of T2DM. Seven studies were reviewed (3 randomized crossover studies, 1 randomized parallel study, 3 randomized blinded parallel studies). Individually, psyllium supplementation and a low glycemic index diet improved glycemic risk factors. PPG and A1C decreased with psyllium 10.2 g per day, while A1C decreased with a low glycemic index diet (average glycemic index 59). However, the results for the low glycemic index diet are controversial. One study was underpowered to detect changes in A1C, while another study had psyllium fiber as a confounding variable. CONCLUSIONS: Psyllium supplementation might be an additional therapeutic option for people with T2DM who are already receiving diabetes medication and who still experience elevated PPG concentrations. Further well-designed clinical trials and adjustment for confounding variables are needed to determine the role of a low glycemic index diet in the treatment of T2DM.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This randomized controlled study was conducted to determine the effect of low glycemic index (GI) dietary advice on eating patterns and dietary quality in Asian patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). METHODS: Asian patients with T2DM (N  =  104) were randomized into 2 groups that received either low GI or conventional carbohydrate exchange (CCE) dietary advice for 12 weeks. Nutritional prescriptions were based on the medical nutrition therapy for T2DM, with the difference being in the GI component of the carbohydrates. Dietary intake and food choices were assessed with the use of a 3-day food record. RESULTS: At week 12, both groups achieved the recommendations for carbohydrate (52 ± 4% and 54 ± 4% of energy) and fat (30 ± 4% and 28 ± 5% of energy) intake. There were no significant differences in the reported macronutrient intake in both groups. With the low GI diet, crude fiber and dietary calcium intake increased, while the dietary GI reduced. Subjects in the lowest dietary glycemic index/glycemic load (GI/GL) quartile consumed more parboiled/basmati rice, pasta, milk/dairy products, fruits, and dough, which are foods from the low GI category. There was a significant reduction in the hemoglobin A(1c) level at week 12 for patients in the lowest GI/GL quartile (Δ  =  -0.7 ± 0.1%) compared with those in the highest GI/GL quartile (Δ  =  -0.1 ± 0.2%). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the ability of low GI dietary advice to improve the dietary quality of Asian patients with T2DM.",

However, the longer-term effects and potentially involved mechanisms are largely unknown. We exposed four groups of male C57BL/6J mice (n = 10 per group) to long-term (20 wk) or short-term (6 wk) isoenergetic and macronutrient matched diets only differing in starch type and as such GI. Body composition, liver fat, molecular factors of lipid metabolism, and markers of insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility were investigated in all four groups of mice. Mice fed the high GI diet showed a rapid-onset (from week 5) marked increase in body fat mass and liver fat, a gene expression profile in liver consistent with elevated lipogenesis, and, after long-term exposure, significantly reduced glucose clearance following a glucose load. The long-term high-GI diet also led to a delayed switch to both carbohydrate and fat oxidation in the postprandial state, indicating reduced metabolic flexibility. In contrast, no difference in carbohydrate oxidation was observed after short-term high- vs. low-GI exposure. However, fatty acid oxidation was significantly blunted as early as 3 wk after beginning of the high-GI intervention, at a time where most measured phenotypic markers including body fat mass were comparable between groups. Thus long-term high-GI feeding resulted in an obese, insulin-resistant, and metabolically inflexible phenotype in obesity-prone C57BL/6J mice. Early onset and significantly impaired fatty acid oxidation preceded these changes, thereby indicating a potentially causal involvement.",

A low-glycemic index diet is commonly advised as treatment for women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, the efficacy of this advice and associated pregnancy outcomes have not been systematically examined. The purpose of this study was to determine whether prescribing a low-glycemic index diet for women with GDM could reduce the number of women requiring insulin without compromise of pregnancy outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: All women with GDM seen over a 12-month period were considered for inclusion in the study. Women (n = 63) were randomly assigned to receive either a low-glycemic index diet or a conventional high-fiber (and higher glycemic index) diet. RESULTS: Of the 31 women randomly assigned to a low-glycemic index diet, 9 (29%) required insulin. Of the women randomly assigned to a higher-glycemic index diet, a significantly higher proportion, 19 of 32 (59%), met the criteria to commence insulin treatment (P = 0.023). However, 9 of these 19 women were able to avoid insulin use by changing to a low-glycemic index diet. Key obstetric and fetal outcomes were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Using a low-glycemic index diet for women with GDM effectively halved the number needing to use insulin, with no compromise of obstetric or fetal outcomes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The development of obesity has been suggested to involve plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and tissue inhibitor of proteinases-1 (TIMP-1). Plasma PAI-1 is elevated in obesity. A low-glycemic-index (LGI) diet may have a beneficial effect on obesity through a decrease in plasma PAI-1, but whether it affects plasma TIMP-1 in healthy humans has not been studied. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether a 10-wk intake of an LGI or a high-glycemic-index (HGI), high-carbohydrate, low-fat, ad libitum diet is associated with decreases in plasma PAI-1 and TIMP-1 concentrations in overweight women. DESIGN: Forty-four overweight women [body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2): 27.5+/-0.23] were randomly assigned to consume an HGI or an LGI diet for 10 wk. A subgroup of 29 women was assigned to participate in an additional 4-h meal test on the last day of the 10-wk intervention. RESULTS: PAI-1 activity decreased after 10 wk of the LGI diet and was significantly different between groups. Changes in PAI-1 antigen followed the same trend, but no significant difference was observed between groups. No difference in plasma TIMP-1 concentrations was observed between groups. PAI-1 and TIMP-1 concentrations after the 4-h meal test were not significantly different between groups. CONCLUSION: An LGI diet reduces fasting plasma PAI-1 activity and therefore may be useful for diminishing the adverse cardiovascular effects of obesity. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00324090.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in women. Hyperlipidemia is a major risk factor for CVD, but research suggests that metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes are also key factors in CVD in postmenopausal women. Most dietary programs, however, focus only on hyperlipidemia and not on insulin resistance associated with diabetes and metabolic syndrome. This 12-wk trial compared the effects of a dietary program combining a low glycemic index diet with a functional food delivering 30 g of soy protein and 4 g of phytosterols per day (LGID) with a standard dietary program (American Heart Association Step 1 diet; AHAD) in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Fifty-nine postmenopausal women (average age 54.6 y, range 44-65 y) with a body mass index of 27 to 39 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to the LGID or the AHAD program for 12 wk. Total caloric intake and exercise were matched in each arm. RESULTS: Twenty-seven women completed the LGID program, and 26 completed the AHAD program. The participants on the LGID program showed statistically significant decreases in total cholesterol (15.8%, P = 0.0036 between-group comparison), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (14.8%, P = 0.004 between-group comparison), and triacylglycerol (44.8%, P = 0.006 between-group comparison). In addition, significant improvements were observed in ratios of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and of triacylglycerol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, and Framingham risk assessment for coronary heart disease compared with the AHAD program. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly greater improvement was observed in CVD risk factors in postmenopausal women on the LGID program (incorporating 30 g of soy protein and 4 g of phytosterols per day) than with a standard therapy.",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twelve type 2 diabetic men were randomly allocated to two periods of 4 weeks of an LGI or HGI carbohydrate diet separated by a 4-week washout interval, in a crossover design. RESULTS: The LGI diet induced lower postprandial plasma glucose and insulin profiles and areas under the curve than after the HGI diet. At the end of the two dietary periods, the 7-day dietary records demonstrated equal daily total energy and macronutrient intake. Body weight and total fat mass were comparable. Four-week LGI versus HGI diet induced improvement of fasting plasma glucose (P < 0.01, Delta changes during LGI vs. HGI), HbA(1c) (P < 0.01), and whole-body glucose utilization measured by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (P < 0.05). LGI diet induced a decrease in fasting plasma total and LDL cholesterol (Delta changes LGI vs. HGI, P < 0.01), free fatty acids (P < 0.01), apolipoprotein B, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 activity. CONCLUSIONS: Only 4 weeks of an LGI diet was able to improve glycemic control, glucose utilization, some lipid profiles, and the capacity for fibrinolysis in type 2 diabetes. Even if changes in glycemic control were modest during the 4-week period, the use of an LGI diet in a longer-term manner might play an important role in the treatment and prevention of diabetes and related disorders.",

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the long-term effects of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet with either low glycemic index (LGI) or high glycemic index (HGI) on ad libitum energy intake, body weight, and composition, as well as on risk factors for type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease in overweight healthy subjects. DESIGN: The study was a 10-wk parallel, randomized, intervention trial with 2 matched groups. The LGI or HGI test foods, given as replacements for the subjects' usual carbohydrate-rich foods, were equal in total energy, energy density, dietary fiber, and macronutrient composition. Subjects were 45 (LGI diet: n = 23; HGI diet: n = 22) healthy overweight [body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 27.6 +/- 0.2] women aged 20-40 y. RESULTS: Energy intake, mean (+/- SEM) body weight (LGI diet: -1.9 +/- 0.5 kg; HGI diet: -1.3 +/- 0.3 kg), and fat mass (LGI diet: -1.0 +/- 0.4 kg; HGI diet: -0.4 +/- 0.3 kg) decreased over time, but the differences between groups were not significant. No significant differences were observed between groups in fasting serum insulin, homeostasis model assessment for relative insulin resistance, homeostasis model assessment for beta cell function, triacylglycerol, nonesterified fatty acids, or HDL cholesterol. However, a 10% decrease in LDL cholesterol (P < 0.05) and a tendency to a larger decrease in total cholesterol (P = 0.06) were observed with consumption of the LGI diet as compared with the HGI diet. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support the contention that low-fat LGI diets are more beneficial than HGI diets with regard to appetite or body-weight regulation as evaluated over 10 wk. However, it confirms previous findings of a beneficial effect of LGI diets on risk factors for ischemic heart disease.",

Experimental evidence and specialty clinic trials suggest that a low glycemic index (LGI) diet could be an effective primary care-based treatment for overweight children. OBJECTIVE: Conduct a pilot study to determine whether parents of overweight children can lower the glycemic index (GI) of their child's diet after receiving brief instructions and a handout from their pediatrician; and the diet's impact on body mass index (BMI). PATIENTS: Children 5-12 years with BMIs greater than the 95th percentile. INTERVENTION: Brief description of the LGI diet and a handout categorizing foods based on their GI and sample meals. DESIGN: Nonrandomized, 12-week pilot study. MEASURES: BMI, 24-hour recall, and food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at entry; 3-day food records at 3, 6, and 9 weeks; BMI, FFQ, and questionnaire at 12 weeks. A GI score derived from standard GI tables. RESULTS: Of 34 children initially enrolled, 15 completed the study. Of these, 14 lowered their GI score (mean initial score = 26.6; mean score at 12 weeks 15.6; P <.0001). Mean daily carbohydrate (CHO) intake decreased by 73 g over the study period (P <.02), and mean daily caloric intake decreased by 292 kcal (P <.02). All 15 parents described the diet as easy to understand; 10 reported that their child was generally able to follow the diet. BMI Z-score decreased in 12 of 15 children. CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that implementing the LGI diet is feasible in primary care for some patients. Further study is warranted with larger study and comparison groups.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Conventional dietary approaches for the treatment of obesity have generally yielded disappointing results. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of a low-glycemic index (GI) diet compared with a standard reduced-fat diet in the management of pediatric obesity. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of children attending an outpatient pediatric obesity program from September 1997 to December 1998. SETTING: Academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred seven obese but otherwise healthy children. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in body mass index (BMI [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters]) and body weight from first to last clinic visit. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients received the low glycemic index diet and 43 received the reduced-fat diet for 4.3 vs 4.2 months' mean duration of follow-up, with 3.3 vs 3.3 mean number of visits, respectively. Body mass index (-1.53 kg/m(2) [95% confidence interval, -1.94 to -1.12] vs -0.06 kg/m(2) [-0.56 to + 0. 44], P<.001) and body weight (-2.03 kg [95% confidence interval -3. 19 to -0.88] vs +1.31 kg [ -0.11 to + 2.72], P<.001) decreased more in the low-GI group compared with the reduced-fat group. In multivariate models, these differences remained significant (P<.01) after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, BMI or baseline weight, participation in behavioral modification sessions, and treatment duration. Significantly more patients in the low-GI group experienced a decrease in BMI of at least 3 kg/m(2) (11 kg/m(2) [17. 2%] vs. 1 kg/m(2) [2.3%], P =.03). CONCLUSIONS: A low-GI diet seems to be a promising alternative to standard dietary treatment for obesity in children. Long-term randomized controlled trials of a low-GI diet in the prevention and treatment of obesity are needed.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of varying the glycemic index (GI) of carbohydrate-rich foods on metabolic control in type 2 diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a randomized crossover study, 20 patients, 5 women and 15 men, were given preweighed diets with different GIs during two consecutive 24-day periods. Both diets were composed in accordance with dietary recommendations for people with diabetes. The macronutrient composition and type and amount of dietary fiber were identical. Differences in GI were achieved mainly by altering the structure of the starchy foods. RESULTS: Peripheral insulin sensitivity increased significantly and fasting plasma glucose decreased during both treatment periods. There was a significant difference in the changes of serum fructosamine concentrations between the diets (P < 0.05). The incremental area under the curve for both blood glucose and plasma insulin was approximately 30% lower after the low- than after the high-GI diet. LDL cholesterol was significantly lowered on both diets, with a significantly more pronounced reduction on the low-GI diet. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity was normalized on the low-GI diet, (-54%, P < 0.001), but remained unchanged on the high-GI diet. CONCLUSIONS: A diet characterized by low-GI starchy foods lowers the glucose and insulin responses throughout the day and improves the lipid profile and capacity for fibrinolysis, suggesting a therapeutic potential in diabetes.",
