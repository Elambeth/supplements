      "abstract": "Stable angina pectoris (SAP) is a prevalent manifestation of ischemic heart disease, characterized by chest pain due to myocardial ischemia. Although standard pharmacological treatments such as nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers are commonly prescribed, their long-term efficacy is often limited by side effects, prompting interest in alternative therapies. Compound Danshen droplet Pills (CDDP), a traditional Chinese medicine formulation comprising Salvia miltiorrhiza, Panax notoginseng, and Borneol, has been widely used in China for its cardiovascular benefits, including improving circulation and alleviating angina symptoms. Despite its clinical use, systematic evaluations of CDDP's efficacy in SAP management are limited. This review summarizes the clinical evidence on CDDP for SAP treatment by analyzing randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A comprehensive search of the China National Knowledge Infrastructure and PubMed databases was conducted, covering studies up to July 31, 2024, using terms such as \"compound Danshen droplet pills\" and \"stable angina pectoris.\" Only peer-reviewed RCTs focusing on CDDP for SAP, published in English or Chinese, were included. After a rigorous screening process by 2 independent authors, with discrepancies resolved by a third, 10 eligible RCTs were selected for review. The results suggest that CDDP may provide significant therapeutic benefits, including anti-ischemic, vasodilatory, and antioxidative effects, with favorable safety profiles in both monotherapy and combination therapy. However, further multicenter RCTs are necessary to validate its long-term efficacy and safety. This review highlights the potential of CDDP as a complementary therapy for SAP and underscores the need for further evidence-based research to optimize its clinical use.",

      "abstract": "Danshen, a well-known traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has gained increasing attention for its protective effects on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be elucidated. Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), a key transporter mediating intestinal cholesterol absorption, has emerged as a critical target for NAFLD treatment. This study aimed to screen for NPC1L1 inhibitors from Danshen and investigate their therapeutic effects on NAFLD. We established a high-throughput screening platform using stable Caco2 cell lines expressing human NPC1L1 (hL1-Caco2) and discovered that tanshinones (Tans), the liposoluble components of Danshen, inhibited NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol absorption in hL1-Caco2 cells. Additionally, Tans treatment reduced hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. To identify the active compounds in Tans, activity-oriented separation was performed by integrating the high-throughput screening platform and two-dimensional chromatographic techniques. Ultimately, cryptotanshinone (CTS) was identified as a novel NPC1L1 inhibitor and significantly decreased hepatic steatosis in HFD-fed mice. Molecular docking and dynamics simulation showed that CTS stably bound with NPC1L1, where TRP383 acted as the key amino acid. Taken together, this study demonstrates, for the first time, that CTS, a liposoluble compound from Danshen, is a novel NPC1L1 inhibitor. Our findings suggest that the inhibitory effect of CTS against NPC1L1-mediated intestinal cholesterol absorption may be a potential mechanism, contributing to its alleviation of NAFLD in mice.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of Guanxin Danshen dropping pills (GDDP) for treating angina pectoris (AP) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating GDDP for AP in CHD patients were systematically screened from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China Biology Medicine disc (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), and WanFang databases from database inception to March 2023. Bias assessment followed the Cochrane Manual 5.1 criteira, and data analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3. RESULTS: Twenty articles were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to standard therapy, GDDP exhibited a superior efficacy in treating AP (P < 0.01), significantly improved electrocardiogram (ECG) outcomes in AP patients (P < 0.00001), reduced frequency of AP episodes (P < 0.01), lowered incidence of cardiovascular events in AP patients (P = 0.01) and significantly elevated hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) levels (all P < 0.01). However, it did not significantly affect the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), or matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) (all P > 0.05). GDDP also reduced total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (all P < 0.01) as well as whole blood viscosity (WBV), plasma viscosity, fibrinogen and hematocrit levels (all P < 0.01). Additionally, the combination of GDDP and conventional CHD treatment was found to be safe. CONCLUSION: Combining GDDP with conventional western medicine was more effective than either treatment alone in reducing cardiovascular events, alleviating angina symptoms, improving inflammation, and optimizing hemorheological parameters, without increasing side effects. These findings underscore GDDP's use as a complementary treatment for CHD."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Guanxin II, proposed by Chen Keji (National master of traditional Chinese medicine), possesses neuroprotective effect. Interestingly, its simplified prescription Danshen-Chuanxiong-Honghua (DCH) can also clinically ameliorate cerebral impairment and improve spatial cognitive deficits, similar to the function of original formula. AIM OF THE STUDY: We aimed to elucidate the rationality of DCH's natural existence, qualitatively identify DCH-derived phytochemicals, thereby to validate cerebral protective effect, and expose the potential mechanism of DCH and its main absorbed compound ferulic acid (FA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The natural rationality of DCH's existence for treating TBI was verified using data mining. The qualitative analysis of DCH extract-derived phytochemicals was conducted through liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Controlled cortical impact (CCI) was chosen to establish TBI model. Neurological behavior tests, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability test, brain water content measurement, and proinflammatory factors consisting of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α of plasma, and HPA axis-related hormone levels of DA, NA, 5-HT, ghrelin, and BDNF in hippocampus were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Network pharmacology was employed to predict potential targets and pathways of DCH intervening TBI. Growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) antagonist [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 (D-Lys3) was injected intraperitoneally in TBI rats after waking up. Molecular docking and pharmacological experiment with D-Lys3 were used to verify the pathway. RESULTS: Twenty-six phytochemicals were identified based on LC-MS. FA, as the primary contributor of DCH, alleviated disruption of BBB and reduced brain edema, suppressed the secretion of proinflammatory factors, such as IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, as well as HPA axis-related hormones such as DA, NA, and 5-HT, and ghrelin, and BDNF by regulating the Ghrelin/GHSR pathway. These results were validated by GHSR receptor antagonist, as well as molecule docking. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, DCH, when prescribed for the treatment of TBI, has a certain degree of reasonableness. FA, as the main absorbed component, demonstrated a similar function to DCH in improving the blood-brain barrier, promoting neural recovery, and anti-inflammatory effects in TBI rats, primarily via modulating Ghrelin/GHSR.",

This study presented a comprehensive chemical analysis of GD using an advanced analytical platform, which integrated online two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC × LC) coupled with diode array detector (DAD) and hybrid linear ion trap orbitrap mass spectrometry (LTQ-orbitrap). In this setup, a Hypersil GOLD CN column (150 mm × 2.1 mm, 3 µm) was employed in the first dimension, while an Accucore PFP column (50 mm × 4.6 mm, 2.6 µm) was used in the second dimension. Under optimized conditions, the online LC × LC-DAD-ESI/HRMS/MSn system exhibited high orthogonality (90.20%) and 102 compounds were identified or tentatively characterized based on high-resolution accurate mass and MSn fragmentation data, acquired in both positive and negative ion modes. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis method was developed and validated using LC × LC-DAD contour plots, targeting 26 bioactive components in GD herb pair. This method demonstrated excellent linearity (R2 ≥ 0.9970) and precision with relative standard deviation (RSD) values below 4.95%. The established analytical approach offers robust separation, reliable identification, and precise quantification of chemical constituents in GD herb pair, providing a valuable tool for the study of bioactive compounds in complex herbal matrices.",

This study aims to investigate the efficacy and preliminary mechanism by which FFDS may impact the progression of SCHD. METHODS: Based on randomization, we administered oral FFDS to 30 patients with SCHD in addition to conventional treatment for 30 days. After treatment, three-months major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were assessed as the primary outcome. Additionally, we evaluated the patients' Seattle Angina Questionnaire score, blood pressure, circulating levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, platelets, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, serum creatinine, and fasting blood glucose as the secondary outcomes. Furthermore, we utilized mass spectrometry analysis, network pharmacology, and lipidomics to predict the potential mechanisms of FFDS in the treatment of SCHD. RESULTS: Following treatment, FFDS demonstrated significant improvements in serum triglyceride levels (P = 0.013) and a reduction in the frequency of angina episodes (P = 0.021). We conducted mass spectrometry analysis on FFDS and identified 236 chemical components. Lipidomics further confirmed triglycerides as key lipids affected by FFDS. By integrating these findings with network pharmacology targets, we highlighted the potential roles of LPL, CD36, FABPpm, L-FABP, LCAT, and CEPT in fat digestion, absorption, and metabolism pathways, suggesting their involvement in FFDS's treatment of SCHD by reducing triglycerides. CONCLUSION: In individuals with SCHD, the administration of FFDS has been shown to effectively reduce circulating triglyceride levels and decrease the frequency of angina episodes. This therapeutic effect is likely due to the active components of FFDS targeting key proteins: LPL, CD36, FABPpm, L-FABP, LCAT, and CEPT.

The study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of Lutai Danshen Baishao Granules (LDBG) in alleviating melasma and to compare the effects of LDBG in patients with and without kidney-deficiency and blood-stasis syndrome through a real-world, large-sample investigation. METHODS: A multicenter, prospective, nonrandomized, observational trial was conducted from December 2021 to May 2023, recruiting 1000 female participants with melasma. After enrollment, participants were divided into Group A (kidney-deficiency and blood-stasis syndrome) and group B (non-kidney-deficiency and blood-stasis syndrome) based on the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome scale. General physical signs, melasma indicators, Dermatology Life Quality Index, and TCM syndrome scores were recorded before and after the intervention. The long-term effectiveness was assessed 2 months after the intervention ended. RESULTS: Following the intervention, melasma-related indicators and TCM syndrome scores were significantly lower than those before the intervention (P < .001). Compared to Group B, Group A showed a more significant reduction in the total area of melasma and the Melasma Area and Severity Index score (P < .05). The reduction in melasma area was also more pronounced in Group A (group A: 425.00 vs group B: 312.50, P < .001). Two months after the intervention, intergroup and intragroup comparisons revealed that LDBG had a long-term effect with a lower tendency for recurrence, and the long-term effect in Group A was better than in group B (P < .05). The overall incidence of adverse events during the trial was 1.2%. CONCLUSION: LDBG can reduce facial melasma and improve TCM syndromes, particularly in cases of melasma associated with kidney-deficiency and blood-stasis syndrome, with high safety and low risk of relapse.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The pathogenesis of renal fibrosis is related to blood stasis, and the method of promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis is often used as the treatment principle. Danshen injection (DSI) is a commonly used drug for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis in clinic. However, whether DSI slows the progression of renal fibrosis or the potential mechanism is uncertain. METHODS: We investigated renal fibrosis models using UUO mice and TGF-β stimulation in HK-2 cells. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that DSI or Fer-1 alleviated kidney injury by ameliorating renal morphology injury and pathological injury in vivo. Besides, DSI or Fer-1 inhibited renal fibrosis in vivo and in TGF-β-induced HK-2 cells. Furthermore, ferroptosis was lessened under DSI or Fer-1 treatment. More importantly, the DSI active ingredients (danshensu, salvianolic acid B, protocatechuic aldehyde, caffeic acid and tanshinone IIA) could bind to SIRT1. The protein levels of SIRT1 and GPX4 were downregulated accompanied by the incremental concentrations of TGF-β or Erastin, which were repaired by DSI or Fer-1 intervention. However, the inhibition of ferroptosis and renal fibrosis owing to DSI were reversed by SIRT1 inhibitor EX527. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results indicated that DSI could protect against ferroptosis to attenuate renal fibrosis by activating the SIRT1/GPX4 pathway. It is expected to be a potential agent to treat renal fibrosis."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Huangqi-Danshen decoction (HDD) is composed of Huangqi (Astragali Radix) and Danshen (Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma) and has been shown to alleviate renal fibrosis. However, the potential therapeutic mechanisms and effective components of HDD remain unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: Both lipid metabolism and cGAS/STING signaling play vital roles in the development and progression of renal fibrosis. However, their relationship in renal fibrosis is largely unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the antifibrotic mechanisms of HDD from the perspective of lipid remodeling and cGAS/STING signaling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo, renal fibrosis was induced by feeding male C57BL/6 mice with 0.2% adenine-diet for 28 consecutive days. The treatment groups were orally administered HDD at low, medium, and high doses of 3.4 g/kg/d, 6.8 g/kg/d, and 13.6 g/kg/d simultaneously with modeling. Renal function was evaluated by the serum levels of urea nitrogen and creatinine, pathological changes of renal tissue were evaluated by Periodic acid-Schiff and Masson's trichrome staining, and renal lipid metabolites were analyzed by lipidomics. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence were used to detect the expressions of fibrosis-related proteins, SCD1, and cGAS/STING signaling-related proteins in renal tissue. In vitro, mouse primary proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) were treated with transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) or stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) inhibitor A939572. Additionally, UHPLC-QE-MS analysis and TCMSP database were used to screen the effective components of HDD, and the action mechanisms of these components were verified in mouse primary PTECs. RESULTS: HDD dose-dependently improved renal function, pathological injury, and fibrosis in adenine-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD) mice model. Moreover, cGAS/STING signaling was significantly activated in fibrotic kidney and was suppressed by HDD treatment. In renal lipidomics analysis, 521 and 138 differential lipids were identified in control vs. CKD and CKD vs. CKD + HDD, respectively. Of note, lipids increased in fibrotic kidneys were more saturated (fewer double bonds), whereas lipids increased by HDD were less saturated (more double bonds). Further, SCD1 expression was significantly down-regulated in fibrotic kidney and could be restored by HDD treatment. The expression of SCD1 was also down-regulated in Ju CKD patients' dataset and TGF-β1-induced fibrogenic responses in mouse primary PTECs. Mechanistically, specific inhibition of SCD1 expression could activate cGAS/STING signaling in primary PTECs. In addition, three components of HDD (isoimperatorin, baicalin, and miltirone) were screened out. Furthermore, administration of these three components, especially isoimperatorin and miltirone, counteracted the activation of cGAS/STING signaling induced by SCD1 pharmacological inhibition. CONCLUSION: HDD could alleviate renal fibrosis, which may be related to the regulation of cGAS/STING signaling through targeting SCD1.",

      "abstract": "The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Compound Danshen Dripping Pills (CDDP) in improving cardiac function among patients with acute anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (AAMI). Between February 2021 and February 2023, 247 eligible patients with AAMI after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) were enrolled and randomly assigned (1∶1) to receive CDDP ( n = 126) or placebo ( n = 121), with a follow-up of 48 weeks. Compared with the placebo group, the CDDP group demonstrated a significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) values after 24 weeks of the treatment (least squares mean: 3.31; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.72-4.90; P < 0.001) and at the 48-week follow-up (least squares mean: 4.35; 95% CI: 2.76-5.94; P < 0.001). Significant reductions of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were observed in both groups at the 24- and 48-week visits without difference between the two groups ( P > 0.1 for all), and 6.35% and 5.79% of patients in the CDDP and placebo groups experienced major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, respectively ( P = 0.822). Therefore, no serious adverse events were attributed to CDDP. These findings sugget that CDDP was well tolerated and improved LVEF of patients with AAMI in 24 and 48 weeks."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Danshen [Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Lamiaceae; Salviae miltiorrhizae radix et rhizoma)] class injections (DSCIs) are widely used in the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, there are various types of DSCIs available on the market, and it remains uncertain which DSCI has the best clinical efficacy, as well as which one is most effective in regulating inflammatory markers and oxidative stress indicators. The aim of this network meta-analysis (NMA) is to compare the therapeutic effects of different DSCIs to identify the optimal DSCI for the treatment of CHD. METHODS: The databases searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of DSCIs for CHD included the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The search period spanned from the inception of each database up to June 2024. NMA was conducted using RevMan 5.3 and Stata 16.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 106 studies including 14,979 patients, involving 10,931 patients, with 5,640 in the experimental group and 5,291 in the control group. And ten DSCIs were extracted, namely: Danhong injection (DH), Danshen injection (DS), Danshenchuanxiongqin injection (DSCXQ), Dansenduofensuanyan injection (DSDFSY), Danshenfen injection (DSFZ), Fufang Danshen injection (FFDS), Guanxinning injection (GXN), Sodium Tanshinone IIA Sulfonate injection (STS), Xiangdan injection (XD), Shenxiongputaotang injection (SXPTT). The results of NMA showed that, XD injection significantly enhances clinical efficacy; STS is more effective in reducing hs-CRP levels; DSDFSY shows better efficacy in decreasing IL-1 and increasing NO levels; DSCXQ has a greater advantage in reducing IL-6 levels; GXN is more effective in regulating SOD levels; and DH is better at reducing MDA levels. CONCLUSION: The combined treatment of DSCIs and WM more significant efficacy in patients with CHD compared to WM treatment alone, including clinical efficacy evaluation, inflammatory markers, and oxidative stress markers. Overall, DSDFSY and DSCXQ show better performance in clinical efficacy evaluation and regulation of inflammatory markers, while DH exhibits a more stable effect in regulating oxidative stress. However, larger sample sizes and high-quality RCTs are still necessary to further compare the various DSCIs. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: [PROSPERO], identifier [CRD42024548928]."

METHODS: HMrSV5 cells cultured in 40% peritoneal dialysis solution for 72 h to induce EndMT were treated with 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.5% Danshen Injection. CCK-8 assay was used to assess the changes in viability of the treated cells, and the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the cell supernatant were detected using ELISA; Western blotting was performed to detect the protein expressions of E-cadherin, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), p-Smad 2/3, and Smad 7 in the cells. RESULTS: Culture in 40% peritoneal dialysis fluid for 72 induced significant EndMT in HMrSV5 cells, which exhibited obviously lowered cell viability. Danshen Injection within the concentration range of 0.025%-1.5% did not significantly affect the viability of the cells. Exposure of HMrSV5 cells to peritoneal dialysis fluid for 72 h significantly increased the production of IL-6, TNF‑α, TGF‑β and VEGF, upregulated the protein expressions of α‑SMA and p-Smad 2/3, and lowered the expressions of E-cadherin and Smad7 proteins. Treatment of the exposed cells with Danshen injection significantly increased cell viability and cellular expressions of E-cadherin and Smad 7 proteins and reduced the production of IL-6, TNF-α, TGF-β and VEGF and the protein expressions of α‑SMA and p-Smad 2/3. CONCLUSIONS: Danshen Injection can suppress peritoneal dialysis fluid-induced EndMT in HMrSV5 cells possibly by regulating the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway.",

METHODS: The PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Biomedical Literature Service System, Chinese Medical Journal Database, and Wan Fang MED databases were searched from inception to November 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies were included. The primary outcomes were angina symptom and electrocardiography (ECG) efficacy, angina symptom efficacy, and ECG efficacy. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO No. CRD42022314774. RESULTS: Our study included 7 245 patients with angina (59 RCTs, 11 cohort studies). When ISMN was combined with CDDP, the efficacy of angina symptom and ECG [odds ratio (OR) = 4.824, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.636-6.401, P = 0.000], the efficacy of angina symptom (OR = 4.347, 95% CI = 3.635-5.198, P = 0.000), the efficacy of ECG (OR = 3.364, 95% CI = 2.767-4.089, P = 0.000) were better than that of patients treated with ISMN alone.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) derived exosomes have demonstrated potential therapeutic efficacy on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MI/RI). This study has explored the underlying mechanisms of Danshen decoction (DSD) pretreated BMSCs-exosomes to treat MI/RI in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: Extracellular vesicles extracted from BMSCs were identified, miRNA sequencing was performed to screen the effects of DSD, and verified to target TXNIP in vivo. After MI/RI modeling, rats were treated with BMSCs-exosomes pretreated with DSD or miRNA inhibitor. BMSCs-exosomes, DSD-pretreated BMSCs-exosomes, and miRNA inhibitor/anti-miRNA-pretreated BMSCs-exosomes were used to treat H9c2 cells or MI/RI rats. CCK-8, Tunnel staining, and flow cytometry were performed to measure cell viability. LDH, CK, CK-MB were detected to evaluate cell injury. MDA, SOD, and ROS were used to confirm oxidative stress. Furthermore, IL-1β, IL-18, cleaved-caspase-1, pro-caspase-1, NLRP3, TXNIP, and GSDMD were quantified for the TXNIP/NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling activation. In addition, echocardiography was used to observe the heart function, and H&E stain was performed to detect pathological injury. RESULTS: Following DSD pretreatment, there was a marked elevation in the expression levels of miR-93-5p, miR-16-5p, and miR-15b-5p, with miR-93-5p exhibiting the highest baseMean value. The administration of a miR-93-5p inhibitor yielded effects counteractive to those observed with DSD treatment, leading to reduced cell proliferation, heightened oxidative stress (as indicated by increased levels of SOD and ROS, alongside a decrease in MDA), and enhanced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, DSD effectively mitigated the miR-93-5p-induced upregulation of key inflammatory and apoptotic markers, including IL-1β, IL-18, caspase-1, NLRP3, TXNIP, and GSDMD. Notably, exosomes derived from DSD-pretreated BMSCs demonstrated a capacity to alleviate cardiac damage. CONCLUSION: DSD may target miR-93-5p within BMSC-derived exosomes to confer protection against cardiac damage by inhibiting the activation of the TXNIP/NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling pathway, thereby mitigating cardiomyocyte pyroptosis. This study provides a theoretical foundation for the application of DSD in the treatment of MI/RI.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Huangqi-Danshen decoction (HDD) is a classic traditional Chinese medicine for treating heart failure. Pericardial adipose tissue (PAT) has recently gained increasing attention in cardiovascular diseases. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of pericardial adipose tissue-derived extracellular vesicles on heart failure, the protective effect of HDD on myocardial remodel in heart failure rats, and identify the potential molecular mechanisms involved. METHODS: UPLC-MS/MS identified active components of HDD. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from pericardial adipose tissue of sham-operated and HF rats were identified through transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis and western blot. EVs were co-cultured with H9c2 cardiomyocytes in order to examine their uptake and effects. MicroRNA sequencing, dual-luciferase reporter assay and PCR were conducted for exploring specific mechanisms of EVs on hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. In vivo, heart failure was modeled in rats via transverse aortic constriction (TAC). In vitro, the hypertrophic cardiomyocyte model were established using Ang II-induced H9c2 cardiomyocytes. RESULTS: UPLC-MS/MS identified 11 active components in serum of HDD administrated rats. Echocardiography showed HDD improved cardiac function in TAC model rats. HE and Masson staining indicated HDD ameliorated myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis. MicroRNA sequencing found that HDD treatment resulted in 37 differentially expressed miRNAs (DMEs) (p < 0.05 and |log2FC| ≥ 1). KEGG analysis revealed that DEMs were enriched in the AMPK signaling pathway. PCR identified miR-27a-3p with the greatest difference in AMPK-related DMEs. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and Targetscan website were utilized to identify the target relationship between miR-27a-3p and PRKAA2 (AMPKα2). The miR-27a-3p negatively regulated AMPKα2 to inhibit mitophagy mediated by PINK1/Parkin pathway. HDD inhibited miR-27a-3p secretion from failing heart pericardial adipose tissue-derived extracellular vesicles, thereby improving inflammation, cardiac function, and myocardial remodeling through above pathways. CONCLUSION: HDD inhibited the PAT-derived extracellular vesicular miR-27a-3p in failing hearts to activate AMPK/PINK1/Parkin signaling-mediated mitophagy, which improved cardiomyocyte energy metabolism, myocardial remodeling and heart failure.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To employee network pharmacology to predict the components and pathways of SanQi-DanShen (SQDS) in treating coronary heart disease, followed by in vitro experiments to validate the molecular mechanism of SQDS in treating coronary heart disease. METHODS: We sourced the active ingredients and targets of Panax notoginseng and Danshen from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database. Coronary heart disease related genes were retrieved from the OMIM, Genecards, and Therapeutic Target databases. Using Cytoscape 3.7.2 software, we constructed a network diagram illustrating the components and targets of SQDS. The associated targets were then imported into the STRING database to build a protein-protein interaction network. The Metascape database and WeChat software were utilized for Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses. Lastly, we performed molecular docking between the key components and related targets using AutoDock Vina. To validate the potential mechanism of SQDS in treating coronary heart disease, we established an acute coronary heart disease rat model via tail vein injection of pituitrin. RESULTS: Network pharmacology analysis revealed that 65 active ingredients and 167 targets of SQDS are implicated in the treatment of coronary heart disease. The key targets identified include AKT1, TNF, TP53, IL6, and VEGFA. Notably, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway emerged as the primary pathway. Furthermore, animal experiments showed that, compared to the model group, SQDS significantly reduced levels of TNF-α, IL-6, Bax, and cardiac troponin I, while increasing Bcl-2 content. It also notably suppressed the expression of p-PI3K and p-AKT, thereby offering protection to myocardial tissue. CONCLUSION: Through the integrated approach of network pharmacology and molecular docking, we have established that SQDS exerts a multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway synergistic therapeutic effect on coronary heart disease. Its mechanism may involve the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and the reduction of inflammatory factor expression.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As a traditional Chinese medicine, Danshen shows potential efficacy for treating ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the bioactive components and mode of action were unclear. AIM OF THIS STUDY: This paper uses a combination of network pharmacology, serum medicinal chemistry, and gene expression profiling to clarify its possible molecular mechanism of action and material basis. METHODS: Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) was utilized to analyze the herbal components and metabolites from the serum of Danshen-treated mice. Gene expression profiles were applied to construct a database of Danshen action targets. Then, active ingredient-target-biological functional module networks were constructed to analyze the mechanism of action. Molecular docking has further confirmed the possibility of its components to the targets. RESULTS: As a result, 193 common targets between 1684 Danshen-related DEGs and 1492 UC targets were determined as the potential targets for Danshen in treatment with UC. Serum pharmacochemistry and target prediction showed that 22 components in serum acted on 777 targets. Intersection with common targets yielded 46 core targets, and an active ingredienttarget- biological functional module network was constructed for analysis. Network prediction and molecular docking results showed that the main action modules were inflammatory response and cell apoptosis, which mainly acted on targets SRC, RELA, HSP90AA1, CTNNB1, STAT3, and CASP3. The main components of Danshen intervention in UC were predicted to include Catechol, 3,9-Dimethoxypterocarpan, 8-Prenylnaringenin, Isoferulic acid, Salvianolic acid C, and Danshensu. CONCLUSION: The present study provides a scientific foundation for further explicating the mechanisms of Danshen against UC."

      "abstract": "When plants are subjected to mechanical wounding(MW)caused by insect feeding, extreme weather, and human factors, they rapidly initiate a series of response mechanisms at the transcriptional and metabolic levels, leading to changes in the content of phytohormone and secondary metabolites in plants. In this study, using the medicinal model plant Danshen(Salvia miltiorrhiza) as an example, the effect of MW on the metabolism of medicinal plants was evaluated. By virtue of qRT-PCR and LC-MS, the changes in the biosynthetic genes and contents of jasmonates(JAs) and tanshinones in response to leaf damage stimulation were detected to reveal the related patterns of transcription and metabolism in leaves and roots at different time points after MW treatment, thus exploring the response mechanism of Danshen to MW stress. The results showed that MW induction could transiently increase the expression of biosynthetic genes of Jas, with AOC and JAR beginning to increase and peaking at 2 h after induction, while AOS and OPR3 peaked at 4 h. Correspondingly, the content of OPDA, JA, and JA-Ile all peaked at 2 h. In the biosynthesis of tanshinones, the diterpene synthase genes CPS1 and KSL1 both peaked at 2 h, while the subsequent modification genes CYP450s all peaked at 4 h. The content of the four tanshinones showed a continuous increase trend within 8 h. This study provides a reference for revealing the research on secondary metabolite accumulation under MW stress and lays a foundation for further understanding the role of Jas in enhancing plant resistance, promoting the accumulation of active ingredients, and improving the quality of medicinal materials under MW stress.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Danshen-Shanzha Decoction (DSD) is a renowned herbal combination consisting of the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (known as Danshen in Chinese) and the fruits of Crataegus pinnatifida Bunge (known as Shanzha in Chinese), which has exhibited remarkable clinical efficacy in the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD) in traditional Chinese medicine, with its earliest recorded application dating to around 202 BCE during the Han Dynasty. Despite significant advancements in the fundamental research and clinical applications of DSD over the past few decades, the precise bioactive components as well as the underlying mechanisms responsible for its protective effect on CHD remain unelucidated. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was designed to elucidate the bioactive components and potential mechanism of DSD in the treatment of CHD using in silico technologies integrated with pharmacoinformatic methods and experimental validation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemical components of DSD were analyzed and identified using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. Pharmacoinformatic-based methods were employed to comprehensively investigate the principal active components and targets of DSD for treating CHD. GO and KEGG pathway analyses were utilized to elucidate the underlying mechanism responsible for DSD's efficacy against CHD. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation were performed to assess the binding affinity between active components and putative targets. Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was carried out to verify the affinity and kinetic characteristics of major components to STAT3 protein. Subsequently, a series of in vitro experiments, including cell viability test, flow cytometric analysis, ELISA and western blotting, were conducted to validate the predicted results in an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-stimulated H9c2 model. RESULTS: A total of 96 compounds were characterized by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, and 281 overlapping targets were identified through pharmacoinformatic-based methods. Among these, ten critical compounds were determined as the core active components of DSD. The core targets associated with the development of CHD included STAT3, SRC, TP53, JUN, and AKT1. Notably, Dihydrotanshinone I and (+)-Epicatechin exhibited strong binding affinity towards STAT3. The potential mechanisms by which DSD modulates the pathological progression of CHD were predicted to involve inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Importantly, the cytoprotective effect of DSD against apoptosis was confirmed in OGD-stimulated H9c2 cells, as evidenced by the upregulation of Bcl-2 expression and downregulation of both Bax and cleaved caspase-3 expressions upon DSD treatment. Furthermore, DSD significantly enhanced the phosphorylated protein expressions of JAK2 and STAT3 compared to the OGD group, suggesting its potential role in modulating related signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The current study successfully fills the gap in the understanding of the chemical profiles of DSD, predicting its active components, potential targets, and molecular mechanisms in the treatment of CHD. These findings not only provide a valuable strategy but also robust data support for future investigations into DSD, thereby facilitating the identification of novel therapeutic targets for traditional Chinese medicines in the battle against CHD.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hypercholesterolemia (HLC) was a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) characterized by elevated cholesterol levels, particularly LDL. While traditional Chinese medicine preparations Compound Danshen Pills(CDP) has been clinically used for hypercholesterolemia and coronary heart disease, its specific therapeutic effect on HLC remains understudied, necessitating further investigation into its mechanisms. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to explore the potential of CDP in treating HLC and elucidate its underlying mechanisms and active components. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hypercholesterolemic lipemia rat model induced by a high-fat diet was employed. Network pharmacology combined with UHPLC-Q exactive orbitrap HRMS technique was used to predict the active components, targets and mechanisms of CDP for HLC. Histological analysis and serum biochemical assays were used to assess the therapeutic effect of CDP and its main active ingredient Sa B on hypercholesterolemic lipemia rat model. Immunofluorescence assays and western blotting were used to verify the mechanism of CDP and Sa B in the treatment of HLC. Metabolomics approach was used to demonstrate that CDP and Sa B affected the metabolic profile of HLC. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that both CDP and its main active ingredient Sa B significantly ameliorated hypercholesterolemic lipemic lesions, reducing levels of TC, LDL, AST, ALT, and ALP. Histological analysis revealed a decrease in lipid droplet accumulation and collagen fiber deposition in the liver, as well as reduced collagen fiber deposition in the aorta. Network pharmacology predicted potential targets such as PPARα and CYP27A1. Immunofluorescence assays and western blotting confirmed that CDP and Sa B upregulated the expression of Adipor1, PPARα and CYP27A1. Metabolomics analyses further indicated improvements in ABC transporters metabolic pathways, with differential metabolites such as riboflavin, taurine, and choline showed regression in levels after CDP treatment and riboflavin, L-Threonine, Thiamine, L-Leucine, and Adenosine showed improved expression after Sa B treatment. CONCLUSION: CDP and Sa B have been shown to alleviate high-fat diet-induced hypercholesterolemia by activating the PPAR pathway and improving hepatic lipid metabolism. Our study demonstrated, for the first time, the complex mechanism of CDP, Sa B in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia at the protein and metabolic levels and provided a new reference that could elucidate the pharmacological effects of traditional Chinese medicine on hypercholesterolemia from multiple perspectives.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen, DS) and Radix Paeoniae Rubra (Chishao, CS) herbal pair (DS-CS) is a famous traditional Chinese combination which has been used as antithrombotic formular for centuries. However, there is still lack of sufficient scientific evidence to illustrate its underlying mechanisms. The purpose of this study is to investigate the antithrombotic effects of DS-CS extract in zebrafish and explore its possible mechanism of action. METHODS: The quality of traditional Chinese medicines DS and CS granules was evaluated using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Subsequently, the therapeutic effect of the DS-CS combination and its components, Salvianolic Acid A (SAA) and Paeoniflorin (PF), in various concentrations on thrombosis was experimentally validated. Moreover, the interaction between DS-CS and the thrombosis disease targets was analyzed through network pharmacology, predicting the potential antithrombotic mechanism of DS-CS. Molecular docking and in vivo zebrafish experiments were conducted to validate the predicted targets, with qRT-PCR utilized for target validation. RESULTS: DS-CS exhibited anti-thrombotic effect in zebrafish with concentrations ranging from 25 to 300 μg/mL. The co-administration of PF and SAA at 25 μg/mL each revealed a synergistic antithrombotic effect exceeding that of individual components when contrasted with PHZ treatment. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis identified key genes, including Albumin (ALB), Proto-oncogene tyro-sine-protein kinase Src (SRC), Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), Caspase-3 (CASP3), Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (KDR), Matrix metalloprotein-ase-2(MMP2), Thrombin (F2), and Coagulation factor Xa (F10), associated with the antithrombotic action of PF and SAA. Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis indicated involvement of lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis pathways. Molecular docking revealed strong binding of PF and SAA to pivotal hub genes, such as SRC, EGFR, and F10. The experimental findings demonstrated that DS-CS could upregulate the mRNA expression levels of EGFR while inhibiting F10 and SRC mRNA levels, thereby ameliorating thrombotic conditions. CONCLUSION: This research provided valuable insights into the potential mechanisms underlying the antithrombotic activity of DS-CS. Our findings suggested that PF and SAA could be the key active ingredients responsible for this activity. The antithrombotic effects of DS-CS appeared to be mediated through the regulation of mRNA expression of SRC, EGFR, and F10. These results enhanced our understanding of DS-CS's therapeutic potential and lay the groundwork for future studies to further elucidate its mechanisms of action."

      "abstract": "Danshen-Shanzha Formula (DSF) is a well-known herbal combination comprising Radix Salvia Miltiorrhiza (known as Danshen in Chinese) and Fructus Crataegi (known as Shanzha in Chinese), It has been documented to exhibit considerable benefits for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis, and was used extensively in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiac and cerebral vascular diseases over decades. Despite several breakthroughs achieved in the basic research and clinical applications of DSF over the past decades, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews summarizing its features and research, which hinders further exploration and exploitation of this promising formula. This review aims to provide a comprehensive interpretation of DSF in terms of its ethnopharmacological relevance, preparation methods, chemical constituents, pharmacokinetic properties and pharmacological effects. The related information on Danshen, Shanzha, and DSF was obtained from internationally recognized online scientific databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Baidu Scholar, ScienceDirect, ACS Publications, Online Library, Wan Fang Database as well as Flora of China. Data were also gathered from documentations, printed works and classics, such as the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, Chinese herbal classics, etc. Three essential avenues for future studies were put forward as follows: a) Develop and unify the standard preparation method of DSF as to achieve optimized pharmacological properties. b) Elucidate the functional mechanisms as well as the rationality and rule for the compatibility art of DSF by focusing on the clinic syndromes together with the subsequent development of preclinic study system in vitro and in vivo with consistent pathological features, pharmacokinetical behaviour and biomarkers. c) Perform more extensive clinical studies towards the advancement of mechanism-based on evidence-based medicine on the safety application of DSF. This review will provide substantial data support and broader perspective for further research on the renowned formula."

      "abstract": "Purpose: Current pharmacological treatments for Ulcerative Colitis (UC) have limitations. Therefore, it is important to elucidate any available alternative or complementary treatment, and Chinese herbal medicine shows the potential for such treatment. As a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, Danshen-related preparations have been reported to be beneficial for UC by improving coagulation function and inhibiting inflammatory responses. In spite of this, the credibility and safety of this practice are incomplete. Therefore, in order to investigate whether Danshen preparation (DSP) is effective and safe in the treatment of UC, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database and CQVIP Database were searched for this review.The main observation indexes were the effect of DSP combined with mesalazine or DSP on the effective rate, platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV) and C-reactive protein (CRP) of UC. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias. The selected studies were evaluated for quality and data processing using RevMan5.4 and Stata17.0 software. Results: A total of 37 studies were included. Among them, 26 clinical trials with 2426 patients were included and 11 animal experimental studies involving 208 animals were included. Meta-analysis results showed that compared with mesalazine alone, combined use of DSP can clearly improve the clinical effective rate (RR 0.86%, 95% CI:0.83-0.88, p < 0.00001) of UC. Furthermore it improved blood coagulation function by decreasing serum PLT and increasing MPV levels, and controlled inflammatory responses by reducing serum CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 levels in patients. Conclusion: Combining DSP with mesalazine for UC can enhance clinical efficacy. However, caution should be exercised in interpreting the results of this review due to its flaws, such as allocation concealment and uncertainty resulting from the blinding of the study.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a serious cardiovascular disease, which presents different pathophysiological changes with the prolongation of the disease. Compound danshen dripping pills (CDDP) has obvious advantages in MI treatment and widely used in the clinic. However, the current studies were mostly focused on the endpoint of CDDP intervention, lacking the dynamic attention to the disease process. It is of great value to establish a dynamic research strategy focused on the changes in pharmacodynamic substances for guiding clinical medication more precisely. PURPOSE: It is aimed to explore the dynamic regulating pattern of CDDP on MI based on metabolic trajectory analysis, and then clarify the variation characteristic biomarkers and pharmacodynamic substances in the intervention process. METHODS: The MI model was successfully prepared by coronary artery left anterior descending branch ligation, and then CDDP intervention was given for 28 days. Endogenous metabolites and the components of CDDP in serum were measured by LC/MS technique simultaneously to identify dynamic the metabolic trajectory and screen the characteristic pharmacodynamic substances at different points. Finally, network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques were used to simulate the core pharmacodynamic substances and core target binding, then validated at the genetic and protein level by Q-PCR and western blotting technology. RESULTS: CDDP performed typical dynamic regulation features on metabolite distribution, biological processes, and pharmacodynamic substances. During 1-7 days, it mainly regulated lipid metabolism and inflammation, the Phosphatidylcholine (PC(18:1(9Z/18:1(9Z)) and Sphingomyelin (SM(d18:1/23:1(9Z)), SM(d18:1/24:1(15Z)), SM(d18:0/16:1(9Z))) were the main characteristic biomarkers. Lipid metabolism was the mainly regulation pathway during 14-21 days, and the characteristic biomarkers were the Lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPE(0:0/20:0), PE-NMe2(22:1(13Z)/15:0)) and Sphingomyelin (SM(d18:1/23:1(9Z))). At 28 days, in addition to inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism also played the most important role. Correspondingly, Lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC(20:0/0:0)), Lysophosphatidylserine (LPS(18:0/0:0)) and Fatty acids (Linoelaidic acid) were the characteristic biomarkers. Based on the results of metabolite distribution and biological process, the characteristic pharmacodynamic substances during the intervention were further identified. The results showed that various kinds of Saponins and Tanshinones as the important active ingredients performed a long-range regulating effect on MI. And the other components, such as Tanshinol and Salvianolic acid B affected Phosphatidylcholine and Sphingomyelin through Relaxin Signaling pathway during the early intervention. Protocatechualdehyde and Rosmarinic acid affected Lysophosphatidylethanolamine and Sphingomyelin through EGFR Tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance during the late intervention. Tanshinone IIB and Isocryptotanshinone via PPAR signaling pathway affected Lysophosphatidylcholine, Lysophosphatidylserine, and Fatty acids. CONCLUSION: The dynamic regulating pattern was taken as the entry point and constructs the dynamic network based on metabolic trajectory analysis, establishes the dynamic correlation between the drug-derived components and the endogenous metabolites, and elucidates the characteristic biomarkers affecting the changes of the pharmacodynamic indexes, systematically and deeply elucidate the pharmacodynamic substance and mechanism of CDDP on MI. It also enriched the understanding of CDDP and provided a methodological reference for the dynamic analysis of complex systems of TCM.",

Despite the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination efforts, some individuals still face severe complications post-infection, including pulmonary fibrosis, myocarditis arrhythmias and stroke. This study employs a network pharmacology and molecular docking approach to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of candidate components and targets from Danshen in the treatment of complications in COVID-19. Candidate components and targets from Danshen were extracted from the TCMSP Database, while COVID-19-related targets were obtained from Genecards. Venn diagram analysis identified common targets. A Protein-Protein interaction (PPI) network and gene enrichment analysis elucidated potential therapeutic mechanisms. Molecular docking evaluated interactions between core targets and candidate components, followed by molecular dynamics simulations to assess stability. We identified 59 potential candidate components and 123 targets in Danshen for COVID-19 treatment. PPI analysis revealed 12 core targets, and gene enrichment analysis highlighted modulated pathways. Molecular docking showed favorable interactions, with molecular dynamics simulations indicating high stability of key complexes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves validated the docking protocol. Our study unveils candidate compounds, core targets, and molecular mechanisms of Danshen in COVID-19 treatment.

A middle cerebral artery occlusion model was used to simulate ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in SD rats. Overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) was achieved by AAV-HIF-1α. Rats were treated with DI or saline. Neurological scores and infarction rates were assessed. I/R damage was examined by HE, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium and Nissl stainings. Expression levels of relative proteins [TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, SOD, MDA, ROS, HIF-1α, CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and NF-κB] were measured. DI treatment improved neurological scores and reduced infarction rates, suggesting that it inhibits inflammation and oxidative stress. The expression levels of HIF-1α, CXCR4 and NF-κB were decreased. However, the effectiveness of DI on inflammation inhibition was lost after HIF-1α overexpression. DI may directly target HIF-1α to suppress neuroinflammation and reduce I/R injury by suppressing the HIF-1α/CXCR4/NF-κB signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is the main pathological basis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Fufang Danshen Tablet (FDT) is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been clinically used to treat CVDs for more than 40 years. Nevertheless, owing to the complexity of the ingredients, the pharmacological mechanism of FDT in the treatment of CVDs has not been fully elucidated. In this study, an integrated strategy of UFLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS, network pharmacology, molecular biology, and transcriptomics was used to elucidate the mechanisms of action of FDT in the treatment of atherosclerosis. In total, 22 absorbed constituents were identified in rat serum after oral administration of FDT. In silico, network pharmacology studies have shown that FDT regulates four key biological functional modules for the treatment of atherosclerosis: oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, energy metabolism, and immune/inflammation. In animal experiments, FDT exerted protective effects against atherosclerosis by reducing the plaque area and lipid levels in ApoE-/- mice. Furthermore, we found that FDT inhibited inflammatory macrophage accumulation by regulating the expression of Selp and Ccl2, which are both involved in monocyte adhesion and migration. The inhibition of monocyte recruitment by FDT is a new perspective to elucidate the anti-atherosclerotic mechanism of FDT, which has not been adopted in previous studies on FDT. Our results may help to elucidate the therapeutic mechanism of FDT against CVDs and provide potential therapeutic targets."

Methods: A computerised search was conducted on the CNKI, WF, VIP, CBM, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for RCTs of CDDP adjuvant therapy for AMI up to May 2023. STATA 17.0 was used to perform meta-analyses, sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses, meta-regression, and publication bias assessments. TSA 0.9.5.10 Beta was used for trial sequential analysis (TSA). Evidence confidence of meta results was evaluated by GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) according to the instructions. Results: The results of the meta-analysis showed that CDDP combined with conventional western treatment (CWT) was superior to CWT in increasing LVEF and TCER and decreasing LVEDD, hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α. The quality of evidence for TCER was moderate, LVEF, LVEDD, IL-6, and TNF-α were low. The TSA results showed that the total number of samples collected in this study met the requirements for meta-analysis and excluded the possibility of false positives, further confirming the efficacy of CDDP for the treatment of AMI undergoing PCI. Conclusion: Adjuvant treatment of AMI with CDDP has shown exciting and safe benefits in improving cardiac function and reducing inflammatory response in patients with AMI undergoing PCI, but the quality of some of the included studies was poor, and the results should be interpreted with caution until further confirmation by well-designed RCTs.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Compound Danshen dripping pills (CDDP), a traditional Chinese medicine, has had an extensive application in the treatment of angina pectoris (AP) in China. However, research on the bioactive ingredients and underlying mechanisms of CDDP in AP remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we explored the major chemical components and potential molecular mechanisms linked to the anti-angina effects of CDDP through the application of network pharmacology and molecular docking. METHODS: The potential targets of active ingredients in CDDP were sourced from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database (TCMSP) and the Swiss Target Prediction Database (STPD). Additionally, targets related to angina pectoris (AP) were retrieved from various databases, including Gene Cards, DisGeNET, Dis Genet, the Drug Bank database (DBD), and the Therapeutic Target Database (TDD). Protein- protein interaction networks were also established, and core targets were identified based on their topological significance. GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis were conducted using the R software. Interactions between active ingredients and potential targets selected through the above process were investigated through molecular docking. RESULTS: Seventy-six active ingredients were selected with the following criteria: OB ≥ 30%, DL ≥ 0.18. 383 targets of CDDP and 1488 targets on AP were gathered, respectively. Afterwards, 194 common targets of CDDP and anti-AP targets were defined, of which 12 were core targets. GO enrichment analysis indicated that CDDP acted on AP by response to lipopolysaccharide, regulating the reactive oxygen species and metal ion metabolism, and epithelial cell proliferation. In addition, KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the signaling pathways were notably enriched in lipid and atherosclerosis, fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis, IL-17 signaling pathway, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway. Moreover, the molecular docking manifested excellent binding capacity between the active ingredients and targets on AP. CONCLUSION: This study comprehensively illustrated the bioactive, potential targets, and molecular mechanisms of CDDP against AP, offering fresh perspectives into the molecular mechanisms of CDDP in preventing and treating AP.",

Methods: 8 databases were searched from the inception of these databases to May 2023 to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness and safety of Danshen injections in the treatment of heart failure. This NMA was performed using Stata 16.0 software and R 4.1.3 software. Results: A total of 24 RCTs involving 2,186 subjects were included. The intervention group received Danshen injections plus conventional treatment, involving the following 7 Danshen injections. The results of the NMA showed that Compound Danshen injection + Common (SUCRA: 79.6%) and Sodium tanshinone ⅡA sulfonate injection + Common (SUCRA: 78.0%) exhibited higher total effective rates. Sodium tanshinone ⅡA sulfonate injection + Common (SUCRA: 94.3%) and Danshen injection + Common (SUCRA: 68.2%) were superior to other traditional Chinese medicines in improving left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Danshen injection + Common (SUCRA: 99.9%) and Shenxiong glucose injection + Common (SUCRA: 77.2%) were the most effective in reducing brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). In addition, compared with conventional treatment, all Danshen injections did not increase the risk of adverse reactions. Conclusion: Current evidence shows that all seven Danshen injections are effective for heart failure. Due to the limited quantity and quality of the included studies, our findings need to be verified by more high-quality studies."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING) pathway is critical in the innate immune system and can be mobilized by cytosolic DNA. The various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases progression is highly correlated with aberrant cGAS-STING pathway activation. While some cGAS-STING pathway inhibitor were identified, there are no drugs that can be applied to the clinic. Compound Danshen Dripping Pill (CDDP) has been successfully used in clinic around the world, but the most common application is limited to cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the purpose of the present investigation was to examine whether CDDP inhibits the cGAS-STING pathway and could be used as a therapeutic agent for multiple cGAS-STING-triggered diseases. METHODS: BMDMs, THP1 cells or Trex1-/- BMDMs were stimulated with various cGAS-STING-agonists after pretreatment with CDDP to detect the function of CDDP on IFN-β and ISGs productionn. Next, we detect the influence on IRF3 and P65 nuclear translocation, STING oligomerization and STING-TBK1-IRF3 complex formation of CDDP. Additionally, the DMXAA-mediated activation mice model of cGAS-STING pathway was used to study the effects of CDDP. Trex1-/- mice model and HFD-mediated obesity model were established to clarify the efficacy of CDDP on inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. RESULTS: CDDP efficacy suppressed the IRF3 phosphorylation or the generation of IFN-β, ISGs, IL-6 and TNF-α. Mechanistically, CDDP did not influence the STING oligomerization and IRF3-TBK1 and STING-IRF3 interaction, but remarkably eliminated the STING-TBK1 interaction, ultimately blocking the downstream responses. In addition, we also clarified that CDDP could suppress cGAS-STING pathway activation triggered by DMXAA, in vivo. Consistently, CDDP could alleviate multi-organ inflammatory responses in Trex1-/- mice model and attenuate the inflammatory disorders, incleding obesity-induced insulin resistance. CONCLUSION: CDDP is a specifically cGAS-STING pathway inhibitor. Furthermore, we provide novel mechanism for CDDP and discovered a clinical agent for the therapy of cGAS-STING-triggered inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Although anthracyclines have demonstrated efficacy in cancer therapy, their utilization is constrained by cardiotoxicity. In contrast, Danshen injection (DSI), derived from Salvia miltiorrhiza, has a longstanding tradition of being employed to ameliorate cardiovascular ailments, including anthracycline- induced cardiotoxicity (AIC). Nonetheless, there is a notable dearth of comprehensive systematic investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying DSI's effects on AIC. Consequently, this study was undertaken to explore the underlying mechanism by which DSI acted against AIC. METHODS: Employing network pharmacology approach, the current investigation undertook a comprehensive analysis of the impact of DSI on AIC, which was further validated by transcriptome sequencing with in vitro AIC model. Additionally, molecular docking was conducted to evaluate the binding of active ingredients to core targets. A total of 3,404 AIC-related targets and 12 active ingredients in DSI, including chrysophanol, luteolin, tanshinone IIA, isoimperatorin, among others, were collected by differentially expressed analysis and database search, respectively. RESULTS: The network pharmacology and enrichment analysis suggested 102 potential targets and 29 signaling pathways associated with the protective effect of DSI on AIC. Three core targets (CA12, NOS3, and POLH) and calcium signaling pathways were further validated by transcriptomic analysis of the in-vitro model. The high affinity of the active ingredients binding to corresponding targets was confirmed by molecular docking. CONCLUSION: The present study suggested that DSI might exert a cardioprotective effect on AIC via the inhibition of CA12, NOS3, and POLH, as well as the modulation of calcium signaling. Further experiments are warranted to verify the findings.",

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we employed network pharmacology analysis to comprehensively investigate the active components, potential targets, and signaling pathways involved in DCI-mediated treatment of AP. METHODS: We utilized the mouse pancreatic acinar cell line 266-6 to establish an cholecystokinin (CCK)-induced AP cell injury model and evaluated cell viability using the Cell counting kit-8 assay. Western blotting and quantitative PCR were employed to determine the expression levels of key target proteins and genes. RESULTS: Network pharmacology analysis identified a total of 144 active components and 430 potential targets within DCI. By integrating data from public databases, we identified 762 AP-related genes. Among these, we identified 93 potential targets that may be involved in the therapeutic effects of DCI for AP. These targets were significantly enriched in biological processes such as oxidative stress, regulation of cytokine production, leukocyte migration, and the TNF signaling pathway. Molecular docking studies revealed a high binding affinity between the active components and the key targets AKT1 and NFKBA, indicative of potential interaction. Additionally, CCK-induced acinar cell injury led to upregulation of AKT1, NFKBA, and P53 proteins, as well as TNF, IL6, and MMP9 genes. Conversely, treatment with DCI dose-dependently attenuated CCK-induced acinar cell injury and restored the expression levels of the aforementioned proteins and genes. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of DCI in the treatment of AP. Our findings confirm the protective effect of DCI against CCK-induced acinar cell injury and its regulation of key targets.",

METHODS: This was a case-control study. We retrospectively reviewed clinical data of 91 patients with osteoporotic fractures who received treatment in Rui'an People's Hospital from February 2021 to July 2022. The data were divided into a control group with 44 records of patients who received treatment with calcitriol and calcium/Vitamin-D, and a study group with 47 patients who received Danshen injection combined with calcitriol and calcium/Vitamin-D. The control group individuals were coordinated with the patients in terms of their age and gender. Treatment effects, inflammatory response levels, and bone metabolic status levels were comparable between the two groups before and after the treatment. RESULTS: The total efficacy of the treatment in the study group was better than that in the control group (P<0.05). After the treatment, levels of serum inflammatory factors in both groups decreased compared to those before the treatment, and the study group displayed lower levels than the control group (P<0.05). After the treatment, the bone metabolism status of both groups improved, and the improvement effect of the study group was better (P<0.05). The incidences of adverse reactions were similar in both groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Danshen injection combined with calcitriol and calcium/Vitamin-D for the treatment of osteoporotic fractures can effectively reduce inflammation, regulate bone metabolism, and improve fracture treatment efficacy with a favorable safety profile."

The drugs currently used for treatment, such as ranibizumab, mainly focus on the middle and late periods of DR, and thus do not meet the clinical need. Here, the potential mechanisms by which compound Danshen Dripping Pills (CDDP) might protect against early DR were investigated. Methods: Db/db mice were used to establish a DR model. The initial weights and HbA1c levels of the mice were monitored, and retinal pathology was assessed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The vascular permeability of the retina and thickness of each retinal layer were measured, and electroretinogram were performed together with fundus fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography. The levels of inflammatory factors were examined in retinal tissue, as well as those of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) in the serum using ELISA. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and Bclassociated X protein (Bax). Retinal cell injury and apoptosis were examined by TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) assays. Results: The data showed that CDDP significantly improved cellular disarrangement. Imaging data indicated that CDDP could reduce vascular permeability and the amplitude of oscillatory potentials (OPs), and restore the thickness of the ganglion cell layer. Moreover, CDDP reduced the expression levels of inflammatory factors in both the retina and serum. Conclusion: These findings strongly suggest that CDDP prevents early DR through vascular and neuroprotection."

This study aims to explore the relationship between Danshen use and cardiovascular risks among bladder cancer patients. Methods: Patients were selected based on a confirmed diagnosis of bladder cancer with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria to control for certain comorbidities and treatments. Utilizing Taiwan's National Health Insurance data from 2003 to 2013, this retrospective, population-based study identified three groups: 525 patients treated with Danshen, 6,419 patients not treated with TCM, and 4,356 patients treated with TCM but not with Danshen. The Cox proportional hazard model was employed to estimate the risks of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) and mortality while accounting for various confounders. Results: The overall incidence of MACEs was significantly lower in the Danshen group (5%) compared to the TCM (8.1%) and non-TCM (9.9%) groups (p < 0.001). The Cox model revealed that bladder cancer patients treated with Danshen had the lowest risk of MACE (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.84) and all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.82). Discussion: The findings suggest that Danshen reduces the risk of MACE and all-cause mortality in bladder cancer patients, highlighting its potential benefits. This underpins the necessity for further research to substantiate the cardiovascular benefits of Danshen in bladder cancer patients and potentially broaden its application in oncology healthcare."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is one of the most common complications after coronary stent implantation due to the extensive development of coronary catheterization technology. Compound Danshen dripping pills (CDDP) are clinically used as cardiovascular drugs, relieving systemic inflammatory response. Previous studies have observed that CDDP can decrease CIN incidence after coronary stent implantation with uncertain effectiveness. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, single-center, single-blind, controlled trial. We enrolled patients 18 years and older with unstable angina pectoris and NSTEMI who underwent PCI at the Tianjin Chest Hospital between November 1, 2021, and November 31, 2022, and followed for 30 days. Patients were randomized to CDDP and hydration therapy (10 capsules three times/day; N = 411) or hydration only (N = 411). The primary outcome was the contrast nephropathy incidence, defined as an elevation in serum creatinine by more than 25% or 44 μmol/L from baseline within 48-72 h of contrast exposure. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events post-surgery and during follow-up. RESULTS: After 48 h of operation, the two groups had statistical significance in Scr and BUN values (80.0 ± 12.59 vs. 84.43 ± 13.49, P < 0.05; 6.22 ± 1.01 vs. 6.40 ± 0.93, P < 0.05). The difference in Scr in 72 h between the two groups was statistically significant (76.42 ± 10.92 vs. 79.06 ± 11.58, P < 0.05). The CIN incidence was significantly lower in the CDDP group than in the hydration group. The CIN risk was significantly elevated in patients with LVEF <50%, contrast volume ≥160 ml, and hypertension, after 48 and 72 h of operation. The serum inflammation index levels NGAL, TNF-α, oxidative stress indexes SOD, and MDA significantly differed between the two groups. However, there was no significant difference in serum apoptosis indexes Bax, Bcl-2, and Casepase-9. CONCLUSIONS: CDDP pre-treatment could prevent contrast-induced nephropathy. Inflammatory response and oxidative stress could be significant in the CDDP mechanism."

      "abstract": "In recent years, more and more evidence has shown that the disorder of gut microbiota (GM) is closely correlated with myocardial ischemia (MI). Even though the Danshen and Honghua herb pair (DHHP) is widely used in treating cardiovascular disease in China and exhibits obvious clinical efficacy on MI, the anti-MI mechanism of DHHP remains and needs to be explored in depth. Thus, in this study, we investigated whether the amelioration effect and molecular mechanism of DHHP on MI were related to regulating GM through pharmacodynamics evaluation and metagenomic sequencing. Histopathological testing results showed that DHHP treatment could alleviate the pathological changes of myocardial tissue in the acute MI (AMI) rats induced by isoproterenol (ISO), especially structural disorder, irregular distribution, and enlargement of the myocardial space. These pathological changes were all alleviated to some extent by DHHP treatment. Biochemical analysis results suggested that compared with the control group, the serum levels of AST, CTn-I, CK-MB, and TNF-α in model group rats were notably decreased, and the CAT and SOD levels in serum were markedly increased. These abnormal trends were significantly reversed by DHHP treatment. Furthermore, metagenomic sequencing analysis results indicated that DHHP could improve disorders in the composition and function of GM in AMI rats, mainly reflected in increasing diversity and richness, and obviously enhancing the abundance of Bacteroides fluxus, B. uniformis, B. stercoris, Roseburia hominis, Schaedlerella arabinosiphila, and R. intestinalis, and reducing the abundance of Enterococcus avium and E. canintestini, which were associated with purine metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, cyanoamino acid metabolism, and glutathione metabolism. In conclusion, DHHP may attenuate ISO-induced MI by regulating the structure, composition, and function of GM, thus contributing to further our understanding of the anti-MI mechanisms of DHHP and providing new therapeutic ideas and diagnostic targets for the clinical studies of MI.",

      "abstract": "Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by cisplatin remains a major impediment to the clinical application of cisplatin, necessitating urgent exploration for promising solutions. Huangqi-Danshen decoction (HDD), a Chinese herbal preparation, has been shown by our group to have a reno-protective effect in adenine-induced chronic kidney disease mice and diabetic db/db mice. However, the effect of HDD on cisplatin-induced AKI and its underlying mechanisms are unknown. Methods: The AKI model was established by intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin (20 mg/kg) in C57BL/6 mice. The mice in the treatment group were administrated with HDD (6.8 g/kg/d) for 5 consecutive days before cisplatin challenge. After 72 h cisplatin injection, blood and kidney tissue were subsequently collected for biochemical detection, histopathological evaluation, Western blot analysis, immunohistochemical staining, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to detect changes in renal metabolites. Results: The results showed that HDD significantly reduced serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels and alleviated renal histopathological injury in cisplatin-induced AKI mice. And HDD treatment demonstrated a significant inhibition in apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in AKI mice. Moreover, non-target metabolomics revealed that HDD significantly restored 165 altered metabolites in AKI mice. Subsequent enrichment analysis and pathway analysis of these metabolites indicated that nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism was the primary pathway affected by HDD intervention. Further investigation showed that HDD could upregulate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthesis-related enzymes quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase, nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1, and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase to replenish NAD+ content in the kidney of AKI mice. Conclusion: In summary, HDD exerted a protective effect against cisplatin-induced AKI and suppressed apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in the kidney of AKI mice, which may be attributed to the modulation of NAD+ biosynthesis."

METHODS: A total of 1,428 patients diagnosed with CHD screened for anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QOL) at baseline received 0.4 g of GXDSDP treatment 3 times per day and returned for monthly reassessment. Patients were recruited after stable treatment for CHD and received assessment of General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) for evaluating anxiety, depression, and QOL. Patients were followed up 3 times, once every 4 weeks, during outpatient visits for 12 weeks. RESULTS: At the third follow-up (F3), the anxiety symptom of 63.79% (673/1,055) of the patients improved to sub-clinical level, and the GAD-7 score improved significantly (8.11 vs. 3.87, P<0.01); 57.52% (585/1,017) patients' depressive symptoms improved to sub-clinical level, with a significant improvement in PHQ-9 score (8.69 vs. 4.41, P<0.01) at F3. All aspects of QOL significantly improved at the end of treatment compared to those at baseline (all P<0.01) as assessed by SAQ: physical limitation (31.17 vs. 34.14), anginal stability (2.74 vs. 4.14), anginal frequency (8.16 vs. 9.10), treatment satisfaction (13.43 vs. 16.29), and disease perception (8.69 vs. 11.02).

This study aimed to analyze the effectiveness and safety of CDDP in the blood viscosity (BV) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic search of seven databases from their inception to July 2022 for randomized controlled trials that used CDDP to treat T2DM. To evaluate BV, we measured low shear rate (LSR), high shear rate (HSR), and plasma viscosity (PV). Homocysteine and adiponectin levels were also assessed as factors that could affect BV. Results: We included 18 studies and 1532 patients with T2DM. Meta-analysis revealed that CDDP significantly reduced LSR (mean difference [MD] -2.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.77 to -1.72), HSR (MD -0.86, 95% CI -1.08 to -0.63), and PV (MD -0.37, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.19) compared to controls. CDDP also reduced homocysteine (MD -8.32, 95% CI -9.05 to -7.58), and increased plasma adiponectin (MD 2.72, 95% CI 2.13 to 3.32). Adverse events were reported less frequently in the treatment groups than in controls. Conclusions: CDDP is effective in reducing BV on T2DM. However, due to the poor design and quality of the included studies, high-quality, well-designed studies are required in the future.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic progressive interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology, is characterized by continuous damage to alveolar epithelial cells, abnormal repair of alveolar tissue, and alveolar wall scar formation. Currently, the recommended treatment for IPF in Western medicine is relatively limited. In contrast, traditional Chinese medicine and compound prescriptions show advantages in the diagnosis and treatment of IPF, which can be attributed to their multi-channel and multi-target characteristics and minimal side-effects. The purpose of this study was to further corroborate the effectiveness and significance of the traditional Chinese medications Astragalus and Danshen in IPF treatment. METHODS: We performed whole-genome methylation analysis on nine rat lung tissue samples to determine the epigenetic variation between IPF and non-fibrotic lungs using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions. RESULTS: We identified differentially methylated regions and 105 associated key functional genes in samples related to IPF and Chinese medicine treatment. Based on the methylation levels and gene expression profiles between the Chinese medicine intervention and pulmonary fibrosis model groups, we speculated that Astragalus and Salvia miltiorrhiza (traditionally known as Danshen) act on the Isl1, forkhead box O3, and Sonic hedgehog genes via regulation at transcriptional and epigenetic levels during IPF. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of IPF, indicate the effectiveness of Astragalus and Danshen in treating IPF, and suggest several promising therapeutic targets for preventing and treating IPF.",

Studying the mechanism of action of Danshen and Jiangxiang in the treatment of IS can effectively identify candidate traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) with efficacy. However, it is challenging to analyze the effector substances and explain the mechanism of action of Danshen-Jiangxiang from a systematic perspective using traditional pharmacological approaches. In this study, a systematic study was conducted based on the drug-target-symptom-disease association network using complex network theory. On the basis of the association information about Danshen, Jiangxiang and IS, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and the \"drug pair-pharmacodynamic ingredient-target-IS\" network were constructed. The different topological features of the networks were analyzed to identify the core pharmacodynamic ingredients including formononetin in Jiangxiang, cryptotanshinone and tanshinone IIA in Danshen as well as core target proteins such as prostaglandin G/H synthase 2, retinoic acid receptor RXR-alpha, sodium channel protein type 5 subunit alpha, prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptor. Further, a method for screening IS candidates based on TCM symptoms was proposed to identify key TCM symptoms and syndromes using the \"drug pair-TCM symptom-syndrome-IS\" network. The results showed that three TCMs, namely Puhuang, Sanleng and Zelan, might be potential therapeutic candidates for IS, which provided a theoretical reference for the development of drugs for the treatment of IS.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ventricular remodeling after acute anterior wall ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (AAMI) is an important factor in occurrence of heart failure which additionally results in poor prognosis. Therefore, the treatment of ventricular remodeling needs to be further optimized. Compound Danshen Dripping Pills (CDDP), a traditional Chinese medicine, exerts a protective effect on microcirculatory disturbance caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury and attenuates ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction. OBJECTIVE: This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CDDP in improving ventricular remodeling and cardiac function after AAMI on a larger scale. METHODS: This study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. The total of 268 patients with AAMI after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) will be randomly assigned 1:1 to the CDDP group (n=134) and control group (n=134) with a follow-up of 48 weeks. Both groups will be treated with standard therapy of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), with the CDDP group administrating 20 tablets of CDDP before pPCI and 10 tablets 3 times daily after pPCI, and the control group treated with a placebo simultaneously. The primary endpoint is 48-week echocardiographic outcomes including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI), and left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI). The secondary endpoint includes the change in N terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level, arrhythmias, and cardiovascular events (death, cardiac arrest, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, rehospitalization due to heart failure or angina pectoris, deterioration of cardiac function, and stroke). Investigators and patients are both blinded to the allocated treatment. DISCUSSION: This prospective study will investigate the efficacy and safety of CDDP in improving ventricular remodeling and cardiac function in patients undergoing pPCI for a first AAMI. Patients in the CDDP group will be compared with those in the control group. If certified to be effective, CDDP treatment in AAMI will probably be advised on a larger scale.

AIM OF THE STUDY: Elucidate the mechanism of HD against CI based on symptom-oriented network pharmacology coupled with comprehensive chemical characterization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS technology was firstly used to obtain the chemical profile of HD constituents. A comprehensive strategy combining in-house library, diagnostic ions, Compound Discover software and network databases was then established to identify its chemical constitutes. Symptomatic treatment is a treatment aimed at relieving or eliminating symptoms which is often characterized as a stop-gap measure due to its inability to cure the disease fundamentally. Nevertheless, symptomatic treatment is an indispensable part of clinical practice and has an important place in medical therapeutics. Therefore, network pharmacology technique were used to elucidate molecular mechanisms from the symptoms of CI. Finally, some literatures were further mined to support our conclusions. RESULTS: A total of 190 ingredients were identified in HD. Symptom-oriented network pharmacology analysis indicated that compounds of HD relieved \"blood\" through the regulation of ADORA2A, ADORA1, PTPN11, MMP9 and EGFR, relieved \"qi\" via the regulation of ADORA2A, EGFR, MMP9 and CA2. The therapeutic effect of HD on \"faint\" was linked to PTPN11 and MMP9, while the regulation of \"dyskinesia\" was related to ADORA2A and EGFR, and ADORA1, PTPN11 and MMP9 were associated withe its effect on \"speech disorder\". ADORA1, ADORA2A and MMP9 were key to the HD component in treating \"visual disturbance\".

TSA also inhibited the activation of brain nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (MD, - 0.36; 95% CI, [-0.41, -0.32]; P < 0.00001), malondialdehyde (MDA) (MD, -0.90; 95% CI, [-1.66, -0.13]; P = 0.02), cysteine protease-3 (Caspase-3) (MD, -1.39; 95% CI, [-1.98, -0.81]; P < 0.00001), and reduced cerebral infarction volume(MD, -16.26; 95% CI, [-20.76, -11.77]; P < 0.00001), brain water content (MD, -4.89; 95% CI, [-7.06, -2.71]; P < 0.0001) and neurological deficit scores (MD, -1.19; 95% CI, [-1.48, -0.89]; P < 0.00001). Additionally, TSA increased the brain content of superoxide dismutase (SOD) (MD, 68.31; 95% CI, [10.41, 126.22]; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The result of this study showed that TSA had a protective effect on cerebral ischemic injury in animal models, and the mechanism is associated with the reduction of inflammation and oxidative stress, and the inhibition of cell apoptosis. However, the quality of included studies may affect the accuracy of positive results. Therefore, more high-quality randomized controlled animal experiments are need for meta-analysis in the future.",

      "abstract": "Huangqi-Danshen decoction (HDD), a Chinese herbal preparation, is effective in clinical treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the underlying mechanism remains to be clarified. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of HDD in the regulation of renal glucose metabolism in a CKD mouse model. The 0.2% adenine-induced CKD mouse model was administered HDD extract at a dose of 6.8 g/kg/day for 4 weeks. Detection of renal glucose metabolites was performed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The expression of renal fibrosis and glucose metabolism-related proteins was tested by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. The results showed that HDD treatment could significantly reduce serum creatinine (0.36 ± 0.10 mg/dL vs. 0.51 ± 0.07 mg/dL, P < 0.05) and blood urea nitrogen (40.02 ± 3.73 mg/dL vs. 62.91 ± 10 mg/dL, P < 0.001) levels, and improve renal pathological injury and fibrosis. Aberrant glucose metabolism was found in the kidneys of CKD mice, manifested by enhanced glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway, and tricarboxylic acid cycle inhibition, which could be partially restored by HDD treatment. Furthermore, HDD regulated the expression of hexokinase 2, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase M2, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1, oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in CKD mice. In conclusion, HDD protected against adenine-induced CKD, reshaped glucose metabolism profiles, and restored the expression of key enzymes of glucose metabolism in the kidneys of CKD mice. This study sheds light on targeting glucose metabolism for the treatment of CKD and screening small molecule compounds from herbal medicine to slow CKD progression.",

However, warfarin has a narrow therapeutic index, wide interindividual variability (genetic and non-genetic factors), and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions. Our previous study indicated that CDDP might interact with warfarin in individuals with the epoxide hydrolase gene (EPHX1; single-nucleotide polymorphism: rs2292566) A/A subtype. We sought to clarify the interaction between CDDP and warfarin associated with EPHX1 in a comprehensive and accurate manner. Methods: Here, EPHX1 A and EPHX1 G cell lines were established. Expression of microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH), vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR), and vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (FII, FVII, FIX, FX) was measured by western blotting upon incubation with CDDP and warfarin. mEH activity was evaluated by measuring the transformation of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids into dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids. Then, healthy volunteers (HVs) with the EPHX1 A/A genotype were recruited and administered warfarin and CDDP to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin. Results: CDDP combined with warfarin could decrease expression of mEH and VKOR, and increase protein expression of FII, FVII, FIX, and FX, in EPHX1 A cells. CDDP could slightly influence the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of warfarin in HVs with the EPHX1 A/A genotype. Discussion: Rational combination of CDDP and warfarin was safe with no risk of bleeding, but the therapeutic management is also needed. The clinical study is posted in the China Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR190002434)."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The incidence of heart failure (HF) is increasing year by year, posing a great threat to human health. Although pharmacotherapy has been able to significantly prolong patient survival, pharmacotherapy for HF still has limitations due to its complex pathogenesis and considerable individual variability, there is a great need to explore complementary and alternative therapies to slow down the progression of HF. Danshen decoction is used to treat several cardiovascular diseases including HF, but the efficacy of stabilization is uncertain. This meta-analysis evaluated the clinical efficacy of Danshen Decoction for the treatment of HF. METHODS: The registration number assigned to this meta-analysis on the PROSPERO platform is CRD42022351918. Four databases were searched, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Danshen decoction combined with conventional treatment (CT) of HF were screened, CT included medical treatments other than Danshen Decoction to which the patient was treated (including but not limited to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, β-blockers, diuretics, mineralcorticoid recept antagonist etc.). The clinical efficacy rate (CER), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were included as outcome indicators. The GRADE grading scale was used to grade the above indicators. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and the Jadad quality scale were used to assess the methodological quality of RCTs. Finally, RevMan V.4.5 software was used for data synthesis, 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data, risk ratios (RR), and mean differences (MD) for continuous variables were calculated, Chi-square and I2 were used for heterogeneity assessment. RESULTS: Nine RCTs with a total of 855 patients were included in this study, and all included RCTs had a low overall quality risk of bias and high quality of reported information. The results of the meta-analysis showed that compared with the use of CT, CER (%) was significantly improved due to Danshen decoction combined with CT (MD = 3.95, 95% CI [2.58, 6.04], P < 0.00001), LVEF (%) was significantly improved (MD = 5.46, 95% CI [5.32, 5.60], P < 0.00001), LVEDD (mm) was significantly reduced (MD = -5.27, 95% CI [-6.21, -4.32], P < 0.00001), LVESD (mm) was significantly reduced (MD = -4.60, 95% CI [-5.87, -3.32], P < 0.00001), BNP (pg/mL) was significantly reduced (MD = -88.61, 95% CI [-121.98, -55.24], P < 0.00001), NT-proBNP (pg/mL) was significantly decreased (SMD = -3.33, 95% CI [-5.92, -0.73], P = 0.01), hs-CRP (mg/L) was significantly decreased (MD = -2.73, 95% CI [-4.11, -1.34], P = 0.0001). The quality of the GRADE evidence for all outcomes was moderate to low and no RCTs reported adverse events. CONCLUSION: Our research demonstrates that Danshen decoction is an effective and safe treatment option for HF. Nevertheless, considering the limitations of methodological and the quality of RCTs, more rigorous, large-scale, multicenter randomized clinical trials are needed to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of Danshen decoction in the treatment of HF patients.",

      "abstract": "Heart failure is the leading cause of death worldwide. Compound Danshen Dripping Pill (CDDP) or CDDP combined with simvastatin has been widely used to treat patients with myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular diseases in China. However, the effect of CDDP on hypercholesterolemia/atherosclerosis-induced heart failure is unknown. We constructed a new model of heart failure induced by hypercholesterolemia/atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and LDL receptor (LDLR) dual deficient (ApoE-/-LDLR-/-) mice and investigated the effect of CDDP or CDDP plus a low dose of simvastatin on the heart failure. CDDP or CDDP plus a low dose of simvastatin inhibited heart injury by multiple actions including anti-myocardial dysfunction and anti-fibrosis. Mechanistically, both Wnt and lysine-specific demethylase 4A (KDM4A) pathways were significantly activated in mice with heart injury. Conversely, CDDP or CDDP plus a low dose of simvastatin inhibited Wnt pathway by markedly up-regulating expression of Wnt inhibitors. While the anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative stress by CDDP were achieved by inhibiting KDM4A expression and activity. In addition, CDDP attenuated simvastatin-induced myolysis in skeletal muscle. Taken together, our study suggests that CDDP or CDDP plus a low dose of simvastatin can be an effective therapy to reduce hypercholesterolemia/atherosclerosis-induced heart failure."

Herein, we reported a method to screen the functional components in Danshen Decoction targeting endothelin receptor A, an accepted target for the treatment of the disease. The receptor was functionalized on the macroporous silica gel through an epidermal growth factor receptor fusion tag and its covalent inhibitor. Using the affinity gel as the stationary phase, the bioactive compound was identified as salvianolic acid B by mass spectrometry. The binding kinetic parameter (dissociation rate constants kd ) of salvianolic acid B with the receptor was determined via peak profiling. Using the specific ligands of the receptor as probes, the binding configuration prediction of salvianolic acid B with the receptor was performed by molecular dynamics simulation. Our results indicated that salvianolic acid B is a potential bioactive compound in Danshen Decoction targeting the receptor. This work showed that receptor chromatography in combination with molecular dynamics simulation is applicable to predicting the binding kinetics and configuration of a ligand to a receptor, providing crucial insight for the rational design of drugs that recognize functional proteins.",

However, the clinical efficacy of such preparations remains unclear. Consequently, Danshen preparations are used to a lesser extent in vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, we aimed to systematically assess the clinical efficacy and safety of Danshen preparations in VCI. To this end, we examined and performed a meta-analysis (MA) of the evidence available from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of Danshen preparations conducted in patients with VCI. METHODS: We queried the following sources and collected all articles reporting on RCTs of Danshen preparations published prior to December 2021: PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, Chongqing VIP Database (CQVIP), and China Biology Medicine (CBM) disc databases. The assessment of treatments that were included in references were performed by RevMan 5.2 software based on guidelines from Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. RESULTS: We included a total of 12 RCTs that included data on clinical therapeutic effects. The evaluation criteria included the following: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Barthel Index (BI), Mini-Mental State Assessment (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADL), treatment effect index, and incidence of adverse reaction index. In the included studies, the observation groups included 656 cases and the control groups included 660 cases. The results of the MA were as follows: the mean difference (MD) value after combining the effect size for NIHSS was -2.91, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of -4.22 to -1.59; the combined effect quantity hypothesis test revealed that Z = 4.33 (p < 0.00001), indicating that the score pertaining to the degree of neurological deficit (NIHSS) in the observation group after treatment was significantly lower than that in the control group. This result reveals that treatment with a Danshen preparation can reduce neurological deficit in VCI patients. The MD value after combining the effect size for mRS was -0.73, with a 95% CI of -0.85 to -0.61; the result of the combined effect quantity hypothesis test revealed that Z = 12.29 (p < 0.00001). These results indicate that the degree of disability was significantly reduced after treatment in the observation group. The MD value after combining the effect size for MMSE was 2.09, with a 95% CI of 0.33-3.84; the result of the combined effect quantity hypothesis test showed that Z = 2.33 (p = 0.02). These results indicate that the cognitive function score (MMSE) of the observation group after treatment was significantly higher than that of the control group and suggests that the cognitive function of VCI patients was improved after treatment with Danshen preparations. The MD value after combining the effect size for ADL was 8.79, with a 95% CI of 3.52 to 14.06; the result of the combined effect quantity hypothesis test indicated that Z = 3.27 (p = 0.001). These results showed that the life ability (ADL scale) scores of patients in the observation group after treatment were significantly higher than those in the control group, and reveals that after treatment with Danshen preparations, patients exhibited significant improvement in life ability. The MD value after combining the effect size for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was -3.21, with a 95% CI of -4.21 to -2.22; the result of the combined effect quantity hypothesis test showed that Z = 6.31 (p < 0.00001), indicating that the hs-CRP level in the observation group was significantly decreased after treatment. The MD value after combining the effect size for interleukin (IL)-6 was -2.95, with a 95% CI of -3.86 to -2.04; the result of the combined effect quantity hypothesis test showed that Z = 6.36 (p < 0.00001). These results showed that the IL-6 level in the observation group was significantly decreased after treatment. CONCLUSION: The existing clinical evidence shows that Danshen preparations exert significant therapeutic effects on VCI patients and can ameliorate inflammatory conditions in these patients. In addition, Danshen preparations are relatively safe."

Compound Danshen Dripping Pills (CDDP) treatment has shown remarkable improvement in cognitive impairment in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in clinical settings, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. PURPOSE: An extensive detailed strategy via in vivo functional experiments, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and network pharmacology was adopted to investigate the CDDP-treatment mechanism in diabetic cognitive dysfunction. METHODS: For 12 weeks, KK-Ay mice, a spontaneous T2DM model, were intragastrically administered various doses of CDDP solution or an equivalent volume of water, and the nootropic drug piracetam was orally administered as a positive control. At the 12th week, cognition was assessed using Morris water maze tests and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Furthermore, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and network pharmacology analyses were applied to reveal novel molecular mechanisms of CDDP-treatment in diabetic cognitive dysfunction of KK-Ay mice, which were then validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. RESULTS: Here we verified that CDDP can suppress inflammatory response and alleviate the cognitive dysfunction in KK-Ay mice. Also, as demonstrated by 16S rRNA sequencing and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) analysis, CDDP attenuated intestinal flora disorder as well as increases of metabolites including butyric acid, hexanoic acid, and isohexic acid. Given the integrated analyses of network pharmacology, transcriptomic, metabolomic data, and molecular biology, the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway was activated in diabetes, which could be reversed by CDDP. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that CDDP restructures the gut microbiota composition and increased the intestinal SCFAs in KK-Ay mice, which might inhibit neuroinflammation, and thus improve diabetic mice cognitive disorder.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Dan-Shen Decoction, which is composed of Danshen, Tanxiang and Sharen, has a good therapeutic effect on ischemic heart disease (IHD). However, systematic research on the exact mechanism of action of Dan-Shen Decoction is still lacking. The anti-IHD effect of Dan-Shen Decoction was examined in this study using a systematic pharmacological method. OBJECTIVE: This study validates the efficacy and explores the potential mechanisms of Dan-Shen Decoction in treating IHD by integrating network pharmacology analyses and experimental verification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The active components, critical targets and potential mechanisms of Dan-Shen Decoction against IHD were predicted by network pharmacology and molecule docking. H9c2 cells were pretreated with various 1 µg/mL Dan-Shen Decoction for 2 h before induction with 1000 µmol/L CoCl2 for 24 h. The cell viability was detected by CCK8, and protein expression was detected by western blots. RESULTS: The network pharmacology approach successfully identified 69 active components in Dan-Shen Decoction, and 122 potential targets involved in the treatment of IHD. The in vitro experiments indicate that the anti-IHD effect of Dan-Shen Decoction may be closely associated with targets such as AKT1 and MAPK1, as well as biological processes such as cell proliferation, inflammatory response, and metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: This study not only provides new insights into the mechanism of Dan-Shen Decoction against IHD, but also provides important information and new research ideas for the discovery of anti-IHD compounds from traditional Chinese medicine.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Every year, approximately 17 million people worldwide die due to coronary heart disease, with China ranking second in terms of the death toll. Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) significantly influences cardiac function and prognosis in cardiac surgery patients. Jiawei Danshen Decoction (JWDSD) is a traditional Chinese herbal prescription that has been used clinically for many years in China to treat MIRI. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remain unknown. To investigate the proteomic changes in myocardial tissue of rats given JWDSD for MIRI therapy-based proteomics. METHODS: MIRI rat model was created by ligating/releasing the left anterior descending coronary artery. For seven days, the drugs were administered twice daily. The model was created following the last drug administration. JWDSD's efficacy in improving MIRI was evaluated using biochemical markers and cardiac histology. Tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomics (TMT) technology was also used to detect proteins in the extracted heart tissue. To analyze differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), bioinformatics analysis, including gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathways, were employed. Furthermore, western blotting confirmed the potential targets regulated by JWDSD. RESULTS: The histopathologic characteristics and biochemical data showed JWDSD's protective effects on MIRI rats. A total of 4549 proteins were identified with FDR (false discovery rate) ≤1%. Twenty overlapping were identified (162 DEPs and 45 DEPs in Model/Control or JWDSD/Model group, respectively). Of these DEPs, 16 were regulated by JWDSD. GO analysis provided a summary of the deregulated protein expression in the categories of biological process (BP), cell component (CC), and molecular function (MF). KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the signaling pathways of neutrophil extracellular trap formation, RNA polymerase, serotonergic synapse, and linoleic acid metabolism are all closely related to JWDSD effects in MIRI rats. Furthermore, T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (TIAM1) was validated using western blotting, and the results were consistent with proteomics data. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that JWDSD may exert therapeutic effects through multi-pathways regulation in MIRI treatment. This work may provide proteomics clues for continuing research on JWDSD in treating MIRI."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are among the primary and predominant threats to human health with increasing incidence. Danshen Decoction (DSD) as an adjuvant therapy can benefit CVDs patients by improving clinical efficacy. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify the active components and potential pharmacological mechanisms of DSD by combining mass spectrometry with a network pharmacology strategy and to review the use of DSD in the treatment of CVDs. METHOD: First, the composition of DSD was analyzed by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Second, the network pharmacology method was used to elucidate the underlying material basis and possible pharmacological mechanism of DSD for the treatment of CVDs. Finally, clinical and experimental studies on DSD in the past ten years were retrieved from the PubMed and CNKI database, and the content of these studies was used to summarize the latest progress in DSD treatment of CVDs. OUTCOME: A total of 35 compounds were found in DSD by manual identification from the analysis of MS, which may be the material basis for the therapeutic effect of DSD. After taking the intersection of 2086 targets related to CVDs, these 35 compounds are considered to play a role in the treatment of CVDs through 210 targets including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), sarcoma (SRC) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit (PIK3R), and a total of 168 signaling pathways were involved in the regulation of CVDs by DSD, including PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, Alzheimer disease, and Rap1 signaling pathway. A total of 29 clinical studies using DSD in the treatment of CVDs were included in the literature review, and these studies showed the positive significance of DSD as adjuvant therapy, while 14 experimental studies included in the literature review also demonstrated the effectiveness of DSD in the treatment of CVDs. CONCLUSION: DSD plays a role in the treatment of CVDs through a variety of active ingredients. Large-scale clinical research and more in-depth experimental research will help to further reveal the mechanism of DSD in the treatment of CVDs.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of Guanxin Danshen Dripping Pills (GXDS) in the treatment of depression or anxiety in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: From September 2017 to June 2019, 200 CHD patients after PCI with depression and anxiety were included and randomly divided into GXDS (100 cases) and placebo control groups (100 cases) by block randomization and a random number table. Patients in the GXDS and control groups were given GXDS and placebo, respectively, 0.4 g each time, 3 times daily for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes were scores of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7) and the Seattle Angina Pectoris Scale (SAQ). The secondary outcomes included 12 Health Survey Summary Form (SF-12) scores and the first onset time and incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Other indices including blood pressure, blood lipids, microcirculation and inflammatory-related indices, etc. were monitored at baseline, week 4, and week 12. RESULTS: In the full analysis set (200 cases), after treatment, the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores in the GXDS group were considerably lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). Compared with the baseline, the total PHQ-9 scores of the experimental and control groups decreased by 3.97 and 1.18, respectively. The corrected mean difference between the two groups was -2.78 (95% CI: -3.47, -2.10; P<0.001). The total GAD-7 score in the GXDS group decreased by 3.48% compared with the baseline level, while that of the placebo group decreased by 1.13%. The corrected mean difference between the two groups was -2.35 (95% CI: -2.95, -1.76; P<0.001). The degree of improvement in SAQ score, SF-12 score, endothelin and high-sensitive C-reactive protein levels in the GXDS group were substantially superior than those in the placebo group, and the differences between the two groups were statistically significant (P<0.05). Similar results were obtained in the per protocol population analysis of 177 patients. Three cases of MACES were reported in this study (1 in the GXDS group and 2 in the placebo group), and no serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: GXDS can significantly alleviate depression and anxiety, relieve symptoms of angina, and improve quality of life in patients with CHD after PCI. (Registration No. ChiCTR1800014291).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Danshen injection (DSI) is an agent extracted from the Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, a natural drug commonly used to alleviate kidney diseases. However, the material basis and therapeutic effects of DSI on nephrotic syndrome (NS) remain unclear. PURPOSE: To investigate the material basis of DSI and the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of NS. METHODS: NS models were established using adriamycin-induced BALB/c mice and lipopolysaccharide-induced mouse podocytes (MPC-5). Following DSI and prednisone administration, kidney coefficients, 24 h urine protein, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine levels were tested. Histomorphology was observed by periodic acid-Schiff staining and hematoxylin and eosin staining of the kidney sections. The glomerular basement membrane and autophagosomes of the kidneys were observed using transmission electron microscopy. Nephrin and desmin levels in the glomeruli were tested using immunohistochemistry. The viability of MPC-5 cells was tested using cell counting kit-8 after chloroquine and rapamycin administration in combination with DSI. The in vivo and in vitro protein levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT, phosphorylated AKT (Ser473), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), beclin1, cleaved caspase-3, and caspase-3 were detected using western blotting. RESULTS: Our results showed that DSI contained nine main components: caffeic acid, danshensu, lithospermic acid, rosmarinic acid, salvianolic acid A, salvianolic acid B, salvianolic acid C, salvianolic acid D, and 3, 4-Dihydroxybenzaldehyde. In in vivo studies, the NS mice showed renal function and pathological impairment. Podocytes were damaged, with decreased levels of autophagy and apoptosis, accompanied by inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. DSI administration resulted in improved renal function and pathology in NS mice, with the activation of autophagy and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in the kidneys. Additionally, podocytes were less damaged and intracellular autophagosomes were markedly increased. In vitro studies have shown that DSI activated MPC-5 autophagy and reduced apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. CONCLUSION: Collectively, this study demonstrated that DSI activated podocyte autophagy and reduced apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, ultimately attenuating NS. Our study clarified the main components of DSI and elucidated its therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms for NS, providing new targets and agents for the clinical treatment of NS.",

Moreover, the DH herbal pair alleviated phenylhydrazine (PHZ)-induced thrombosis and improved bisphenol F (BPF)- and ponatinib-induced brain injury in zebrafish. Furthermore, the spectrum-effect relationship between the fingerprint of the DH herbal pair and the antithrombotic and neuroprotective efficacy was analyzed, and 11 chemical components were screened out as the multi-component combination (MCC) against VaD. Among them, the two compounds with the highest content were salvianolic acid B (17.31 ± 0.20 mg/g) and hydroxysafflor yellow A (15.85 ± 0.19 mg/g). Finally, we combined these 11 candidate compounds as the MCC and found that it could improve thrombosis and neuronal injury in three zebrafish models and rat bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) model, which had similar efficacy compared to the DH herbal pair.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the retinal consequence of chronic progressive diabetic microvascular leakage and occlusion. Non-proliferating diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) is the early stage of DR. It eventually occurs to some degree in all patients with diabetes mellitus. In recent years, many clinical trials have shown that Compound Danshen Dripping Pill (CDDP) may be associated with the improvement of NPDR symptoms. The aim of this study was to quantitatively summarize the association between CDDP and the therapeutic effects of NPDR. METHODS: It was conducted that a systematic literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, VIP and Wanfang Data updated in June 2020 with the following search terms: \"diabetic retinopathy\" or \"retinopathy\" or \"DR\" or \"NPDR\", in combination with \"Compound Danshen Dripping Pill\" or \"Salvia miltiorrhiza\" or \"Danshen\". Risk ratio (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) with their 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated between treatment and control groups. The sensitivity analyses were undertaken by removing each individual study when high heterogeneity appeared. Subgroup analysis, Meta-regression, and publication bias analysis were also conducted. The strength of evidence was evaluated with the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) method. RESULTS: Twenty-six RCTs involving 2047 subjects were included to conduct a Meta-analysis after screening the studies, extracting the data, and assessing the study quality. The Stata15.0 software was utilized for processing. Meta-analysis indicated that curative effects of treatment group with CDDP was significantly better than control [RR = 0.54, 95% CI (0.40, 0.73); moderate-quality evidence]. In addition, the results showed that CDDP was significantly associated with improving retinal hemorrhages [WMD = -0.62, 95% CI (-0.78, -0.46); low-quality evidence], the vision [WMD = 0.14, and 95% CI (0.09, 0.19), low-quality evidence], fundus fluorescence angiography [RR = 0.37 and 95% CI (0.23, 0.60); low-quality evidence], reduction of retinal microaneurysm [WMD = -3.74 and 95% CI (-4.38, -3.11); moderate-quality evidence], hemangioma volume [WMD = -3.15, 95%CI (-3.45, -2.85); moderate-quality evidence], macular thickness [WMD = -5.52, 95%CI = (-64.27, -48.78); low-quality evidence], mean defect [WMD = -1.65 and 95% CI (-1.95, -1.34); very low-quality evidence], fasting blooding glucose [WMD = -0.95, 95% CI (-1.19, -0.70); low-quality evidence), hemoglobin A1c [WMD = -0.62, 95% CI (-0.93, -0.30); low-quality evidence], high sensitive C reaction protein [WMD = -5.66, 95% CI (-8.01, -3.31); low-quality evidence]. Sensitivity, subgroup, and Meta-regression analyses were also assessed. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that CDDP has beneficial clinical effects for treating NPDR and improve the vision. Moreover, it indicated that oral CDDP in NPDR patients led to significant regulation of serum level of fasting blooding glucose, hemoglobin A1c and high sensitive C reaction protein, which was associated with the pathogenesis of NPDR. However, high-quality and large randomized clinical trials will be needed to prove the consequence in future."

The structures of the two new compounds were determined by multiple spectral analyses (UV, IR, HR-ESI-MS, NMR, and ECD). In addition, the absolute configurations were established by chiral analysis and calculated and experimental circular dichroism spectra. Biological research indicated that compound 1 could significantly inhibit the proliferation of isoproterenol (ISO)-treated cardiac fibroblasts (AC16 cells), and MMP9 was found to be the most likely target of compound 1. The protein expression and mRNA levels of MMP9 were increased in ISO-induced AC16 cells, which could be reversed by treatment with compound 1. Furthermore, this treatment could alleviate the migration and activation of ISO-induced cardiac fibroblasts.",

We not only investigated the inhibitory properties of Danshen tablet on rivaroxaban metabolism in rat and human liver microsomes but also evaluated the inhibitory effects of Danshen tablet and its eight active components (dihydrotanshinone I, tanshinone I, tanshinone IIA, cryptotanshinone, danshensu, salvianolic acid A, salvianolic acid B, and salvianolic acid C) on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. The results showed that Danshen tablet potently inhibited the metabolism of rivaroxaban in rat and human liver microsomes. In the CYP inhibition study, we found that dihydrotanshinone I, the active component of Danshen tablet, potently inhibited the activities of rat CYP3A and CYP2J, with IC50 values at 13.85 and 6.39 μM, respectively. In further inhibition kinetic study, we found that Danshen tablet is a mixed inhibitor in rivaroxaban metabolism in rat and human liver microsomes, with the K i value at 0.72 and 0.25 mg/ml, respectively. In conclusion, there is a potential interaction between Danshen tablet and rivaroxaban. Danshen tablet inhibits the metabolism of rivaroxaban, which may be because its lipid-soluble components such as dihydrotanshinone I strongly inhibit the activities of CYP enzymes, especially CYP3A and CYP2J. Therefore, when Danshen tablet and rivaroxaban are used simultaneously in the clinic, it is necessary to strengthen the drug monitoring of rivaroxaban and adjust the dosage."

Danshen zexie decoction (DZD) is a Chinese herbal medicine that is based on zexie decoction and has an effect of regulating lipid mechanism. However, the anti-NAFLD effect and mechanism of DZD remain unclear. In this study, we observed the therapeutic effect of DZD on NAFLD rats and investigated its possible mechanisms. Sixty Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to six groups: control group, model group, Yishanfu (polyene phosphatidylcholine) group, and low, medium and high-dose DZD groups. High-fat diet (HFD) was fed to the rats to establish an NAFLD model, and each treatment group was given corresponding drugs at the same time for eight consecutive weeks. The results revealed that the obvious lipid metabolism disorder and liver injury induced by HFD were alleviated by treatment with DZD, which was verified by decreased serum TC, TG, ALT, AST, liver TC, TG, and FFA, as well as the alleviation of hepatic steatosis. The production of ROS in rats was reduced after treatment with DZD. The SOD activity and GSH content were increased with DZD treatment, while the MDA level was decreased. The administration of DZD could decrease serum IL-1β and IL-18 contents. Moreover, DZD upregulated the expressions of Nrf2, HO-1, GCLC, and GCLM, while it suppressed the expressions of NLRP3, caspase-1, GSDMD, and GSDMD-N. In conclusion, the data showed that DZD can reduce lipid accumulation, alleviate oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibit pyroptosis in NAFLD rats, which might be ascribed to suppression of the ROS/NLRP3/IL-1β signaling pathway by activation of Nrf2. Overall, these results indicated that DZD is expected to be a therapeutic drug for NAFLD."

It can promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis, and is commonly used in the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers, coronary heart disease, angina pectoris, etc. This research is based on network pharmacology and is experimentally verified to explore the potential mechanism of Danshen Decoction in the treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM). METHODS: The effective components and targets of Danshen Decoction were firstly extracted from Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) Database and Analysis Platform, the drug-component-target-disease network was then constructed, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, the Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was carried out, and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway was analyzed in order to find the potential active components and therapeutic mechanisms. Finally, the in vitro hypoxia/reoxygenation model in H9c2 cells was established to verify the predicted active components and therapeutic mechanisms. RESULTS: The results showed that Danshen Decoction has 67 potential active components and 109 therapeutic targets in treating ICM. These targets were rich in a variety of gene functions and different signaling pathways; the main gene targets include TP53, c-Jun, and Akt1. Go enrichment analysis showed that response to drug, membrane raft, and G protein-coupled amine receiver activity rank first in each process, and the main signaling pathways include PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Through molecular docking and experimental verification of the major active components and core therapeutic targets, the active components of Danshen Decoction demonstrated an ability to reduce the cell damage caused by hypoxia/reoxygenation in H9c2 cells by regulating the core therapeutic target including Akt1, c-Jun, and TP53. CONCLUSION: Danshen Decoction has the effect of treating ICM in multiple ways, which is consistent with the results of network pharmacology. This laid a foundation for further study in exploring the active principles and pharmacological mechanism of Danshen Decoction."

The difference in overall therapeutic effects and endogenous metabolic regulation between short- and long-term administration was still unclear. PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the difference in endogenous metabolic regulation between short- and long-term Compound Danshen Dripping Pills (CDDP) administration against acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: The model of AMI was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. The cardiac protection effects of CDDP were investigated by echocardiography, 1- or 2-week were defined as short- and long-term based on desirable efficacy variability. The entire metabolic changes between short- and long-term administration of CDDP were profiled by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. In addition, the metabolic regulatory network of CDDP administration against myocardial infarction rats was also compared with those of a typical chemical drug isosorbide 5-mononitrate (ISMN). RESULTS: After 1- or 2-week continuous oral administration, CDDP could significantly alleviate AMI-induced cardiac dysfunction. By using LC-MS-based metabolomics analyses, we systematically investigated the metabolic profiles of plasma and heart tissue samples at fixed exposure time-points (2 h, 24 h) from AMI rats with CDDP treatment. Most interestingly, global endogenous metabolic changes were observed in cardiac samples collected at different stages post consecutive CDDP administration, fluctuating at 2 and 24 h after 1 week but stabilizing after 2 weeks. The disrupted metabolic pathways such as glycerophospholipid, amino acids, fatty acids, and arachidonic acid metabolism were reconstructed after both short- and long-term CDDP treatment, while taurine and hypotaurine metabolism and purine metabolism contributed to the whole efficacy after long-term CDDP administration. CONCLUSION: Long-term CDDP treatment plays prolonged and stable efficacy against AMI compared with short-term treatment by specifically regulating purine and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism and systematically redressing metabolic disorders.",

Treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors can achieve only partial efficacy on renal function decline and renal fibrosis in CKD patients. Huangqi-Danshen decoction (HDD) is a basic Chinese herbal pair which is commonly used to treat CKD with good efficacy. OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to investigate the effect of perindopril erbumine (PE), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, combined with HDD on adenine-induced CKD rat model and explore the possible mechanism from Sirtuin3/mitochondrial dynamics pathway. METHOD: CKD rat model was established by feeding of 0.75% w/w adenine containing diet for 3 weeks. At the same time, the treatment groups were given PE (0.42 mg/kg/d) or HDD (4.7 g/kg/d) or PE combined with HDD by gavage for 4 weeks. Renal function was evaluated by the levels of serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The renal pathological injury was observed by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Masson's trichrome staining. Proteins expression was determined by Western blot analysis. Mitochondrial morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: PE in combination with HDD significantly improved renal function, reduced tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis in adenine-induced CKD rats. Moreover, PE + HDD treatment mainly activated the Sirtuin3 expression level. In addition, PE + HDD exhibited bidirectional regulation on mitochondrial dynamics by suppressing mitochondrial fission protein dynaminrelated protein 1 expression and elevating mitochondrial fusion protein optic atrophy 1 expression, resulted in restraint of mitochondrial fragmentation. CONCLUSION: The combination of PE and HDD attenuated adenine-induced CKD in rats, which was possibly associated with Sirtuin3/mitochondrial dynamics pathway."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To research the molecular mechanism of compound Danshen tablets in the treatment of hepatic fibrosis through network pharmacology. METHODS: Traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology (TCMSP) and online Mendelian inheritance in man (OMIM) databases were searched for compound Danshen tablets' active ingredients o and hepatic fibrosis-related genes. The network enrichment of the targets of \"herb-compound-target\" was visualized and analyzed using Cytoscape software. Then, the screened target genes were used to construct a protein-protein interaction network. The DAVID enrichment database (the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery) was adopted for GO (Gene Ontology) enrichment and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway enrichment of vital nodes. RESULTS: The results yielded 234 targets of compound Danshen tablets; ten important targets (TNF, IL-10, TGF-β1, EGF, CXCL16, CCL21, SERPINB5, SERPINA1, SOD2, and PPIG) for reversing hepatic fibrosis; and four core targets (TNF, IL-10, TGF-1, and EGF). In addition, KEGG enrichment analysis showed that compound Danshen tablets mainly involved FoxO and MAPK signaling pathways, as the key signaling pathways in the treatment of hepatic fibrosis. CONCLUSION: TNF, IL-10, TGF-1, and EGF and FOXO and MAPK signaling pathways play a key role in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis. Based on the results of this study, the mechanism of action of compound Danshen tablets in the treatment of hepatic fibrosis may be associated with the regulation of FoxO and MAPK signaling pathways and inhibition of TNF, IL-10, TGF-1, and EGF."

The Compound Danshen Dripping Pills (CDDP) is a widely used antianginal drug in China and is shown to significantly alleviate myocardial ischemia. Previous studies showed dose-efficacy tendency when increasing doses of CDDP. This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of intensive doses of CDDP in patients with refractory angina with ICR. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The INCODER study is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled, superiority trial. We plan to recruit 250 patients aged 18-85 years with a diagnosis of refractory angina with ICR. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to intensive treatment group (CDDP 20 pills three times per day) or standard treatment group (10 pills CDDP and 10 pills placebo three times per day). Patients will have a 6-week medication period and be followed up every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint is the change of total exercise time from baseline to week 6 as assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Secondary endpoints include changes in the frequency of angina, Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina class, nitroglycerin use, Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores, peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) and other parameters as measured by CPET, and the levels of plasma C-reactive protein, homocysteine, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. Safety events related to CDDP use will be monitored. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The research had been approved by the Clinical research and laboratory animal ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University ([2019]65). The results will be reported through peer-reviewed journals, seminars, and conference presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: www.chictr.org.cn (ChiCTR2000032384). Registered on 27 April 2020."

In this study, we screened the key pharmacological pathways and targets of CDDP that act on CHD using a network pharmacology-based strategy, and the angiogenic activity of CDDP was directly visually investigated in zebrafish embryos in vivo. METHODS: The potential therapeutic targets and pathways were predicted through a bioinformatics analysis. The proangiogenic effects of CDDP were examined using vascular sprouting assays on subintestinal vessels (SIVs) and optic arteries (OAs) as well as injury assays on intersegmental vessels (ISVs). Pharmacological experiments were applied to confirm the pathway involved. RESULTS: Sixty-five potential therapeutic targets of CDDP on CHD were identified and enriched in the PI3K/AKT and VEGF/VEGFR pathways. An in vivo study revealed that CDDP promoted angiogenesis in SIVs and OAs in a dose-dependent manner and relieved the impairments in ISVs induced by lenvatinib, a VEGF receptor kinase inhibitor (VRI). In addition, Vegfaa and Kdrl expression were significantly upregulated after CDDP treatment. Furthermore, the proangiogenic effect of CDDP could be abolished by PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: CDDP has a proangiogenic effect, the mechanism of which involves the VEGF/VEGFR and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. These results suggest a new insight into the cardiovascular protective effect of CDDP.",

Methods: A network pharmacological analysis was used to study target genes and regulatory networks in the treatment of Salvia miltiorrhiza on AKI. Further experiments with in vivo AKI mouse model and in vitro studies were applied to investigate the renal protective effect of TanIIA in AKI. The mechanisms of TanIIA regulating PXR/NF-κB signaling in renal inflammation were also studied. Results: Network pharmacology had suggested the nuclear receptor family as new therapeutic targets of Salvia miltiorrhiza in AKI treatment. The in vivo studies had demonstrated that TanIIA improved renal function and inflammation by reducing necrosis and promoting the proliferation of tubular epithelial cells. Improved renal arterial perfusion in AKI mice with TanIIA treatment was also recorded by ultrasonography. In vitro studies had shown that TanIIA ameliorated renal inflammation by activating the PXR while inhibiting PXR-mediated NF-κB signaling. The results had suggested a role of PXR activation against AKI-induced renal inflammation. Conclusion: Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Danshen) may protect the kidneys against AKI by regulating nuclear receptors. TanIIA improved cell necrosis proliferation and reduced renal inflammation by upregulating the expression of the PXR and inhibiting NF-κB signaling in a PXR-dependent manner. The PXR may be a potential therapeutic target for AKI treatment."

In clinical cardiovascular, CHD remains as a leading disease that is primarily prevalent among older people and mid-aged groups. CHD has a drastic impact on their life standard, and is known to have debilitating effects on both mental and physical wellbeing. As a Chinese patent medicine, compound Danshen dripping pills (CDDPs) are commonly administered to treat CHD in China. Despite the common intake of CDDPs, there is a lack of evidence-based clinical practice to inform its efficacy and safety through related systematic reviews. Therefore, the present protocol proposes to conduct a meta-analysis aiming to evaluate the effectivity and safeness of using CDDP for treating CHD patients. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials that have evaluated the efficacy and safety of CDDP for treating CHD patients will be searched in MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and WanFang databases. The search will include all related articles published till January 3, 2022. The extracted data will include information on study design, characteristics of the participants, details on intervention, and outcomes. Cochrane risk of bias tool will be employed to assess the quality of the trials. We will use either a random-effects model or fixed-effects model to pool the data. We will present the results as a risk ratio for dichotomous data and weighted mean difference for continuous data. We will visualize publication bias using funnel plots. Disagreements shall be resolved through discussion. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Not required. OSF REGISTRATION NUMBER: 10.17605/OSF.IO/HJTP8.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Compound Danshen Dropping Pills (CDDP) is widely used in clinical treatment of epilepsy. But the underlying active ingredients and molecular mechanisms are unclear. Our study aims to investigate the active components and functional mechanisms of CDDP in treating epilepsy using a network pharmacology approach. METHODS: Candidate constituents and targets of CDDP were searched on the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database. NCBI and Genecards were used to establish a database of epilepsy targets. Next, used Cytoscape software, the interactive network diagram of \"drug-active component-target\" was drawn. Based on the STRING database we constructed protein-protein interaction network and analyzed protein-protein interaction relationships. Gene ontology analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis were performed for the common targets. Molecular docking provided an evaluation tool for verifying the combination of components and targets, which was performed using Auto-dock. RESULTS: Sixty bioactive components, corresponding to 79 therapeutic targets for epilepsy, were successfully identified. Functional enrichment analysis showed that CDDP plays a pharmacological role in the treatment of epilepsy by regulating serotonergic synapses, morphine addiction, nicotine addiction and other pathways, as well as the NF-κB signaling pathway. Molecular docking analysis showed that representative components may be closely bound to key targets. CONCLUSIONS: This network pharmacology study revealed the synergistic effects of multiple components, targets, and pathways of CDDP in the treatment of epilepsy, which will deepen our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of CDDP in the treatment of epilepsy and lay the foundation for further experimental studies."

Although conventional treatments are effective in the management of IBD, high cost and frequent side effects limit their applications and have turned sufferers toward alternative and complementary approaches. Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge (Danshen) is an herbal medicine that reportedly alleviates the symptoms of IBD. A large body of research, including clinical trials in which Danshen-based products or botanical compounds were used, has unmasked its multiple mechanisms of action, but no review has focused on its efficacy as a treatment for IBD. Here, we discussed triggers of IBD, collected relevant clinical trials and analyzed experimental reports, in which bioactive compounds of Danshen attenuated rodent colitis in the management of intestinal integrity, gut microflora, cell death, immune conditions, cytokines, and free radicals. A network pharmacology approach was applied to describe sophisticated mechanisms in a holistic view. The safety of Danshen was also discussed. This review of evidence will help to better understand the potential benefits of Danshen for IBD treatment and provide insights for the development of innovative applications of Danshen."

METHODS: The clinical data of 81 patients with DR admitted to our hospital were analyzed retrospectively, and the patients were divided into an observation group (n=40) and a control group (n=41) in accordance with a random number table. The observation group was treated with CDDPs, while the control group was treated with Captopril. The response rates, change of severity degrees of retinopathy, improvement of vision, incidence of macular edema and symptom scores were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: (1) The ratio of decreasing degree of severity of retinopathy in the observation group was greater than that in the control group, while the ratio of increasing degree of severity of retinopathy in the observation group was lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the constant ratio of degree of severity of retinopathy between the two groups (P > 0.05). (2) After treatment, the scores for dim vision, somber facial complexion, dry eyes, encrusted skin and numbness of the limbs in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). (3) The overall response rates (ORRs) were 87.50% and 63.41% in the observation group and the control group, respectively (P < 0.05). (4) After treatment, the vision in the left and right eye in the observation group was higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). (5) The incidence rates of macular edema were 12.50% and 31.71% in the observation group and the control group, respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CDDPs can effectively elevate the response rate, reduce the degree of severity of retinopathy, mitigate the incidence of macular edema, and improve the vision of DR patients with the syndrome of Qi stagnation and blood stasis, exhibiting a satisfactory safety profile. Therefore, it has a good application value."

OBJECTIVE: To explore the protective effect of CDDP on hypobaric hypoxia (HH) and its possible mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A meta-analysis of 1051 human volunteers was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of CDDP at high altitudes. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into 5 groups (n = 6): control at normal pressure, model, CDDP-170 mg/kg, CDDP-340 mg/kg and acetazolamide groups. HH was simulated at an altitude of 5500 m for 24 h. Animal blood was collected for arterial blood-gas analysis and cytokines detection and their organs were harvested for pathological examination. Expression levels of AQP1, NF-κB and Nrf2 were determined by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: The meta-analysis data indicated that the ratio between the combined RR of the total effective rate and the 95% CI was 0.23 (0.06, 0.91), the SMD and 95% CI of SO2 was 0.37 (0.12, 0.62). Pre-treatment of CDDP protected rats from HH-induced pulmonary edoema and heart injury, left-shifted oxygen-dissociation curve and decreased P50 (30.25 ± 3.72 vs. 37.23 ± 4.30). Mechanistically, CDDP alleviated HH-reinforced ROS by improving SOD and GPX1 while inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-κB expression. CDDP also decreased HH-evoked D-dimer, erythrocyte aggregation and blood hemorheology, promoting AQP1 and Nrf2 expression. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Pre-treatment with CDDP could prevent HH-induced tissue damage, oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Suppressed NF-κB and up-regulated Nrf2 might play significant roles in the mechanism of CDDP.",

METHODS: The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm was optimized first and compared with other algorithms for the accuracy and stability in separation of blood flow signals. 80 patients with PIH syndrome undergoing ultrasound examination were selected as the research subjects and randomly divided into control group and observation group according to the actual treatment methods. 40 cases in the observation group were treated with Compound Danshen injection + magnesium sulfate, and 40 cases in the control group were treated with magnesium sulfate. After the treatment, the clinical indicators of the two groups of patients were analyzed. RESULTS: The accuracy and stability in separating blood flow signal of the optimized EMD algorithm were better than those of other algorithms. After treatment, the total effective rate and blood pressure control of the observation group were significantly better than those of the control group, and the incidence of adverse maternal and infant outcomes was significantly lower than that of the control group. After treatment, the endothelin-1 (ET-1), C-reactive protein (CRP), and homocysteine (Hcy) indexes of the two groups of patients decreased significantly, and the decrease level of the observation group was significantly greater than that of the control group (P < 0.05). The prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen (FIB), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and plasma thrombin time (TT) levels of the two groups after treatment were better than those before treatment, and the observation group was better than the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The optimized EMD algorithm is of great value for the separation of ultrasound blood flow signals. For patients with PIH syndrome, Compound Danshen injection combined with magnesium sulfate can be used as a treatment plan, which can improve maternal and infant outcomes; control blood pressure; reduce 24 h urine protein and serum ET-1, Hcy, and CRP levels; and improve coagulation function.

      "abstract": "Danshen-Chuanxiongqin Injection (DCI) is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of cerebral ischemic stroke in China. However, its underlying mechanisms remain completely understood. The current study was designed to explore the protective mechanisms of DCI against cerebral ischemic stroke through integrating whole-transcriptome sequencing coupled with network pharmacology analysis. First, using a mouse model of cerebral ischemic stroke by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), we found that DCI (4.10 mL·kg-1) significantly alleviated cerebral ischemic infarction, neurological deficits, and the pathological injury of hippocampal and cortical neurons in mice. Next, the whole-transcriptome sequencing was performed on brain tissues. The cerebral ischemia disease (CID) network was constructed by integrating transcriptome sequencing data and cerebrovascular disease-related genes. The results showed CID network was imbalanced due to tMCAO, but a recovery regulation was observed after DCI treatment. Pathway analysis of the key genes with recovery efficiency showed that the neuroinflammation signaling pathway was highly enriched, while the TLR2/TLR4-MyD88-NF-κB pathway was predicted to be affected. Consistently, the in vivo validation experiments confirmed that DCI exhibited protective effects against cerebral ischemic stroke by inhibiting neuroinflammation via the TLR2/TLR4-MyD88-NF-κB pathway. More interestingly, DCI markedly suppressed the neutrophils infiltrated into the brain parenchyma via the choroid plexus route and showed anti-neuroinflammation effects. In conclusion, our results provide dependable evidence that inhibiting neuroinflammation via the TLR2/TLR4-MyD88-NF-κB pathway is the main mechanism of DCI against cerebral ischemic stroke in mice.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Danshen, the dried rhizome of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge., is widely used to treat cardio-cerebrovascular diseases in China. However, its role in nourishing blood, which has been detailed in historical literature for thousands of years, is perpetually disputed in the academic field. Moreover, there is no systematic research on Danshen in treating anemia. This research aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of Danshen on anemia in a zebrafish model based on the results of a network pharmacology study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The network pharmacology study was based on the screening of chemical components and related targets from TCMSP and SwissADME database. The genes associated with anemia were obtained from DisgeNet database, and the genes with the intersection of Danshen target genes were screened out. The Cytoscape 3.7.2 software package was used to construct the \"ingredient-target-pathway\" network. The exploration of target interaction by String system and the enrichment analysis by Metascape system, was used to discover the possible anti-anemia action mechanism of Danshen. Then, a zebrafish anemia model was induced by vinorelbine followed by the administration of aqueous/ethanol extract of Danshen in contrast to SiWu Decoction (SWD), which is generally acknowledged as a positive drug for tonifying blood. Afterward, the red blood cell signal, cardiac output, and blood flow velocity were detected to evaluate their blood-enriching effects. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to analyze the mRNA levels of hematopoietic-related factors, which were predicted in network pharmacology. RESULTS: Compounds and target screening hinted that 115 chemical targets from Danshen were related to anemia, KEGG pathway enrichment results suggested that the mechanism of Danshen in treating anemia was significantly related to the Jak-STAT signaling pathway. Pharmacodynamic results showed that aqueous extract of Danshen (DSAE) and ethanol extract of Danshen (DSEE) markedly enhanced the number of red blood cells, cardiac output, and blood flow velocity. Compared with DSAE, DSEE exerted anti-anemia effects at a lower dose; however, along with higher toxicity. PCR data demonstrated that DSAE and DSEE treatment both upregulated the mRNA expression of erythroid hematopoiesis-related factors in the Epo-JAK-STAT signaling pathway, such as Gata-1, Epo, EpoR, Jak2, STAT3, and STAT5. In general, DSAE exhibited higher activation of this signaling than DSEE. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that DSAE and DSEE both possess blood-enriching functions related with their ability to promote Jak-STAT signaling. DSAE exerted lower toxicity and attenuated anemia over a wider dose range than DSEE, which suggests that DSAE may be more suitable for the treatment for anemia. These results presented experimental evidence for the clinical use of Danshen as an intervention for anemia, especially in chemotherapy-induced anemia.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Dahuang Danshen decoction (DD) is used to treat pancreatic fibrosis. Pancreatic fibrosis is a typical manifestation of chronic pancreatitis (CP), which affects the digestive system. The therapeutic mechanisms of DD in pancreatic fibrosis are unclear. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of DD on oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress in CP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experimental rats were intraperitoneally injected with 500 mg/kg BW of diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) twice a week for six weeks to induce CP. At the same time, DD was administered orally at daily doses of 1.37 g/kg BW, 2.74 g/kg BW, and 5.48 g/kg BW to evaluate its treatment effects on CP. After all treatments, pancreatic tissues were harvested and subjected to H&E staining. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also performed to show the endoplasmic reticulum structure in the pancreatic tissues. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the α-SMA expression level in the pancreatic tissues. Metabolomics analysis of the serum and proteomics analysis of the pancreatic tissues were performed to reveal the changes of endogenous metabolites and proteins, respectively. Concentrations of GSH, MDA, SOD, ROS, col-1, and col-3 were determined using corresponding kits. The western blotting method was used to determine the protein levels of Keap-1, HO-1, NQO1, Nrf2, GRP, JNK, and caspase 12. The pancreatic mRNA levels of NQO1, GPX1, HO-1, GST-π, GRP, JNK, and caspase 12 were also determined by quantitative PCR. The interactions between TCM components and Keap-1 were investigated by molecular docking modeling. RESULTS: The pathohistological results demonstrated that DD could ameliorate DDC-induced CP in vivo, indicated by reduction of α-SMA, col-1, col-3, TNF-α, and IL-6. DD increased serum levels of GSH and SOD but reduced pancreatic ROS. DD decreased cytoplasmic Keap-1 and increased Nrf2 nuclear localization. Correspondingly, DD increased the expression levels of Nrf2 downstream antioxidant genes NQO1, GPX1, HO-1, and GST-π. DD also decreased ERS hallmarks caspase 12 cleavage and GRP expression. Eventually, DD inhibited PSC activation by reducing JNK phosphorylation and MMK-3/p38 expression. Molecular docking analysis showed that salvianolic acid B and emodin had a good binding affinity toward Keap-1. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that DD could ameliorate the oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress through releasing Nrf2 from Keap-1 binding and inducing the downstream antioxidant enzymes. As a result, DD could thwart pancreatic fibrosis by inhibiting PSCs activation, which was induced by OS and ERS through JNK and MMK3/p38 pathways."

Chen and Borneol, is a famous traditional Chinese medicine formula which has made great achievements in the treatment of ischemic heart disease, but the profound mechanism of CDDP improving post ischemic myocardial inflammation hasn't been clearly discussed. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to explore the biological mechanism of constituents in CDDP synergistically improving post ischemic myocardial inflammation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pharmacologic studies were applied to assess the cardio protection effect of CDDP in acute myocardial ischemic rats. To identify the anti-inflammatory ingredients in CDDP, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry combined with a dual-luciferase reporter assay for NF-κB inhibition were used. The network pharmacology and molecular docking assay were adopted to predict targets of anti-inflammatory ingredients and then the regulation effects of these active components on their targets were also verified. RESULTS: Our results indicated that CDDP exerted an excellent cardio protection effect by reversing echocardiographic abnormalities, attenuating histopathological lesion, ameliorating circulating myocardial markers and inflammation cytokines. Tanshinol, salvianolic acid B (Sal B), tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) and notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1) were the pivotal anti-inflammatory ingredients in CDDP. The anti-inflammatory mechanism is that tanshinol and Sal B respectively targeted on PPARγ and JNK, while Tan IIA worked on AKT1 and NGR1 bound to PI3K. CONCLUSIONS: Our results firstly demonstrated that CDDP effectively ameliorated post ischemic myocardial inflammation through simultaneously modulating MAPK, PI3K/AKT and PPAR pathways in a multi-components synergetic manner.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical curative effect of compound Danshen injection on acute cerebral infarction (ACI) patients and its impact on the CRP, D-dimer, and IL-6 levels. METHODS: 116 patients with ACI admitted to our hospital were randomly placed in an observation group (n=58) or a control group (n=58). The control group received rosuvastatin tablets (10 mg/time, qd) in addition to the standard treatment. The observation group received compound Danshen injection in addition to the standard treatment. The treatment continued for 21 days. The clinical treatment efficacy, the CRP, D-dimer, and IL-6 levels, the NIHSS scores (to evaluate the degree of neurological impairment), the Fugl-Meyer scores (to access patients' motor function), the ADL scores, the sleep quality (the PSQI and AIS scores), and the complication incidence rates were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: After the treatment, the effective rate in the observation group (89.66%) was significantly higher than it was in the control group (74.14%) (P<0.05). After the treatment, the serum CRP, D-dimer, and IL-6 levels in the two groups were lower than they were before the treatment, and the levels were lower in the observation group than they were in the control group (all P<0.05). After the treatment, the NIHSS scores in the observation group were lower than they were in the control group, and the Fugl-Meyer and ADL scores were higher than they were in the control group (all P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the PSQI and AIS scores in the observation group were lower than they were in the control group after the treatment (P<0.05). The severe diarrhea, bedsore, urinary tract infection, liver and kidney function injury, skin allergic reactions and other total adverse reaction incidence rates in the observation group were lower than they were in the control group. CONCLUSION: Rosuvastatin combined with compound Danshen injection is effective in ACI treatment. It is able to effectively improve the clinical symptoms, reduce the incidence of complications, improve the recovery of the IL-6, CRP, and D-dimer levels and enhance patients' sleep quality."

      "abstract": "With the increased incidence and recognition, ulcerative colitis (UC) has become a global public health problem in the world. Although many immunosuppressant and biological drugs have been used for UC treatment, the cure rate is still very low. It is necessary to find some safe and long-term used medicine for UC cure. Recently, the Chinese traditional herb Danshen has been investigated in the treatment of UC. However, it is a limitation of Danshen that many of the active components in Danshen are not easily absorbed by the human body. Probiotics could convert macromolecules into smaller molecules to facilitate absorption. Thus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus (F-B4-1) and Bacillus subtillis Natto (F-A7-1) were screened to ferment Danshen in this study. The fermented Danshen products were gavaged in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC model mice. Danshen had better results to attenuate symptoms of DSS-induced UC after fermented with F-B4-1 and F-A7-1. Loss of body weight and disease activity index (DAI) were reduced. The abnormally short colon lengths and colonic damage were recovered. And fermented Danshen had the better inhibitory effect than Danshen itself on pro-inflammatory cytokine expression during DSS-induced UC. The results indicated that compared with Danshen, fermented Danshen relieved DSS-induced UC in mice more effectively. Danshen fermented by probiotics might be an effective treatment to UC in clinic stage in the future.",

Compound DanShen Dripping Pill (CDDP) is a widely used Traditional Chinese Medicine for cardiovascular disease treatment. Herein, we investigated if CDDP can protect mice against doxorubicin (DOX) or isoprenaline (ISO)-induced HF. After 3 days feeding of normal chow containing CDDP, mice were started DOX or ISO treatment for 4 weeks or 18 days. At the end of treatment, mice were conducted electrocardiogram and echocardiographic test. Blood and heart samples were determined biochemical parameters, myocardial structure and expression of the related molecules. CDDP normalized DOX/ISO-induced heart weight changes, HF parameters and fibrogenesis. The DOX/ISO-impaired left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening were restored by CDDP. Mechanistically, CDDP blocked DOX/ISO-inhibited expression of antioxidant enzymes and DOX/ISO-induced expression of pro-fibrotic molecules, inflammation and cell apoptosis. Additional DOX/ISO-impaired targets in cardiac function but protected by CDDP were identified by RNAseq, qRT-PCR and Western blot. In addition, CDDP protected cardiomyocytes against oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced injuries. Taken together, our study shows that CDDP can protect against myocardial injuries in different models, suggesting its potential application for HF treatment.",

      "abstract": "Background: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common diseases in clinical cardiovascular practice, mainly afflicting the middle-aged and elderly. It will greatly affect elderly quality of life, and even affect their psychological and physical health. At present, CHD is treated with western drugs alone, but this can produce drug dependency. In recent years, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) combine western drugs has been used as a complementary and alternative therapy, and its effectiveness and safety have been proven, attracting the attention of numerous researchers. Objective: Our study aimed to compare the efficacy of Aspirin with Combined Compound Danshen Dropping Pills had a superior effect on the treatment of Hemorheology and Blood Lipids in Middle-aged and Elderly Patients with CHD. Determine the effectiveness and safety of Aspirin with Combined Compound Danshen Dropping Pills in the treatment of CHD, and obtain high quality clinical evidence. Methods: Based on the PRISMA Statement, inclusion and exclusion criteria were formulated. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the Effects of Aspirin with Combined Compound Danshen Dropping Pills on Hemorheology and Blood Lipids in Middle-aged and Elderly Patients with CHD were found following a search of 4 mainstream medical databases. RCTs found to meet the study's requirement were included; data information was then extracted, and the quality assessed using the Cochrane bias risk assessment tool. Through RevMan software, Meta analysis was carried out for overall TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C hematocrit, high shear viscosity, low shear viscosity, plasma viscosity, PAGM, and TXB2 effective rate. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated; heterogeneity was tested and its source found; publication bias was assessed through the Egger and Begg tests, and by means of funnel plots. Result: 22 RCTs were found, involving 1,987 cases. The results of the Meta analysis showed that, compared to drug therapy alone, Aspirin with Combined Compound Danshen Dropping Pills had a superior effect on the treatment of Hemorheology and Blood Lipids in Middle-aged and Elderly Patients with CHD. The meta analysis results show the effects on TC [MD = -0.91, 95% CI (-1.09, -0.73)], on TG [MD = -0.94, 95% CI (-1.22, -0.66)], on HDL-C [MD = 0.40, 95% CI (0.27, 0.53)], on LDL-C [MD = -0.99, 95% CI (-1.24, -0.74)], on hematocrit [MD = -2.69, 95% CI (-3.73, -1.65)], on high shear blood viscosity [MD = -1.11, 95% CI (-2.18, -0.05)], on low shear viscosity [MD = -0.79, 95% CI (-0.89, -0.68)], on plasma viscosity [MD = -0.26, 95% CI (-0.52, 0.01)], on PAMG [MD = -10.75, 95% CI (-16.84, -4.67)], and on TXB2 [MD = -11.84, 95% CI (-14.75, -8.92)]. The source of heterogeneity might be related to the state of patient, efficacy of drugs in the control group and difference in judgment criteria for efficacy. The Egger test and Begg test showed that publication bias did not occur in our study. Conclusions: The combination of compound dropping pill DSP with aspirin has some therapeutic effect on blood lipids and hemorheology in patients with CHD, ince some of the RCTs featured a very small sample size, the reliability and validity of our study's conclusion may have been affected as well; therefore, the explanation should be treated with some caution. In the future, a large number of higher-quality RCTs are still needed to confirm the results of our study.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Danshen water extract (DWE), obtained from the Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Family Lamiaceae) root, is usually employed in Chinese traditional medicine as treatment to cardiovascular ailments and cerebrovascular diseases. Intriguingly, the extract was also found to contain vast beneficial properties in Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. AIM OF THE STUDY: Alzheimer's disease is the most significant type of neurodegenerative disorder plaguing societies globally. Its pathogenesis encompasses the hallmark aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ). Of all the Aβ oligomers formed in the brain, Aβ42 is the most toxic and aggressive. Despite this, the mechanism behind this disease remains elusive. In this study, DWE, and its major components, Salvianolic acid A (SalA) and Salvianolic acid B (SalB) were tested for their abilities to attenuate Aβ42's toxic effects. METHODS: The composition of DWE was determined via Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC). DWE, SalA and SalB were first verified for their capability to diminish Aβ42 fibrillation using an in vitro activity assay. Since Aβ42 aggregation results in neuronal degeneration, the potential Aβ42 inhibitors were next evaluated on Aβ42-exposed PC12 neuronal cells. The Drosophila melanogaster AD model was then employed to determine the effects of DWE, SalA and SalB. RESULTS: DWE, SalA and SalB were shown to be able to reduce fibrillation of Aβ42. When tested on PC12 neuronal cells, DWE, SalA and SalB ameliorated cells from cell death associated with Aβ42 exposure. Next, DWE and its components were tested on the Drosophila melanogaster AD model and their rescue effects were further characterized. The UPLC analysis showed that SalA and SalB were present in the brains and bodies of Drosophila after DWE feeding. When human Aβ42 was expressed, the AD Drosophila exhibited degenerated eye structures known as the rough eye phenotype (REP), reduced lifespan and deteriorated locomotor ability. Administration of DWE, SalA and SalB partially reverted the REP, increased the age of AD Drosophila and improved most of the mobility of AD Drosophila. CONCLUSION: Collectively, DWE and its components may have therapeutic potential for AD patients and possibly other forms of brain diseases.",

      "abstract": "Danshen (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae) and Honghua (Flos Carthami) (Danhong) are two drugs commonly prescribed together, which are often used in the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases in China. Due to the complexity of the ingredients of Danhong, the present study focused on performing the orthogonal compatibility method on the primary effective molecules of this drug: Tanshinol, salvianolic acid A, salvianolic acid B and hydroxysafflor yellow A. These four molecules were studied to determine their protective effects and to screen for the most compatible ingredients to improve cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (IR) in rats. Focal middle cerebral artery occlusion was performed to establish the cerebral IR model in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham operation group, IR group and nine orthogonal administration groups with different ratios of Danhong effective ingredients and Danhong injection group. Neurological deficit score and cerebral infarction volume were measured postoperatively. Morphological pathological alterations were observed via H&E staining. Bcl-2 and Bax were quantified using ELISA. Immunohistochemistry was conducted to analyze the expression of caspase-3 in the hippocampus. The expression levels of cytochrome c, apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 (apaf-1), caspase-9, caspase-3 and p53 mRNA in the hippocampus were assessed via reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. The results demonstrated that different compatibility groups significantly reduced the neurological function score and decreased the volume of cerebral infarct compared with the IR group. These groups were also indicated to improve the pathological damage to the brain tissue. In addition, certain compatibility groups significantly decreased the number of caspase-3 positive cells in the hippocampus and the expression levels of cytochrome c, apaf-1, caspase-9, caspase-3 and p53 mRNA in the brain tissue. Orthogonal group 4 (30 mg/kg tanshinol; 2.5 mg/kg salvianolic acid A; 16 mg/kg salvianolic acid B; 8 mg/kg hydroxysafflor yellow A) was indicated to be the most effective. The four effective ingredients of Danhong exhibited a protective effect on rats with cerebral IR injury, potentially through the inhibition of apoptosis via the downregulation of key targets upstream of the caspase-3 pathway. In addition, the present study provided novel insights for the continued study of the drug compatibility rules of TCM."

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Fufang Danshen Tablet (FDT) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula composed of three Chinese medicinal materials comprising Salviae Miltiorrhizar Radix et Rhizoma (Dan-Shen in Chinese), Notoginseng Radix et Rhizoma (San-Qi), and Borneolum Syntheticum (Bing-Pian). It has been documented to exert significant effects in promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis, and become a frequently used formula in the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. AIM OF THE REVIEW: To systematically analyze and summarize the research findings concerning the chemical composition, quality control, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological properties, clinical applications, and toxicity of FDT, so as to point out some typical problems and provides opinions for future study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literatures involving FDT were collected from online scientific databases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang Data, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, Springer Link, SciFinder, and Google Scholar up to March 2021. All eligible studies are analyzed and summarized in this review. RESULTS: This review summarizes reported results concerning the post-marketing quality and efficacy of FDT. Some problems are pointed out for FDT. Hereon we propose several directions for future study: (a) improvement of quality control based on exact overall chemical profiles, entire production process monitoring, and biopotency-associated multi-index content determination method; (b) clarification of functional mechanisms focused on pharmacokinetic profiles in human, interplay with gut microbiota, and integration of multi-omics technologies; (c) reconfirmation of clinical effectiveness and safety from large-scale clinical studies based on evidence-based medicine. CONCLUSIONS: FDT is a typical TCM formula in treating cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, but there are also some troubles. Future studies should focus on the improvement of quality control, the clarification of functional mechanisms, as well as the reconfirmation of clinical effectiveness and safety.",

China National Knowledge Infrastructure(CNKI), Wanfang, VIP, PubMed, EMbase, Cochrane Library, Ovid and Web of Science databases were searched by computer to retrieve the randomized controlled trials(RCTs) of Compound Danshen Dripping Pills combined with conventional antihypertensive drugs in the treatment of hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy from the establishment of databases to July 2020. After two researchers performed data retrieval, data extraction, and risk assessment of bias, they used RevMan 5.3 software for Meta-analysis. A total of 10 RCTs were included, with a total of 979 patients. Meta-analysis results showed that in terms of interventricular septal thickness(MD=-0.70, 95%CI[-1.15,-0.24], P=0.003), left ventricular posterior wall thickness(MD=-0.81, 95%CI[-1.41,-0.21], P=0.008), left ventricular mass index(MD=-8.75, 95%CI[-17.40,-0.10], P=0.05), systolic blood pressure(MD=-8.97, 95%CI[-13.46,-4.48], P&lt;0.000 1), diastolic blood pressure(MD=-5.87, 95%CI[-8.39,-3.34], P&lt;0.000 01) and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter(MD=-1.73, 95%CI[-2.38,-1.08], P&lt;0.000 01), Compound Danshen Dripping Pills combined with conventional antihypertensive drugs was superior to conventional antihypertensive drugs. In terms of left ventricular ejection fraction(MD=0.41, 95%CI[-0.74, 1.55], P=0.49), there was no statistical difference in treatment between the two groups. Because of the small amount of literatures included in the safety aspect, it is impossible to give an accurate conclusion. The GRADE score showed that the level of evidence was low and extremely low. The results show that the Compound Danshen Dripping Pills combined with conventional antihypertensive drugs may effectively improve the clinical efficacy for hypertensive ventricular hypertrophy, and the safety needs to be further explored. Due to the low quality of the included literatures, more high-quality RCTs are needed for verification.",

      "abstract": "The incidence of cerebral ischemic stroke characterized by high mortality is increasing every year. Danshen Chuanxiongqin Injection (DSCXQ), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) preparation, is often applied to treat cerebral apoplexy and its related sequelae. However, there is a lack of systematic research on how DSCXQ mediates its protective effects against cerebral ischemia stroke. Metabolomic analysis based on UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS was employed to explore the potential mechanisms of DSCXQ on ischemic stroke induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Pattern analysis and metabolomic profiling, combined by multivariate analysis disclosed that 55 differential metabolites were identified between Sham group and Model group, involving sphingolipid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, primary bile acid biosynthesis, pantothenate and CoA synthesis and valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis pathways. DSCXQ could reverse brain metabolic deviations in stroke by significantly upregulating the levels of L-tryptophan, Lyso (18:0/0:0), LPC (18:2), Indole-3-methyl acetate, and downregulating the levels of sphinganine 1-phosphate, L-threonic acid, glutaconic acid and N6,N6,N6-Trimethyl-L-lysine. In our study, we focused on the neuroprotective effects of DSCXQ against neuroinflammatory responses and neuronal apoptosis on a stroke model based on sphingolipid metabolism. The expressions of Sphk1, S1PR1, CD62P, Bcl-2, Bax, and cleaved Caspase-3 in brain tissue were evaluated. The neurological deficit, cerebral infarct size and behavioral abnormality were estimated. Results showed that DSCXQ intervention significantly reduced cerebral infarct size, ameliorated behavioral abnormality, inhibited the expression of Sphk1, S1PR1, CD62P, Bax, Cleaved Caspase-3, while increased the level of Bcl-2, and prevented neuronal apoptosis. The limitations are that our study mainly focused on the verification of sphingolipid metabolism pathway in stroke, and while other metabolic pathways left unverified. Our study indicates that SphK1-SIP axis may potentiate neuroinflammatory responses and mediate brain damage through neuronal apoptosis, and DSCXQ could suppress the activity of SphK1-SIP axis to protect brain tissue in cerebral ischemia. In conclusion, this study facilitates our understanding of metabolic changes in ischemia stroke and the underlying mechanisms related to the clinical application of DSCXQ."
