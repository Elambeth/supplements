      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately 30 % of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) respond to ketamine; however, no replicable predictors of response have been reported. The imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmissions may be implicated in the mechanism of action of ketamine. This study aimed to evaluate whether the ratio of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) to GABA levels at baseline in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) could predict ketamine response in patients with TRD. METHOD: This exploratory study analyzed data from a double-blind randomized clinical trial with an open-label extension study (jRCTs031210124). Fifteen participants in the ketamine group and 15 of 16 participants in the placebo group received repeated intravenous ketamine during the double-blind and open-label extension periods, respectively. We measured Glx and GABA levels in the dACC before and after treatment during the double-blind period using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) was measured for depressive symptomatology. General linear models were used to examine the relationship between baseline Glx/GABA ratio and HDRS-17 score changes. RESULT: Changes in HDRS-17 scores (mean (±SD)) following ketamine treatment were -4.9 (6.5) and -4.9 (5.2) in the double-blind and open-label periods, respectively. A higher baseline dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater improvement in HDRS-17 (β = -0.42, p = 0.040). In the ketamine group, a reduction in the dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater HDRS-17 improvement (β = 0.74, p = 0.009) with no such association in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the dACC may predict the efficacy of ketamine in TRD."

STUDY DESIGN: Patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiochemotherapy (RCT) were randomized into two groups: group A, patients that received PBM + POCP (n = 24), and group B, patients that received PBM + POCP + L-G + HA (n = 24). OM was assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and World Health Organization (WHO) scales. The impact of oral health on patients' quality of life and perception of OM symptoms was evaluated. Assessments were made at the 1st, 7th, 14th, 21st, and 30th radiotherapy (RT) sessions. RESULTS: When the severity of OM was assessed according to the WHO scale in the 30th RT, group B showed lower rates of severe OM than group A. There were no differences when using the NCI scale. The impact of oral health on quality of life and the symptoms reported by patients were lower in group B at all times evaluated. CONCLUSION: The combination of PBM + POCP + L-G + HA resulted in a significantly lower severity of OM than PBM + POCP alone, according to the WHO scale at the 30th RT.

      "abstract": "Tumor metabolic reprogramming is a highly complex process that enables tumor survival in the presence of limited nutrients, involving multiple signaling pathways, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), and transcription factors. Lately, glutamine has been found to enhance the growth, spread, and drug resistance of cancer cells, while also fostering an immunosuppressive microenvironment that aids tumor development. However, in some tumors, such as pancreatic cancer and melanoma, additional glutamine can inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, and this mechanism is closely related to the regulation of the immune microenvironment. Therefore, further exploration of glutamine metabolism in tumors is essential for understanding the pathogenesis of cancer and for developing new metabolically targeted therapies. We systematically review the latest research on the reprogramming of glutamine metabolism and its role of tumor growth, spread, and immune system regulation. Additionally, we review the clinical research progress on targeted glutamine therapies and their application in combination with current anti-tumor treatments. Ultimately, we address the challenges and prospects involved in resistance to anti-cancer strategies aimed at glutamine metabolism.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adults above age 65 face higher risk of both Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) and dementia. CDI in the elderly may exacerbate functional and cognitive impairments. Current CDI treatment options are limited. Alanyl-glutamine (AQ) is a dipeptide shown to decrease C. difficile toxin effects in vitro and in vivo. OBJECTIVE: We tested the potential benefits of AQ on the clinical outcomes and cognitive impairment in the aged mouse model of CDI treated at various timings of AQ and vancomycin treatment. METHODS: C57BL/6 retired breeder (9 months) and aged (18 months) mice were treated with AQ-supplemented water as a two-week pretreatment or continuously. The mice underwent a standard CDI protocol (VPI10463) and treated, or not, with vancomycin. Disease severity was tracked for 14 days, then Novel Object Recognition (NOR) tests for acute memory were performed. Hippocampal tissues were assayed for molecular markers. RESULTS: NOR testing confirmed CDI-induced cognitive impairment (p=0.0352). AQ pretreatment had mild neuroprotective effects during CDI. Mice treated with vancomycin and continuous AQ had better clinical scores and better memory performance than vancomycin controls (p=0.0286). Continuous AQ treatment, when used alone or paired with vancomycin, offered protection against CDI-induced cognitive impairment. The mechanism of CDI-induced memory impairment remains unclear, but infected mice had elevated synaptobrevin-2 (p=0.0396) and NCAM (p=0.008) compared to uninfected controls on day 14 post-infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that neuroinflammation and memory loss occur during CDI that may be ameliorated by AQ supplementation. AQ supplementation may have both neurological and intestinal protective effects during CDI treatment."

      "abstract": "Radiation-induced alterations in the tumor microenvironment (TME) may cause the shift of a few immune cells to immunosuppressive phenotypes, resulting in tumor radiotherapy resistance. The current study is aimed at investigating the impact of radiation on the polarization of glioma-associated macrophages (GAMs) and elucidating the underlying mechanisms. Through the irradiation (IR) of macrophages co-cultured with glioma cells and murine gliomas, we observed that IR promoted the polarization of GAMs towards a pro-tumorigenic M2 phenotype by modulating STAT5 to upregulate and activate glutamine synthetase (GS), consequently fostering glioma cells proliferation, migration, and invasion. Conversely, inhibition of GS activity with L-Methionine Sulfoximine (MSO) could shift macrophages towards the anti-tumor M1 phenotype. Moreover, in murine orthotopic glioma models, the combined treatment of MSO and radiation therapy exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on glioma growth. The combination also led to the suppression of tumor vasculature, increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells, and enhanced tumor cells apoptosis. In summary, our findings suggested that radiation combined with GS inhibition might potentially be a novel therapeutic strategy for glioma by modulating macrophage polarization and further promoting anti-tumor immunity.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Liver fibrosis is a crucial condition for evaluating the prognosis of chronic liver disease. Lectin-1ike oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) has been shown potential research value and therapeutic targeting possibilities in different fibrotic diseases. However, the role of LOX-1 and the underlying mechanisms in liver fibrosis progression remain unclear. METHODS: LOX-1 expression was detected in liver tissues from patients and rodents with liver fibrosis. LOX-1 knockout rats were subjected to CCl4 or methionine and choline-deficient diet (MCD) to induce liver fibrosis. Transcriptomic and metabolomics analysis were used to investigate the involvement and mechanism of LOX-1 on liver fibrosis. RESULTS: We found that LOX-1 exacerbated liver fibrosis by promoting hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation. LOX-1 deletion reversed the development of liver fibrosis. We further verified that LOX-1 drove liver fibrosis by reprogramming glutamine metabolism through mediating isoform switching of glutaminase (GLS). Mechanistically, we revealed the crucial role of the LOX-1/OCT1/GLS1 axis in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. Moreover, LOX-1 rewired ammonia metabolism by regulating glutamine metabolism-urea cycle to drive the progression of liver fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings uncover the pivotal role of LOX-1 in the progression of liver fibrosis, enrich the pathological significance of LOX-1 regulation of hepatic ammonia metabolism, and provide an insight into promising targets for the therapeutic strategy of liver fibrosis, demonstrating the potential clinical value of targeting LOX-1 in antifibrotic therapy."

      "abstract": "Inhibiting glutamine metabolism has been proposed as a potential treatment strategy for improving non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, effective methods for assessing dynamic metabolic responses during interventions targeting glutaminolysis have not yet emerged. Here, we developed a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging platform using l-[5-11C]glutamine ([11C]Gln) and evaluated its efficacy in NASH mice undergoing metabolic therapy with bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES), a glutaminase 1 (GLS1) inhibitor that intervenes in the first and rate-limiting step of glutaminolysis. PET imaging with [11C]Gln effectively delineated the pharmacokinetics of l-glutamine, capturing its temporal-spatial pattern of action within the body. Furthermore, [11C]Gln PET imaging revealed a significant increase in hepatic uptake in methionine and choline deficient (MCD)-fed NASH mice, whereas systemic therapeutic interventions with BPTES reduced the hepatic avidity of [11C]Gln in MCD-fed mice. This reduction in [11C]Gln uptake correlated with a decrease in GLS1 burden and improvements in liver damage, indicating the efficacy of BPTES in mitigating NASH-related metabolic abnormalities. These results suggest that [11C]Gln PET imaging can serve as a noninvasive diagnostic platform for whole-body, real-time tracking of responses of glutaminolysis to GLS1 manipulation in NASH, and it may be a valuable tool for the clinical management of patients with NASH undergoing glutaminolysis-based metabolic therapy."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Age-related osteoporosis complicates rotator cuff tear (RCT) treatment, undermining the integrity of surgical anchor fixation during rotator cuff repair (RCR). This study aimed to investigate whether supplementation with glutamine, an intrinsic amino acid crucial in cell metabolism, can enhance rotator cuff healing by ameliorating age-associated osteoporosis. METHODS: Forty-eight female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: (1) young control (sham surgery), (2) aged control (sham surgery), (3) aged-RCT (RCR with fibrin), and (4) aged-RCT-Gln (RCR with glutamine-enriched fibrin). RCR was performed bilaterally on rats in the RCT groups, with subsequent application of the respective fibrin gel at the tendon-bone interface. Evaluations included micro-computed tomography (CT) for bone quality, histology and immunohistochemistry for tissue integrity, and biomechanical testing for tendon-bone complex strength. RESULTS: Micro-CT revealed worse bone quality at the proximal humerus in the aged rats compared with the young rats, confirming spontaneous osteoporosis occurring with age. Glutamine supplementation improved bone quality in the aged-RCT-Gln group compared with the aged-RCT group, with significantly higher mean bone volume/total volume fraction (BV/TV) (28.69% ± 3.1% compared with 21.13% ± 3.9%), trabecular number (Tb.N) (1.88 ± 0.18 compared with 1.55 ± 0.21 mm-1), and trabecular thickness (Tb.th) (0.15 ± 0.03 compared with 0.12 ± 0.02 mm) and lower trabecular separation (Tb.sp) (0.19 ± 0.03 compared with 0.22 ± 0.03 mm). Histological and immunohistological analysis demonstrated enhanced bone regeneration and a more organized tendon-cartilage-bone interface in the aged-RCT-Gln group. Biomechanical analysis also revealed a more resilient tendon-bone complex after glutamine supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporosis occurred spontaneously at the proximal humerus with age. Glutamine supplementation effectively mitigated age-related osteoporosis and enhanced RCR in elderly rats. These findings support the potential of glutamine, the most abundant amino acid in the body, as a valuable therapeutic intervention for improving RCT outcomes in the aging population, warranting further investigation in clinical settings. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Glutamine supplementation may be a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance RCR in elderly patients with osteoporosis."

Moreover, amino acids and their metabolites have immunoregulatory properties, significantly affecting the behavior of immune cells. Immunotherapy is one of the oncological treatment methods that improves cytotoxic properties of one's own immune system. Thus, enzymes catalyzing amino acid metabolism, together with metabolites themselves, can affect immune antitumor properties and responses to immunotherapy. In this review, we will discuss the involvement of tryptophan, glutamine, and asparagine metabolism in the behavior of immune cells targeted by immunotherapy and summarize results of the most recent investigations on the impact of amino acid metabolites on immunotherapy."

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with MYC oncogene amplification remains a serious challenge in clinical practice. Recent advances in comprehensive treatment strategies, particularly the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy, offer new hope. To further improve efficacy while lowering radiation doses, nanopharmaceuticals based on high-Z elements have been extensively studied in radio-immunotherapy. In this work, a hafnium-based metal-organic framework (Hf-MOF), UiO-66-Hf(2OH)-CB-839/BSO@HA (UiO-66-Hf(2OH)-C/B@HA), was designed to codeliver telaglenastat (CB-839) and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), which synergistically inhibited glutamine metabolism and alleviated tumor hypoxia. Further modification with hyaluronic acid (HA) enhanced tumor targeting, ultimately strengthening the efficacy of radiotherapy in MYC-amplified HCC. Beyond increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, promoting DNA damage, and inducing tumor apoptosis, more importantly, UiO66-Hf(2OH)-C/B@HA triggered immunogenic cell death (ICD), driving the antitumor immune response. Combination with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) further enhanced the efficacy, accompanied by increased infiltration of T cells with high granzyme B expression (GZMB+ T cells) within the tumor microenvironment (TME). In the orthotopic HCC model, established with MYC-amplified tumor cells, intravenous administration of UiO66-Hf(2OH)-C/B@HA significantly potentiated the efficacy of radio-immunotherapy, resulting in superior tumor regression. In summary, our study provides insights into the design of Hf-MOF for radio-immunotherapy and proposes a promising therapeutic approach for MYC-amplified HCC.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CC) is a major global malignancy affecting women. However, the precise mechanisms underlying glutamine's role in CC remain inadequately understood. This study systematically assessed the survival outcomes, immune landscape, and drug sensitivity profiles with CC patients by analyzing genes associated with glutamine metabolism. METHODS: Transcriptomic data for the samples were sourced from the TCGA, GTEx, and GEO databases. Prognostic genes were identified through univariate, multivariate, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analyses. The predictive accuracy of the model was assessed through the analysis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. A comprehensive nomogram was developed and evaluated for accuracy using calibration and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) curves. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves were employed to estimate overall survival. The relationship between risk scores and immune infiltration was analyzed through Single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) and CIBERSORT. Functional enrichment analysis and the construction of miRNA and transcription factors networks were conducted to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of the signature genes. RESULTS: This investigation identified four signature genes associated with glutamine metabolism, UCP2, LEPR, TFRC, and RNaseH2A. We successfully developed a prognostic model with strong predictive performance. In the training set, the AUC values for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival were 0.702, 0.719, and 0.721, respectively. In the validation set, the AUC values for these time points were 0.715, 0.696, and 0.739, respectively. Patients categorized as low-risk had notably improved survival rates than those identified as high-risk (P < 0.05). Additionally, a nomogram that combines clinical data and risk scores offered improved clinical net benefits over a broad range of threshold probabilities. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these signature genes are strongly linked to the regulation of the cell cycle and intracellular oxygen levels. Furthermore, the gene signature displayed a significant negative correlation with the infiltration levels of most immune cell types. CONCLUSION: This novel signature demonstrates robust predictive capability for prognostic survival probabilities and immune infiltration in CC patients, providing a fresh perspective for advancing precision treatment strategies in CC."

Rats were administered sodium chloride, L-Gln, GS, or CXB via gavage for eight weeks starting from the fifth week after sham operation or Anterior Cruciate Ligament Transection (ACLT) + Medial Meniscectomy (MMx). Then the severity of knee OA in rats was evaluated by serological analysis, histological examination and imaging examination. In addition, patients with mild primary OA were administered L-Gln, GS, or CXB orally for 12 weeks in accordance with the randomization principle. The efficacy end points were the change from baseline to week 24 in the pain and physical function subscale scores of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA Index (WOMAC), and Lequesne score. Treatment with L-Gln alleviated the increased concentration of serum cartilage degradation markers caused by OA in rats. Histological tests showed improvement in knee joint cartilage destruction after treatment. Three-dimensional CT scans and reconstructions revealed a reduction in osteophyte formation and subchondral bone loss. L-glutamine performed as well as or better than glucosamine sulfate and celecoxib in all comparative measures among the three treatment groups. In clinical trials, the WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores, as well as the Lequesne score, decreased from baseline in all three patient groups during follow-up, with no significant differences observed between the groups. Our research indicates that L-Gln is comparable to GS and CXB in improving the pathological progression and clinical efficacy of OA, which makes it a promising drug for the treatment of osteoarthritis.",

      "abstract": "Glutamine plays a role in cell signaling that regulates gene expression and impacts tumorigenesis. However, it is still unclear how glutamine transduces signals in cells. Here, we show that glutamine binds to heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70) to stimulate the deubiquitinase otubain domain containing protein (OTUD4) independently of known glutamine metabolic or signaling pathways, resulting in lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) stabilization via the microautophagy-lysosome pathway, increased lactate production and decreased expression of interferon (IFN)-β and its targets, hallmarks of immunogenic cell death (ICD). In cancer cell lines and patient-derived organoids and xenografts, glutamine depletion or glutamine transport inhibition combined with ICD-inducing chemotherapeutic drugs synergistically activates IFN-β, promotes CD8+ T cell recruitment, and inhibits cancer cell growth via the OTUD4/LDHA axis. CD8 expression is negatively correlated with expression of the glutamine transporter alanine/serine/cysteine transporter 2 (ASCT2), OTUD4, and LDHA in cancer patients. Thus, we identify an intracellular glutamine signaling pathway, and targeting this pathway is a promising strategy for cancer treatment."

      "abstract": "Glutamine synthetase (GS), the only enzyme responsible for de novo glutamine synthesis, plays a significant role in cancer progression. As an example of the consequences of GS mutations, the R324C variant causes congenital glutamine deficiency, which results in brain abnormalities and neonatal death. However, the influence of GS-deficient mutations on cancer cells remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we investigated the effects of GS and GS-deficient mutations, including R324C and previously unreported K241R, which serve as models for GS inactivation. This study provided intriguing insights into the intricate relationship between GS mutations and cancer cell metabolism. Our findings strongly support recent studies that suggest GS deletion leads to the suppression of diverse signaling cascades associated with glutamine metabolism under glutamine-stripping conditions. The affected processes include DNA synthesis, the citric acid cycle, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification. This suppression originates from the inherent inability of cells to autonomously synthesize glutamine under glutamine-depleted conditions. As a key source of reduced nitrogen, glutamine is crucial for the formation of purine and pyrimidine bases, which are essential building blocks for DNA synthesis. Furthermore, the citric acid cycle is inhibited by the absence of negatively charged glutamate within the mitochondrial matrix, particularly when glutamine is scarce. This deficiency decreases the flux of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), a principal driver of the citric acid cycle. Intermediate metabolites of the citric acid cycle directly or indirectly contribute to the generation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, a core component of redox homeostasis. Using the GS_R324C and GS_K241R mutants, we conducted an integrative transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis. The GS mutants with reduced activity activated multiple amino acid biosynthesis pathways, including arginine-proline, glycine-serine-threonine, and alanine-aspartate-glutamate metabolism. This intriguing behavior led us to hypothesize that despite hindrance of the citric acid cycle, abundant intracellular glutamate is redirected through alternative processes, including transamination. Simultaneously, key metabolic enzymes in the amino acid synthesis pathways, such as glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1 (GOT1), glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 2 (GPT2), pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1), and phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1), exhibited increased mRNA levels. Additionally, GS deficiency appeared to upregulate the expression of glutamine transporters SLC38A2 and SLC1A5. Thus, restricting extracellular amino acids, such as glutamine, induces a stress response while promoting transcription or translation by a select group of genes, thereby facilitating cellular adaptation. However, similar to GS_WT, both GS_R324C and GS_K241R were modulated by glutamine treatment. Among GS-activity-dependent behaviors, the increased expression of numerous aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs), which are critical for aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, remains poorly understood. Most ARS-encoding genes are transcriptionally induced by activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), the expression of which increases under oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, hypoxia, and amino acid limitation. In GS-deficient cells, the increased expression of ATF4 was accompanied by pronounced stress caused by glutamine starvation. Thus, ARS upregulation may predominantly arise from increased ATF4 expression in GS-deficient cells. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis revealed the differential expression of specific genes, regardless of GS activity, suggesting that GS is involved in various processes other than glutamine synthesis, including angiogenesis. Although our omics study was limited to H1299 cells, in subsequent experiments, we validated our findings using additional cell lines, including Hepa1-6 and LN-229. To attain a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of the newly identified GS_K241R mutant, our investigation should be extended to various cell types and mouse models. In summary, we identified and investigated GS-deficient mutations in cancer cells and conducted an integrative transcriptomics-metabolomics analysis with comparisons to wild-type GS. This comprehensive approach provided crucial insights into the intricate pathways modulated by GS activity. Our findings advance the understanding of how GS functions in the context of reprogrammed cellular metabolism, particularly during glutamine deprivation. The altered metabolism triggered by elevated glutamate levels arising from GS mutations highlights the remarkable plasticity of cancer cell metabolism. Notably, considering the increasing research focus on GS as a potential therapeutic target in various cancer types, the findings of this study could provide innovative perspectives for drug development and the formulation of clinical treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Despite urea being the most widely used nitrogen fertilizer, many plants show reduced growth and protein content when urea is the nitrogen source. The underlying causes of nitrogen metabolism imbalance in urea supply remain unclear. In this study, we discovered that plastidic glutamine synthetase (GS2) can improve the physiological traits and protein production of duckweed cultivated with urea. By comparing the urea utilization processes between two duckweed strains, LpZH0104 and Lp9595, which exhibited marked differences under the same urea treatment, we found that GS2 significantly impacts nitrogen metabolism. Overexpressing the GS2 gene in an efficient genetic transformation system of duckweed enhanced nitrogen‑carbon metabolism, leading to a 10 % increase in biomass and a 24 % increase in protein content in the overexpression lines (OE lines). Protein productivity and PPPN (protein production per unit of applied fertilizer N) increased by 47 % and 32 %, respectively. Conversely, silencing the GS2 gene reduced these traits. Additionally, transforming GS2 gene into rice, tobacco, and Arabidopsis also enhanced their biomass and protein content under urea cultivation conditions. This study highlights GS2's role in enhancing nitrogen metabolism and physiological traits in plants cultivated with urea, offering valuable insights for improving biomass and protein production in crops using urea fertilizer."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glutamine (Gln) plays a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity of the rumen epithelial barrier in mammals. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Gln on histamine-induced barrier damage in yak rumen epithelial cells (YRECs). RESULTS: RT-qPCR analysis revealed a significant decrease in the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, JAM-A, Claudin-1, and Claudin-4) following 24-hour exposure to 20 µM histamine (HIS group) (P < 0.05). In the subsequent experiment, YRECs were first treated with 20 µM histamine for 24 h, followed by 8 mM glutamine for 12 h (HG group). Gln treatment reversed the histamine-induced downregulation of both mRNA and protein levels of tight junction proteins and restored the distribution of ZO-1 at the cell membrane. Transcriptome analysis revealed that co-regulated differentially expressed genes were primarily involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and apoptosis. These findings were further corroborated by RT-qPCR, Western blot, and flow cytometry analyses. To determine whether glutamine regulates cell barrier function through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, 20 µM Skatole, a p38 MAPK agonist, was introduced (SK group). The results showed a significant increase in the p-p38/p38 ratio and a marked decrease in the mRNA and protein expression of tight junction proteins in the SK group compared to the HG group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Glutamine mitigates histamine-induced barrier damage in YRECs through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and apoptosis regulation.",

The methodology entails crafting injectable gel scaffolds with short peptide molecules, incorporating the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 and copper peptide self-assembled particles (Cu-His NPs) renowned for their chemodynamic therapy (CDT) efficacy. By fine-tuning glutamic acid production via metabolic pathways, this system not only heightens the therapeutic prowess of copper peptide particles in CDT but also escalates intracellular oxidative stress.

      "abstract": "The constant replenishment of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, or anaplerosis, is crucial to ensure optimal TCA cycle activity in times of high biosynthetic demand. In inborn metabolic diseases, anaplerosis is often affected, leading to impaired TCA cycle flux and ATP production. In these cases, anaplerotic compounds can be a therapy option. Triheptanoin, a triglyceride containing three heptanoate chains, is thought to be anaplerotic through production of propionyl- and acetyl-CoA. However, the precise mechanism underlying its anaplerotic action remains poorly understood. In this study, we performed a comprehensive in vitro analysis of heptanoate metabolism and compared it to that of octanoate, an even-chain fatty acid which only provides acetyl-CoA. Using stable isotope tracing, we demonstrate that both heptanoate and octanoate contribute carbon to the TCA cycle in HEK293 T cells, confirming direct anaplerosis. Furthermore, by using labeled glucose and glutamine, we show that heptanoate and octanoate decrease the contribution of glucose-derived carbon and increase the influx of glutamine-derived carbon into the TCA cycle. Our findings also point towards a change in redox homeostasis, indicated by an increased NAD+/NADH ratio, accompanied by a decreased lactate/pyruvate ratio and increased de novo serine biosynthesis. Taken together, these results highlight the broad metabolic effects of heptanoate and octanoate supplementation, suggesting that therapeutic efficacy may strongly depend on specific disease pathophysiology. Furthermore, they underline the need for careful selection of fatty acid compound and concentration to optimize anaplerotic action.",

      "abstract": "Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a promising therapeutic modality known for its non-invasiveness, temporal-spatial controllability, and deeper tissue penetration. However, the SDT treatment efficacy is still hampered by the scarcity of ideal sonosensitizers and complex tumor microenvironment (TME). To address these challenges, a sono-metabolic nano-composite (TiO2-Au@DON) using the metabolic reprogramming prodrugs of 6-Diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON) grafted on TiO2-Au Janus nanoparticles (NPs) is fabricated. The coupling of TiO2 and gold in the TiO2-Au@DON effectively prevents the fast recombination of excited electrons and holes under ultrasound irradiation. The result is the generation of higher levels of both type I and II reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to pure TiO2, which helps overcome the limitations of SDT in the hypoxic TME. Furthermore, the TiO2-Au Janus NPs act as nano-carriers, delivering DON prodrugs to the tumor site. The released DON can disrupt nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) and tumor redox homeostasis by reprogramming the metabolic pathways while it intensifies the activities of immune cells. This metabolic disruption amplifies SDT-mediated oxidative stress, resulting in the increase of tumor sensitivity to ROS through TiO2-Au@DON-integrated synergistic effects of SDT and glutamine reprogramming strategies. This increased sensitivity ultimately induces robust immunogenic cell death (ICD), enhancing antitumor therapeutic efficacy and remodeling the tumor's immunosuppressive microenvironment.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: EGFR-targeting mAbs are essential for managing rat sarcoma virus wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), but their limited efficacy necessitates exploring immunologic and metabolic factors influencing response. This study evaluated glutamine metabolism targeting with EGFR inhibition to identify response biomarkers in patients with prior anti-EGFR treatment progression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a phase I/II trial in patients with KRAS wild-type mCRC, combining panitumumab (6 mg/kg) and CB-839 (600 mg/kg or 800 mg/kg), hypothesizing that the dual inhibition of glutamine metabolism and MAPK signaling would enhance outcomes. As study correlatives, we investigated the B-cell activation signature \"B-score\" and glutamine PET as potential treatment response biomarkers. RESULTS: The combination of panitumumab and CB-839 was tolerable with manageable side effects, including grade 4 hypomagnesemia in four patients, a known panitumumab-related event. Two patients achieved partial response, and five had stable disease, with a 41% disease control rate. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 1.84 and 8.87 months, respectively. A positive correlation between \"B-score\" and lesion size reduction suggested its association with clinical benefit (partial response and stable disease). Lower \"B-score\" correlated with greater tumor avidity for glutamine by PET, indicating B-cell activation sensitivity to glutamine depletion. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of CB-839 and panitumumab showed safety and promising preliminary responses, but the study closed early due to CB-839 development termination. The B-cell activation signature \"B-score\" emerged as a potential biomarker for EGFR and glutaminase inhibition in mCRC, warranting further studies. These findings suggest opportunities to improve immune response and therapies in glutaminolysis-dependent tumors.",

      "abstract": "Trametinib, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (MEK1/2), is used to treat BRAFV600E/K melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Mutant Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) promotes glutamine utilization, therefore, in the present study we investigated the anti-cancer effects of trametinib in combination with V-9302, a glutamine transporter inhibitor, in NSCLC with KRAS mutations. Trametinib in combination with V-9302 exhibited a potent synergistic antitumor effect, inducing cell cycle arrest and pyroptosis. Mechanistically, combination treatment triggered caspase-3 activation and gasdermin E (GSDME) cleavage, as well as elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and IL-1β levels. Meanwhile, combination treatment reduced cyclin D1 and p-Rb levels and increased p27 expression. Moreover, this combination increased forkhead box class O3a (FOXO3a) levels and decreased forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) expression by regulating the phosphorylation of ERK, Akt, AMPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Trametinib in combination with V-9302 increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and reduced glutathione (GSH) synthesis and ATP levels. Furthermore, V-9302 in combination with trametinib inhibited the trametinib-induced autophagy, thereby enhancing pyroptosis in cancer cells. In vivo, the co-administration of trametinib and V-9302 remarkably inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model compared to each drug alone. Taken together, the combination of trametinib and V-9302 resulted in increased pyroptosis and cell cycle arrest compared to each single agent through regulation of the FOXO3a/FOXM1 axis and autophagy and significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy in vivo. Our results suggest a potential new therapeutic strategy for KRAS-mutant NSCLC using trametinib in combination with glutamine restriction.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Our previous study found that astrocytes are involved in cumulative analgesia; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to further explore the potential role of astrocytes in the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on neuropathic pain by focusing on the glutamate-glutamine cycle. METHODS: 69 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into a normal control group, untreated chronic constriction injury (CCI) model group and EA-treated model (CCI + EA) group. EA was applied bilaterally at ST36 and GB34. Pain thresholds were assessed using behavioral tests and thermal stimuli. We examined the co-expression of glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) via immunofluorescence and measured the expression levels of GLAST, glutamate transporter (GLT)-1 and glutamine synthetase (GS) using Western blotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To validate the impact of GLAST/GLT-1 in the analgesic effect of EA, an additional 30 SD male rats were divided into groups receiving intrathecal saline, GLAST antagonist or GLT-1 antagonist alongside EA. RESULTS: Post-CCI, pain thresholds were decreased, GLAST expression was diminished, and spinal Glu levels were increased. EA treatment reversed these effects, improved pain thresholds and GLAST/GLT-1 expression in astrocytes, and reduced Glu levels. Antagonist administration negated the analgesic effects of EA. CONCLUSION: Repeated EA administration inhibited CCI-induced chronic neuropathic pain in rats, corresponding to a reversal of decreased expression of GLAST and GLT-1, which may have accelerated the clearance of Glu and thereby reduced its concentration. Regulation of the astroglial glutamate-glutamine cycle is a potential target of EA.",

      "abstract": "Glutamine metabolism is emerging as a target for improving immunotherapy efficacy. However, the outcomes remain inconclusive. Given that the tumor-intrinsic response to interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is a key determinant of immunotherapy efficacy, we investigated whether and how glutamine deprivation in cancer cells affects their response to IFN-γ. By using human lung cancer cell lines, patient-derived tumor explants, and a syngeneic mouse model of lung cancer, we demonstrated that glutamine deprivation reduced the IFN-γ-driven response in cancer cells by promoting autophagy-dependent IFN-γ receptor (IFNGR1) degradation and rendering tumors resistant to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy. Treatment with V9302, an inhibitor of the alanine-serine-cysteine transporter (ASCT2), enhanced the IFN-γ-driven response of cancer cells and increased the efficacy of PD-1 blockade therapy. Mechanistic analysis revealed that V9302 inhibited autophagy by impairing lysosomal activity independent of glutamine deprivation, likely because of its physiochemical properties, thereby preventing IFNGR1 degradation. Moreover, V9302 also increased Glut1 expression through the inhibition of lysosomal pathway-dependent degradation of Glut1 and consequently increased cancer cell glucose uptake, in turn retaining the levels of intracellular alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and ATP, which are involved in maintaining IFN-γ signal transduction in cancer cells. In support of these findings, targeting lysosomal activity with chloroquine (CQ) also increased IFNGR1 expression and the IFN-γ-driven response in cancer cells. The administration of CQ increased the sensitivity of ASCT2-deficient tumors to anti-PD-L1 therapy. Glutamine deprivation per se leads to resistance to immunotherapy, whereas V9302 treatment results in increased immunotherapy efficacy through impaired lysosomal activity, which is independent of glutamine deprivation.",

      "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansions in the huntingtin gene. HD-causative polyQ alleles lead to protein aggregation, which is a prerequisite for disease. Translation fidelity modifies protein aggregation, and several studies suggest that mutating one or two glutamine (Gln) residues in polyQ reduces aggregation. Thus, we hypothesized that missense suppression of Gln codons with other amino acids will reduce polyQ aggregate formation in cells. In neuroblastoma cells, we assessed tRNA variants that misread Gln codons with serine (tRNASer C/UUG) or alanine (tRNAAla C/UUG). The tRNAs with the CUG anticodon were more effective at suppressing the CAG repeats in polyQ, and serine and alanine mis-incorporation had differential impacts on polyQ. The expression of tRNASer CUG reduced polyQ protein production as well as both soluble and insoluble aggregate formation. In contrast, cells expressing tRNAAla CUG selectively decreased insoluble polyQ aggregate formation by 2-fold. Mass spectrometry confirmed Ala mis-incorporation at an average level of ∼20% per Gln codon. Cells expressing the missense suppressor tRNAs showed no cytotoxic effects and no defects in growth or global protein synthesis levels. Our findings demonstrate that tRNA-dependent missense suppression of Gln codons is well tolerated in mammalian cells and significantly reduces polyQ levels and aggregates that cause HD."

How epigenetic regulators contribute to the metabolic flexibility and PDAC's response and adaptation to Gln scarcity in the tumor milieu remains largely unknown. Here, we elucidate that prolonged Gln restriction or treatment with the Gln antagonist, 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), leads to growth inhibition and ferroptosis program activation in PDAC. A CRISPR-Cas9 screen identifies an epigenetic regulator, Paxip1, which promotes H3K4me3 upregulation and Hmox1 transcription upon DON treatment. Additionally, ferroptosis-related repressors (e.g., Slc7a11 and Gpx4) are increased as an adaptive response, thereby predisposing PDAC cells to ferroptosis upon Gln deprivation. Moreover, DON sensitizes PDAC cells to GPX4 inhibitor-induced ferroptosis, both in vitro and in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Taken together, our findings reveal that targeting Gln dependency confers susceptibility to GPX4-dependent ferroptosis via epigenetic remodeling and provides a combination strategy for PDAC therapy.",

Whether and how BET inhibition simultaneously induces metabolic remodeling in cancer cells remains unclear. Here we find that even transient BET inhibition by JQ-1 and other pan-BET inhibitors (pan-BETis) blunts liver cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. BET inhibition decreases glycolytic gene expression but enhances mitochondrial glucose and glutamine oxidative metabolism revealed by metabolomics and isotope labeling analysis. Specifically, BET inhibition downregulates miR-30a to upregulate glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH1) independent of MYC, which produces α-ketoglutarate for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Targeting GDH1 or OXPHOS is synthetic lethal to BET inhibition, and combined BET and OXPHOS inhibition therapeutically prevents liver tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Together, we uncover an important epigenetic-metabolic crosstalk whereby BET inhibition induces MYC-independent and GDH1-dependent glutamine metabolic remodeling that can be exploited for innovative combination therapy of liver cancer."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Targeting glutamine metabolism has emerged as a promising strategy in cancer therapy. However, several barriers, such as in vivo anti-tumor efficacy, drug toxicity, and safety, remain to be overcome to achieve clinical utility. Prior preclinical in vivo studies had generated encouraging data showing promises of cancer metabolism targeting drugs, although most were performed on immune-deficient murine models. It is being recognized that aside from tumor cells, normal cells such as immune cells in the tumor microenvironment may also utilize glutamine for maintaining physiological functions. To provide an in-depth view of glutamine antagonist (GLNi) treatment on the tumor immune microenvironment, the current study made several unique approaches. METHOD: First, to evaluate GLNi treatment modality that potentially involves immune cells, the study was performed on immunocompetent murine models of gynecological cancers. Second, to enhance safety and reduce potential off-target effects, we developed a GLNi prodrug, JHU083, which is bio-activated restrictively in cancer tissues. Third, to unbiasedly decode the response of single cells in the tumor microenvironment to GLNi treatment, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on cells prepared from tumors of the JHU083 or vehicle control-treated mice. RESULTS: In both immunocompetent murine tumor models, we observed a significant anti-tumor efficacy, resulting in reduced tumor burden and impeded tumor progression. Similarly, in both tumor models, scRNA-seq revealed significantly impeded immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages by JHU083, while the treatment spared pro-inflammatory M1-like tumor macrophages. In many tumor microenvironment (TME) cells, JHU083 downregulated genes regulated by Myc and hypoxia. M2 macrophages' greater sensitivity to glutamine antagonism when compared to M1 macrophages or monocytes was further validated on ex vivo cultures of bone marrow-derived macrophages. CONCLUSION: Our findings support a converged mechanism of glutamine metabolism antagonists. JHU083 exerted its anti-tumor efficacy through not only direct targeting of glutamine-addicted cancer cells but also by suppressing glutamine-dependent M2 macrophages, leading to a shift in the M1/M2 macrophage landscape in favor of an immune-stimulatory microenvironment."

AD involves complex pathologies, including amyloid plaque accumulation, synaptic dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. This study explores the therapeutic potential of N 5 -((perfluorophenyl)amino)glutamine (RA-PF), a derivative of γ-glutamyl-N'-(2-hydroxyphenyl)hydrazide (Ramalin), a compound with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Administration of RA-PF to 5xFAD mice decreases BACE1, reduces Aβ plaque deposition, inhibits microglial activation, restores synaptic transmission, and improves mitochondrial motility, leading to the recovery of cognitive function. Additionally, RA-PF treatment in 3xTg-AD mice alleviates anxiety-like behaviors, tau phosphorylation via inactivating GSK-3β, and BACE1 expression. Further transcriptomic analysis reveals RA-PF treatment in AD mice models recovers phagosome, inflammation, NOD-like receptor, presynaptic membrane, and postsynaptic membrane related signaling pathways. These findings suggest that RA-PF effectively targets multiple aspects of AD pathology, offering a novel multi-target approach for AD treatment.",

      "abstract": "Dry eye disease (DED) is a prevalent inflammatory condition significantly impacting quality of life, yet lacks effective pharmacological therapies. Herein, we proposed a novel approach to modulate the inflammation through metabolic remodeling, thus promoting dry eye recovery. Our study demonstrated that co-treatment with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and thymosin beta-4 (Tβ4) yielded the best therapeutic outcome against dry eye, surpassing monotherapy outcomes. In situ metabolomics through matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) revealed increased glutamine levels in cornea following MSC + Tβ4 combined therapy. Inhibition of glutamine reversed the anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and homeostasis-preserving effects observed with combined therapy, highlighting the critical role of glutamine in dry eye therapy. Clinical cases and rodent model showed elevated expression of glutaminase (GLS1), an upstream enzyme in glutamine metabolism, following dry eye injury. Mechanistic studies indicated that overexpression and inhibition of GLS1 counteracted and enhanced, respectively, the anti-inflammatory effects of combined therapy, underscoring GLS1's pivotal role in regulating glutamine metabolism. Furthermore, single-cell sequencing revealed a distinct subset of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic corneal epithelial cells in the dry eye model, while glutamine treatment downregulated those subclusters, thereby reducing their inflammatory cytokine secretion. In summary, glutamine effectively ameliorated inflammation and the occurrence of apoptosis by downregulating the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic corneal epithelial cells subclusters and the related IκBα/NF-κB signaling. The present study suggests that glutamine metabolism plays a critical, previously unrecognized role in DED and proposes an attractive strategy to enhance glutamine metabolism by inhibiting the enzyme GLS1 and thus alleviating inflammation-driven DED progression.",

      "abstract": "Gastric cancer is a common digestive system tumor with a high resistance rate that reduces the sensitivity to chemotherapy. Nutrition therapy is an important adjuvant approach to favor the prognosis of gastric cancer. Dietary amino acids contribute greatly to gastric cancer progression by mediating tumor gene expressions, epigenetics, signal transduction, and metabolic remodeling. In the present study, 20 types of amino acids were screened and glutamine, glycine and serine were identified as the critical regulators of cisplatin (DDP) sensitivity in gastric cancer cells. Moreover, KDM4A acetylation drove the reduced chemotherapy sensitivity in gastric cancer cells by maintaining protein stability and activating DNA repair ability when the concentrations of glutamine (Gln), serine (Ser), and glycine (Gly) decreased. Conversely, Gln/Ser/Gly at increasing concentrations stimulated ubiquitination degradation of KDM4A, which in turn elevated the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to chemotherapy. Our findings unveiled the role of amino acid nutrition in regulating chemotherapy sensitivity of gastric cancer and the underlying mechanism, thus providing a scientific basis for expanding the clinical significance of nutrition therapy for gastric cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "Tumour cell immune infiltration is linked to spindle pole component 25 (SPC25). The purpose of this work was to examine the function and molecular mechanism of SPC25 in immune escape in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). SPC25 expression in LUAD was examined using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and RT-qPCR was used to confirm the results. The study involved the use of CD8+ T lymphocytes for immunoinfiltration analysis of SPC25, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis of signalling pathways enriched by SPC25, identification of putative regulatory molecules of SPC25, and confirmation through the use of dual-luciferase and ChIP tests. To evaluate LUAD cell capacity for immune escape, a co-culture technique was employed. Measurements of glutamine uptake, glutamate and α-ketoglutarate levels, NADPH/NADP and GSH/GSSG ratios, and SLC1A5 expression were used to assess the levels of glutamine metabolism. LUAD had increased SPC25 expression. In LUAD cells, immune escape was facilitated by SPC25 knockdown, whereas overexpression had the reverse effect. SPC25 enrichment in the glutamine metabolism pathway was shown by GSEA analysis. Through increased glutamine metabolism brought on by SPC25 overexpression, immune escape was improved in LUAD and could be mitigated by GPNA therapy. E2F8 was also shown to be the transcription factor associated with SPC25, and they showed a binding interaction. By inhibiting glutamine metabolism through SPC25, knocking down E2F8 prevented immune escape in LUAD cells. On the other hand, the suppression of immune escape in LUAD cells caused by E2F8 knockdown was overcome by overexpression of SPC25. In LUAD, E2F8 stimulates SPC25 expression to facilitate glutamine metabolism and encourage immune escape. Our research validates a novel immune escape pathway driven by SPC25 in LUAD cells, providing LUAD patients with potentially effective immunotherapeutic approaches.",

      "abstract": "Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab), a nontuberculous mycobacterium, is increasing in prevalence worldwide and causes treatment-refractory pulmonary diseases. However, how Mab rewires macrophage energy metabolism to facilitate its survival is poorly understood. We compared the metabolic profiles of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) infected with smooth (S)- and rough (R)-type Mab using extracellular flux technology. Mab infection shifted BMDMs towards a more energetic phenotype, marked by increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis, with a significantly greater enhancement in OXPHOS. This metabolic adaptation was characterized by enhanced ATP production rates, particularly in cells infected with S-type Mab, highlighting OXPHOS as a key energy source. Notably, Mab infection also modulated mitochondrial substrate preferences, increasing fatty acid oxidation capabilities while revealing significant changes in glutamine dependency and flexibility. R-type Mab infections exhibited a marked decrease in glutamine reliance but enhanced metabolic flexibility and capacity. Furthermore, targeting metabolic pathways related to glutamine and fatty acid oxidation exacerbated Mab growth within macrophages, suggesting these pathways play a protective role against infection. These insights advance our understanding of Mab's impact on host cell metabolism and propose a novel avenue for therapeutic intervention. By manipulating host mitochondrial metabolism, we identify a potential host-directed therapeutic strategy against Mab, offering a promising alternative to conventional treatments beleaguered by drug resistance. This study underscores the importance of exploring metabolic interventions to combat Mab infection, paving the way for innovative approaches in the fight against this formidable pathogen.",

      "abstract": "Cancer cells undergo metabolic rewiring to support rapid proliferation and survival in challenging environments. Glutamine is a preferred resource for cancer metabolism, as it provides both carbon and nitrogen for cellular biogenesis. Recent studies suggest the potential anticancer activity of amino acid analogs. Some of these analogs disrupt cellular nucleotide synthesis, thereby inhibiting the formation of DNA and RNA in cancer cells. In the present study, we investigated the anticancer properties of Acivicin and Azaserine in the breast cancer MCF-7 cell line, comparing their effects to those on the non-tumorigenic MCF-10 epithelial cell line in vitro. Interestingly, at lower concentrations, both Acivicin and Azaserine showed potent inhibition of MCF-7 cell proliferation, as assessed by the MTT assay, without detectable toxicity to normal cells. In contrast, Sorafenib (Nexavar), a commonly used drug for solid tumors, showed harmful effects on normal cells, as indicated by increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) production in treated cells. Furthermore, unlike Sorafenib, treatment with Acivicin and Azaserine significantly affected apoptotic signaling in treated cells, indicating the role of both amino acid analogs in activating programmed cell death (PCD), as assessed by the Annexin-V assay, DAPI staining, and the relative expression of tumor suppressor genes PTEN and P53. ELISA analysis of MCF-7 cells revealed that both Acivicin and Azaserine treatments promoted the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-10, while significantly reducing the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Mechanistically, both Acivicin and Azaserine treatment led to a significant reduction in the expression of glutamine synthetase (GS) at both the RNA and protein levels, resulting in a decrease in intracellular glutamine concentrations over time. Additionally, both treatments showed comparable effects on Raf-1 gene expression and protein phosphorylation when compared with Sorafenib, a Raf-1 inhibitor. Moreover, docking studies confirmed the strong binding affinity between Acivicin, Azaserine, and glutamine synthetase, as evidenced by their docking scores and binding interactions with the enzyme crystal. Collectively, these findings provide evidence for the anticancer activity of the two amino acid analogs Acivicin and Azaserine as antagonists of glutamine synthetase, offering novel insights into potential therapeutic strategies for breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "Glutamine synthetase (GS) plays a crucial role in the homeostasis of the glutamate-glutamine cycle in the brain. Hypoactive GS causes depressive behaviors. Under chronic stress, GS has no change in expression, but its activity is decreased due to nitration of tyrosine (Tyr). Thus, we speculate that agents that prevent nitration or facilitate denitration of GS would be candidates for new antidepressants. Using human recombinant GS and mouse lysate from the medial prefrontal cortex, we demonstrated that Tyr (0.0313-0.5 µM) dose-dependently protected GS activity against peroxynitrite-induced Tyr-nitration of GS. Diet supplementation with Tyr exerted significant antidepressant effects in a chronic immobilization stress depression mouse model. We further found that dipeptides, such as tyrosyl-glutamine (YQ), that had appropriate chemical properties for medication also increased GS activity both in vitro and in vivo and exerted antidepressant effects. Because reduced GS activity also occurs in epilepsy and hyperammonemia, we evaluated whether Tyr and YQ had therapeutic effects. Interestingly, Tyr or YQ administration significantly attenuated kainic acid-induced seizures in mice and reduced blood ammonia levels in azoxymethane- or bile duct ligation-induced hyperammonemia mouse models, which was accompanied by an increment in GS activity. The activation of GS was accomplished by a decrement in Tyr-nitration, so-called Tyr-denitration. Therefore, this study demonstrates that the activation of GS could be a new strategy to treat depression and other GS-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: In older patients undergoing cardiac surgery, physical function is a critical determinant of postoperative outcomes. Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation has been shown to promote muscle protein anabolism and inhibit catabolism, thereby preventing muscle weakness. However, its efficacy in older patients undergoing cardiac surgery remains unknown. This study aimed to examine the effects of preoperative HMB supplementation on postoperative physical function and complications in this population. METHODS: In this single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial, patients aged ≥65 years scheduled for cardiac surgery were randomized to receive HMB supplementation or no nutritional intervention. The HMB group received HMB 1200 mg, l-glutamine 7000 mg, and l-arginine 7000 mg, once or twice daily, for at least 2 weeks before surgery. Evaluations were performed at baseline and before and after surgery. The primary outcome was the 6-min walking distance (6MWD) before and after surgery. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of complications, muscle mass and strength, physical performance, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Forty-four patients with a mean age of 72.5 years (women, 38 %) were randomized to the HMB (n = 22) or control (n = 22) group. Compared with the control group, the HMB group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the 6MWD both at the pre-surgery (448.0 ± 73.5 m vs. 375.5 ± 58.8 m; P = 0.01) and post-surgery time points (428.9 ± 76.4 m vs. 304.5 ± 52.3 m; P = 0.001). Muscle strength and physical performance also showed significant improvements in the HMB group. However, no significant difference in muscle mass was observed between the groups at any time point. The HMB group had a shorter hospital length of stay compared with that of the control group (16.1 ± 3.8 days vs. 20.4 ± 7.6 days, P = 0.03), and no adverse events were observed with the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative HMB supplementation in older adults undergoing cardiac surgery resulted in significant improvements in postoperative exercise capacity and physical function, along with a reduction in the length of hospital stay, without affecting muscle mass.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of nutritional supplementation with a glutamine-enriched peptide diet (PD) compared to exclusive dietary advice (DA) on gastrointestinal toxicity, interruption of oncologic treatment, and nutritional evolution in patients with rectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant treatment. METHODS: Prospective cohort study with two groups. Patients with rectal cancer in treatment with neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy were recruited. One group of patients received nutritional supplementation with PD, and another group received DA exclusively, from the beginning of radiotherapy until the time of surgery. Intestinal toxicity was evaluated with the CTCAE 5.0 scale, functionality with the ECOG scale and nutritional status with GLIM criteria. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were initially selected, although 51 were finally enrolled: 25 in the PD group and 26 in the DA group. There was a reduction in the risk of diarrhea in the PD group midway through radiotherapy treatment [RR of 0.218 (95% CI = 0.052-0.923)] and at the end of treatment [RR of 0.103 (95% CI = 0.020-0.537)], as well as a reduction in the risk of developing mucositis at the end of treatment [RR of 0.405 (95% CI = 0.280-0.584)]. The use of a PD also decreased treatment interruptions with radiotherapy in stage III patients (0 vs. 15.8%, p = 0.049) and in malnourished patients (0 vs. 18.2%, p = 0.040). CONCLUSION: The glutamine-enriched peptide diet had a protective effect on the development of diarrhea and mucositis associated with chemo-radiotherapeutic treatment in patients with colorectal cancer under neoadjuvant treatment, as well as the interruption of radiotherapeutic treatment."

      "abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) is a highly malignant gynecological tumor, and its effective treatment is frequently impeded by drug resistance and recurrent tumor growth. The reprogramming of glutamine metabolism in ovarian cancer is closely associated with tumor progression and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Recently, targeting metabolic reprogramming has emerged as a promising approach for cancer therapy. However, the application of such therapies is often constrained by their significant toxicity to normal tissues. In this study, we fabricated folate-targeted nanoparticles (FA-DCNPs) that co-encapsulate the glutamine metabolism inhibitor 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3). These nanoparticles alleviate damage to normal tissues by specifically targeting tumor cells via folate receptors (FOLR) mediation. Under acidic conditions, the FA-DCNPs release DON and Ca2+, generating a synergistic anti-tumor effect by impeding glutamine metabolism and inducing calcium overload. Additionally, FA-DCNPs target M2 phenotype tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) via FOLR2, attenuating M2-TAMs activity. When partially phagocytosed by M0-TAMs, the nanoparticles restrict glutamate production, inhibiting polarization towards the M2 phenotype. This resulted in an increased proportion of M1-TAMs, thereby improving the tumor immune microenvironment. Our study explores a nanotherapeutic strategy that enhances the biosafety of anti-glutamine metabolism therapy through folate targeting, effectively suppresses tumor cell proliferation, and enhances the anti-tumor immune response.",

      "abstract": "Glutamine metabolism is pivotal in cancer biology, profoundly influencing tumor growth, proliferation, and resistance to therapies. Cancer cells often exhibit an elevated dependence on glutamine for essential functions such as energy production, biosynthesis of macromolecules, and maintenance of redox balance. Moreover, altered glutamine metabolism can contribute to the formation of an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment characterized by reduced immune cell infiltration and activity. In this study on lung adenocarcinoma, we employed consensus clustering and applied 101 types of machine learning methods to systematically identify key genes associated with glutamine metabolism and develop a risk model. This comprehensive approach provided a clearer understanding of how glutamine metabolism associates with cancer progression and patient outcomes. Notably, we constructed a robust nomogram based on clinical information and patient risk scores, which achieved a stable area under the curve (AUC) greater than 0.8 for predicting patient survival across four datasets, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This nomogram not only enhances our ability to stratify patient risk but also offers potential targets for therapeutic intervention aimed at disrupting glutamine metabolism and sensitizing tumors to existing treatments. Moreover, we identified ALDH18A1 as a prognostic hub gene of glutamine metabolism, characterized by high expression levels in glutamine cluster 3, which is associated with poor clinical outcomes and worse survival, and is included in the risk model. Such insights underscore the critical role of glutamine metabolism in cancer and highlight avenues for personalized medicine in oncology research."

      "abstract": "Glutamine, akin to glucose, is a fundamental nutrient for human physiology. Tumor progression is often accompanied by elevated glutamine consumption, resulting in a disrupted nutritional balance and metabolic reprogramming within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, immune cells, which depend on glutamine for metabolic support, may experience functional impairments and dysregulation. Although the role of glutamine in tumors has been extensively studied, the specific impact of glutamine competition on immune responses, as well as the precise cellular alterations within immune cells, remains incompletely understood. In this review, we summarize the consequences of glutamine deprivation induced by tumor-driven glutamine uptake on immune cells, assessing the underlying mechanisms from the perspective of various components of the immune microenvironment. Additionally, we discuss the potential synergistic effects of glutamine supplementation and immunotherapy, offering insights into future research directions. This review provides compelling evidence for the integration of glutamine metabolism and immunotherapy as a promising strategy in cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have markedly improved the overall survival rate of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), enabling them to achieve a normal life expectancy. However, toxicity, relapse, and drug resistance continue to pose major challenges in the clinical treatment of CML. The progression of leukemia is directly connected to higher expression levels and enzymatic actions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). It is also associated with increased expression and enzymatic actions of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). From this perspective, MMP-2 and MMP-9 offers a promising strategy for developing novel therapeutic molecules that could be effective in treating CML. This study is the Part-III of D(-)-glutamine-based MMP-2 inhibitors series for the management of chronic myeloid leukemia. Fourteen newly synthesized p-tosyl-D(-)-glutamine derivatives were examined in cell culture-based antileukemic assays and also evaluated for their ability to inhibit MMPs. The lead compounds 5g and 5j demonstrated the most promising antileukemic potential. Compounds 5g and 5j are safe for normal cells and effectively block gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9). The best active molecule 5g induced significant apoptosis. Compound 5g reduced MMP-2 levels in the K562 cell line. It also had strong antiangiogenic effects in the ACHN cell line. The strongest MMP-2 inhibitor, 5g, had stable binding at the MMP-2 active site, which is linked to its effective inhibition of MMP-2. In conclusion, these p-tosyl-D(-)-glutamine derivatives are promising MMP-2 inhibitors. They have strong anti-CML effects and should be studied more for future CML treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Liver metastasis from colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major clinical challenge that severely affects patient survival. myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts (myCAFs) are a major component of the CRC tumor microenvironment, where they contribute to tumor progression and metastasis through exosomes. METHODS: Single-cell analysis highlighted a notable increase in myCAFs in colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM). Exosomal sequencing identified PWAR6 as the most significantly elevated lncRNA in these metastatic tissues. In vivo and in vitro assays confirmed PWAR6's roles in CRC cell stemness, migration, and glutamine uptake. RNA pulldown, RIP, and Co-IP assays investigated the molecular mechanisms of the PWAR6/NRF2/SLC38A2 signaling axis in CRC progression, flow cytometry was used to assess NK cell activity and cytotoxicity. RESULTS: Clinically, higher PWAR6 expression levels are strongly associated with increased 68Ga FAPI-PET/CT SUVmax values, particularly in CRLM patients, where expression significantly exceeds that of non-LM cases and normal colon tissues. Regression analysis and survival data further support PWAR6 as a negative prognostic marker, with elevated levels correlating with worse patient outcomes. Mechanistically, PWAR6 promotes immune evasion by inhibiting NRF2 degradation through competitive binding with Keap1, thereby upregulating SLC38A2 expression, which enhances glutamine uptake in CRC cells and depletes glutamine availability for NK cells. CONCLUSION: myCAFs derived exosomes PWAR6 represents a pivotal marker for CRC liver metastasis, and its targeted inhibition with ASO-PWAR6, in combination with FAPI treatment, effectively curtails metastasis in preclinical models, offering promising therapeutic potential for clinical management.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multi-lineage differentiation of mesenchymal adult stem cells (m-ASCs) is crucial for tissue regeneration and accompanied with metabolism reprogramming, among which dental-pulp-derived m-ASCs has obvious advantage of easy accessibility. Stem cell fate determination and differentiation are closely related to metabolism status in cell microenvironment, which could actively interact with epigenetic modification. In recent years, glutamine-α-ketoglutarate (αKG) axis was proved to be related to aging, tumorigenesis, osteogenesis etc., while its role in m-ASCs still lack adequate research evidence. METHODS: We employed metabolomic analysis to explore the change pattern of metabolites during dental-pulp-derived m-ASCs differentiation. A murine incisor clipping model was established to investigate the influence of αKG on dental tissue repairment. shRNA technique was used to knockdown the expression of related key enzyme-dehydrogenase 1(GLUD1). RNA-seq, m6A evaluation and MeRIP-qPCR were used to dig into the underlying epigenetic mechanism. RESULTS: Here we found that the glutamine-αKG axis displayed an increased tendency along with the osteo/odontogenic differentiation of dental-pulp-derived m-ASCs, same as expression pattern of GLUD1. Further, the key metabolite αKG was found able to accelerate the repairment of clipped mice incisor and promote dentin formation. Exogenous DM-αKG was proved able to promote osteo/odontogenic differentiation of dental-pulp-derived m-ASCs, while the inhibition of glutamine-derived αKG level via GLUD1 knockdown had the opposite effect. Under the circumstance of GLUD1 knockdown, extracellular matrix (ECM) function and PI3k-Akt signaling pathway was screened out to be widely involved in the process with insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) participation via RNA-seq. Inhibition of glutamine-αKG axis may affect IGF2 translation efficiency via m6A methylation and can be significantly rescued by αKG supplementation. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that glutamine-αKG axis may epigenetically promote osteo/odontogenic differentiation of dental-pulp-derived m-ASCs and dentin regeneration, which provide a new research vision of potential dental tissue repairment therapy method or metabolite-based drug research.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a particularly aggressive type of breast cancer, known for its lack of effective treatments and unfavorable prognosis. The G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), a novel estrogen receptor, is linked to increased malignancy in various cancers. However, its involvement in the metabolic regulation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a key component in the tumour microenvironment, remains largely unexplored. This study investigates how GPER influences the metabolic interaction between CAFs and TNBC cells, aiming to identify potential therapeutic targets. METHODS: The co-culture system is performed to examine the interaction between CAFs and TNBC cells, with a focus on GPER-mediated glutamine production and release by CAFs and its subsequent uptake and utilization by TNBC cells. The definite roles of microenvironmental GPER/cAMP/PKA/CREB signalling in regulating the expression of glutamine synthetase (GLUL) and lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) are further investigated. RESULTS: Our findings reveal that estrogen-activated GPER in CAFs significantly upregulates the expression of GLUL and LDHB, leading to increased glutamine production. This glutamine is then secreted into the extracellular matrix and absorbed by TNBC cells, enhancing their viability, motility, and chemoresistance both in vitro and in vivo. TNBC cells further metabolize the glutamine through the glutamine transporter (ASCT2) and glutaminase (GLS1) axes, which, in turn, promote mitochondrial activity and tumour progression. CONCLUSIONS: The study identifies GPER as a critical mediator of metabolic coupling between CAFs and TNBC cells, primarily through glutamine metabolism. Targeting the estrogen/GPER/glutamine signalling axis in CAFs offers a promising therapeutic strategy to inhibit TNBC progression and improve patient outcomes. This novel insight into the tumour microenvironment highlights the potential of metabolic interventions in treating TNBC. KEY POINTS: Estrogen-activated GPER in CAFs enhances GLUL and LDHB expression via the cAMP/PKA/CREB signalling, facilitating glutamine production and utilization. Microenvironmental GPER-induced glutamine serves as a crucial mediator of metabolic coupling between CAFs and TNBC cells, boosting tumour progression by enhancing mitochondrial function. Targeting the glutamine metabolic coupling triggered by estrogen/GPER/GLUL signalling in CAFs is a promising therapeutic strategy for TNBC treatment.",

Ninety-six 24-day-old weaning piglets (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire, weaned at 21 ± 1 d and fed the basal diet for a 3 d adaptation period) with initial body weight of 7.24 ± 0.09 kg were randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments with six replicates per treatment and four pigs per replicate in a 2 × 2 factorial treatment arrangements: (1) CON (a 2-period basal diet; control), (2) LS (supplemented with 2% lactic acid), (3) GS (supplemented with 1% glutamine), and (4) LGS (supplemented with 2% lactic acid and 1% glutamine). The study lasted for 28 d. On days 25-28, fresh fecal samples were collected to evaluate apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients. After 28 d, one weaning pig per pen was euthanized, and physiological samples obtained. Results showed that the supplementation of lactic acid improved the ADFI of the pigs (p < 0.05), while the pigs fed the glutamine diet had a greater ADFI and higher G/F (p < 0.05), and there were significant interactive effects between lactic acid and glutamine on the ADFI and G/F of the pigs (p < 0.05). The ATTD of CP and ash for pigs fed with lactic acid was significantly enhanced, and pigs fed the glutamine diet had greater ATTD of CP and ash (p < 0.05), while there were significant interactive effects between lactic acid and glutamine on the ATTD of CP and ash of the pigs (p < 0.05). Pigs fed with lactic acid exhibited greater activity of α-amylase and lipase (p < 0.05); moreover, the activity of lipase in the pigs showed a significant interactive effect between lactic acid and glutamine (p < 0.05). There was a greater villus height and villus height to crypt depth ratio in pigs fed with lactic acid (p < 0.05), and the villus height to crypt depth ratio of pigs fed with glutamine was greater (p < 0.05). There were greater GLUT2, IGF-1, TGF-β2, OCLN, and ZO-1 mRNA levels in pigs fed with lactic acid (p < 0.05), and the supplementation of glutamine increased SGLT1, GLUT2, PepT1, IGF-1, IGF-1R, TGFβ-2, GLP-2, and OCLN mRNA levels (p < 0.05), Additionally, expressions of SGLT1, GLUT2, PepT1, IGF-1, IGF-1R, TGFβ-2, GLP-2, CLDN-2, OCLN, and ZO-1 mRNA levels of pigs showed a positive interactive effect between lactic acid and glutamine (p < 0.05). Supplementation of lactic acid significantly increased the populations of Bifidobacterium in cecal digesta, Lactobacillus in colonic digesta, and the content of butyric acid in colonic digesta (p < 0.05). In addition, there were significant interactive effects between lactic acid and glutamine on populations of Bifidobacterium in cecal digesta, Lactobacillus in colonic digesta, and the content of acetic acid, butyric acid, and total VFAs in cecal digesta of the pigs (p < 0.05). Collectively, the current results indicate that dietary supplementation with lactic acid and glutamine had a positive synergistic effect on weaning pigs, which could improve growth performance through promoting the development of the small intestine, increasing digestive and barrier function, and regulating the balance of microflora in pigs, and which might be a potential feeding additive ensemble to enhance the health and growth of weaning piglets in the post-antibiotic era."

Sarcopenia has been reported to be a poor prognostic factor for HCC. Here, we performed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the efficacy of a β-hydroxy-β-methyl butyrate/l-arginine/l-glutamine (HMB/Arg/Gln) beverage and locomotion training as supportive care in the treatment of uHCC with lenvatinib. METHODS: A total of 20 patients were enrolled from the jRCTs031190252 trial in this pilot study. HFSR was the primary endpoint, and other adverse events and skeletal muscle index at the third lumbar level (L3-SMI) were secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Twelve patients had albumin-bilirubin grade 1, and eight had grade 2. No difference in HFSR was observed. Although interesting differences were observed in the secondary endpoints, a slight retention of L3-SMI values in the intervention group compared with that in the control group was observed (96.5 % vs. 89.9 %, p = 0.407). CONCLUSION: Although the HMB/Arg/Gln beverage and locomotion training did not reduce adverse events caused by lenvatinib, they might be useful in maintaining skeletal muscle mass. Further validation studies with a larger number of patients are warranted.",

      "abstract": "The persistent airway inflammation is the main characteristic of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), typically caused by an indoor environment pollution cigarette smoke (CS). METTL16 is an m6A methyltransferase that has been proven to be closely associated with the occurrence of various diseases. However, its exact role in smoking-induced COPD remains to be investigated. In this study, we found that the level of METTL16 was aberrantly decreased in lung tissues of COPD smokers. Similarly, murine model induced by CS and lung epithelial cell model induced by cigarette smoke extract (CSE) also confirmed this discovery. Moreover, in the Mettl16-deficient (Mettl16+/-) mice challenged with CS, airway inflammation was aggravated. To identify the potential target genes and regulatory pathways through METTL16, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (meRIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and metabolomic profiling were used. Knockdown of METTL16 significantly reduced the stability of glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2 (GOT2) and downregulated its expression through m6A modification, while reprogramed glutamine metabolism in lung epithelial cells. Significant reduction in inflammation levels was observed in the 3-month COPD murine model fed a glutamine-supplemented diet. Mechanistically, METTL16 could regulate lung epithelial mitochondrial function by participating in the reprogramming of glutamine metabolism. Our study characterized the role of the METTL16/GOT2/glutamine axis in the occurrence and development of COPD, and emphasized the potential value of METTL16 and glutamine in the therapy of chronic airway inflammation in smoking-induced COPD.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent form of cancer among women and is a major contributor to cancer-related fatalities. Nanotechnology has provided novel approaches to drug delivery to cancer cells. In this work, we synthesized platinum (Pt) nanoparticles, functionalized them with glutamine, conjugated them with thiosemicarbazone (TSC), and characterized their anticancer effects on the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. Characteristics of the nanoparticles were assessed by FT-IR, XRD, EDS mapping, SEM, TEM, DLS, and zeta potential measurement. Cell viability was characterized by MTT assay, and cell necrosis/apoptosis levels were determined by flow cytometry. The expression level of the CASP-8 gene was investigated by real-time PCR. Pt@Gln-TSC nanoparticles are spherical, 20-70 nm in diameter in dry form, 662 nm after hydration, and their zeta potential was - 6.6 mV. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer) and HDF (normal) cell lines was 170 and 348µg/ml, respectively. Also, the IC50 of oxaliplatin drug and TSC on MDA-MB-231 cells was 184 µg/ml and 307 µg/ml, respectively. Treatment with Pt@Gln-TSC nanoparticles caused an increase in cell necrosis and primary apoptosis and elevated the expression of the CASP-8 gene by 2.54 folds. This study shows that Pt@Gln-TSC nanoparticles are significantly more toxic to breast cancer cells than to normal cells and can inhibit MDA-MB-231 cells by activating extrinsic apoptosis."

      "abstract": "Understanding the fundamental biochemical and metabolic requirements for the replication of coronaviruses within infected cells is of notable interest for the development of broad-based therapeutic strategies, given the likelihood of the emergence of new pandemic-potential virus species, as well as future variants of SARS-CoV-2. Here we demonstrate members of the glutaminase family of enzymes (GLS and GLS2), which catalyze the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate (i.e., the first step in glutamine metabolism), play key roles in coronavirus replication in host cells. Using a range of human seasonal and zoonotic coronaviruses, we show three examples where GLS expression increases during coronavirus infection of host cells, and another where GLS2 is upregulated. The viruses hijack the metabolic machinery responsible for glutamine metabolism to generate the building blocks for biosynthetic processes and satisfy the bioenergetic requirements demanded by the \"glutamine addiction\" of virus-infected cells. We demonstrate that genetic silencing of glutaminase enzymes reduces coronavirus infection and that newer members of two classes of allosteric inhibitors targeting these enzymes, designated as SU1, a pan-GLS/GLS2 inhibitor, and UP4, a specific GLS inhibitor, block viral replication in epithelial cells. Moreover, treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-human ACE2 transgenic mice with SU1 resulted in their complete survival compared to untreated control animals, which succumbed within 10 days post-infection. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of glutamine metabolism for coronavirus replication in human cells and mice and show that glutaminase inhibitors can block coronavirus infection and thereby may represent a novel class of broad-based anti-viral drug candidates.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes. Retinal neuronal degeneration is an early event in DR, indicated by the declined electroretinogram (ERG). Dipeptide alanine-glutamine (Ala-Gln) is widely used as a nutritional supplement in the clinic and has anti-inflammatory effects on the gastrointestinal system. Studies also reported that glutamine has beneficial effects on diabetes. This study aimed to investigate the possible therapeutic effects of Ala-Gln in diabetic retinal neurodegeneration and to delineate its mechanism of action. METHODS: The Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rat model was used as a DR model. ERG was used to measure the neuronal function of the retina. Western blot analysis was performed to test the expression of proteins. Immunofluorescence staining was used for the detection and localization of proteins. RESULTS: In diabetic rats, the amplitudes of ERG were declined, while Ala-Gln restored the declined ERG. Retinal levels of inflammatory factors were significantly decreased in Ala-Gln-treated diabetic rats. Ala-Gln mitigated the declined levels of glutamine synthetase and ameliorated the upregulated levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in diabetic retinas. Moreover, Ala-Gln upregulated the glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase isozymes 2 (PKM2), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and LDHB and stimulated the mTOR signaling pathway in diabetic retinas. The mitochondrial function was improved after the treatment of Ala-Gln in diabetic retinas. DISCUSSION: Ala-Gln ameliorates retinal neurodegeneration by reducing inflammation and enhancing glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function in DR. Therefore, manipulation of metabolism by Ala-Gln may be a novel therapeutic avenue for retinal neurodegeneration in DR."

      "abstract": "Rotavirus (RV) accounts for 19.11% of global diarrheal deaths. Though GAVI assisted vaccine introduction has curtailed RV induced mortality, factors like RV strain diversity, differential infantile gut microbiome, malnutrition, interference from maternal antibodies and other administered vaccines, etc. often compromise vaccine efficacy. Herein emerges the need of antivirals which can be administered adjunct to vaccination to curb the socio-economic burden stemming from frequent RV infection. Cognisance of pathogen-perturbed host cellular physiology has revolutionized translational research and aided precision-based therapy, particularly for viruses, with no metabolic machinery of their own. To date there has been limited exploration of the host cellular metabolome in context of RV infection. In this study, we explored the endometabolomic landscape of human intestinal epithelial cells (HT-29) on RV-SA11 infection. Significant alteration of host cellular metabolic pathways like the nucleotide biosynthesis pathway, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism pathway, the host citric acid cycle was observed in RV-SA11 infection scenario. Detailed study further revealed that RV replication is exclusively dependent on glutamine metabolism for their propagation in host cells. Glutamine metabolism generates glutamate, aspartate, and asparagine which facilitates virus infection. Abrogation of aspartate biogenesis from glutamine by use of Aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), significantly curbed RV-SA11 infection in-vitro and in-vivo. Overall, the study improves our understanding of host-rotavirus interactome and recognizes host glutamine metabolism pathway as a suitable target for effective therapeutic intervention against RV infection.",

Recent investigations have validated the potential of reducing glutamine synthetase (GS) to inhibit neovascularization formation, offering prospects for treating various neovascularization-related diseases. In this study, we devised a CRISPR/Cas9 delivery system employing the nucleic acid aptamer AS1411 as a targeting moiety and exosome-liposome hybrid nanoparticles as carriers (CAELN). Exploiting the binding affinity between AS1411 and nucleolin on endothelial cell surfaces, the delivery system was engineered to specifically target the glutamine synthetase gene (GLUL), thereby attenuating GS levels and continuously suppressing CNV. CAELN exhibited spherical and uniform dispersion. In vitro cellular investigations demonstrated gene editing efficiencies of CAELN ranging from 42.05 to 55.02% and its capacity to inhibit neovascularization in HUVEC cells. Moreover, in vivo pharmacodynamic studies conducted in CNV rabbits revealed efficacy of CAELN in restoring the thickness of intra- and extranuclear tissues. The findings suggest that GS is a novel target for the inhibition of pathological CNV, while the development of AS1411-modified exosome-liposome hybrid nanoparticles represents a novel delivery method for the treatment of neovascular-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "Glutamine plays an important role in tumor metabolism. It is known that the core region of solid tumors is deprived of glutamine, which affects tumor growth and spread. Here we investigated the effect of glutamine deprivation on cellular metabolism and sensitivity of human glioblastoma cells U87MG and T98G to drugs of various origin: alkylating cytostatic agent temozolomide; cytokine TRAIL DR5-B - agonist of the DR5 receptor; and GMX1778 - a targeted inhibitor of the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), limiting NAD biosynthesis. Bioinformatics analysis of the cell transcriptomes showed that U87MG cells have a more differentiated phenotype than T98G, and also differ in the expression profile of the genes associated with glutamine metabolism. Upon glutamine deprivation, growth rate of the U87MG and T98G cells decreased. Analysis of cellular metabolism by FLIM microscopy of NADH as well as assessment of lactate content in the medium showed that glutamine deprivation shifted metabolic status of the U87MG cells towards glycolysis. This was accompanied by the increase in expression of the stemness marker CD133, which collectively could indicate de-differentiation of these cells. At the same time, we observed increase in both expression of the DR5 receptor and sensitivity of the U87MG cells to DR5-B. On the contrary, glutamine deprivation of T98G cells induced metabolic shift towards oxidative phosphorylation, decrease in the DR5 expression and resistance to DR5-B. The effects of NAMPT inhibition also differed between the two cell lines and were opposite to the effects of DR5-B: upon glutamine deprivation, U87MG cells acquired resistance, while T98G cells were sensitized to GMX1778. Thus, phenotypic and metabolic differences between the two human glioblastoma cell lines caused divergent metabolic changes and contrasting responses to different targeted drugs during glutamine deprivation. These data should be considered when developing treatment strategies for glioblastoma via drug-mediated deprivation of amino acids, as well as when exploring novel therapeutic targets.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC), which remains the most prevalent malignancy among women, is characterised by significant heterogeneity across its molecular subtypes. Oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) (luminal) BC represents approximately 75% of cases, and despite advancements in treatment there remains around a 40% recurrence rate. Cellular uptake of glutamine is conducted by solute carriers (SLCs), which are significantly associated with outcome in luminal BC. In this study, differential gene expression analysis was carried out using The Cancer Genome Atlas BC dataset. This identified hydroxyacid oxidase 1 (HAO1) as significantly overexpressed in luminal BC with a high expression of SLCs. Extended analysis in the METABRIC (n = 1980) and Breast Cancer Gene-Expression Miner (n = 4421) transcriptomic databases and the Nottingham (n = 952) BC tissue cohort showed a varied survival outcome for HAO1 expression at the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic levels. HAO1 copy number (CN) gain (p = 0.002) and high HAO1 protein expression (p = 0.019) were associated with poor prognosis in luminal BC, whereas high HAO1 mRNA expression correlated with better survival outcomes (p = 0.023) suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism affecting HAO1 at different biological levels. Importantly, in luminal BC patients treated with endocrine therapy, high protein expression of HAO1 predicted shorter distant-metastasis free survival (p = 0.042). The knockdown of SLC1A5 and SLC7A5 significantly reduced HAO1 expression in MCF-7 and ZR-751 BC cell lines. Protein analysis confirmed significant associations between HAO1 and SLC7A5 and SLC1A5, emphasising a potential role for the enzyme in glutamine metabolism and its potential as a therapeutic target. This study underscores the prognostic significance of HAO1 in luminal BC and its relationship with patient outcomes.",

Herein, based on the heterogeneous metabolic characteristics of glutamine (Gln) addiction in pancreatic cancer cells, an iron-delivery system (IDS) with enhanced endocytosis is designed for efficient ferroptosis therapy. The IDS is characterized by Gln modification and can be recognized as a source of Gln nutrients for efficient endocytic uptake by pancreatic tumor cells. Because the IDS is flexible to combine with amino acid-like components, the IDS with enhanced endocytosis is further produced by loading the Gln transporter inhibitor of V9302. V9302 is capable of suppressing molecular Gln uptake via transporter ASCT2, which generates Gln deprivation to direct metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells and enhances cellular uptake of Gln-modified IDS via RAS-stimulated macropinocytosis. The enhanced endocytosis and high iron content of IDS facilitate ferroptosis in mice pancreatic tumor models; thus, an amino acid-like ferroptosis inducer of l-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) is further combined. The enhanced endocytosis resulting from the synergism of Gln and V9302 enables the efficient delivery of iron and BSO for ferroptosis tumor therapy. This work provides an alternative approach for enhancing intracellular drug delivery of the tumors with heterogeneous nutrient metabolism by virtue of combining nutrient-modified nanodrugs with the corresponding nutrient transporter inhibitors.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Solute carrier family 38 member 5 (SLC38A5) is an amino acid transporter that plays a significant role in various cellular biological processes and may be involved in regulating the progression of tumors However, its function and underlying mechanism in osteosarcoma remain unexplored. METHODS: Utilizing various database analyses and experiments, we have explored the dysregulation of SLC38A5 in osteosarcoma and its prognostic value. A series of in vitro functional experiments, including CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, and transwell invasion assays, were conducted to evaluate the effects of SLC38A5 on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. Downstream pathways of SLC38A5 were explored through methods such as western blot and metabolic assays, followed by a series of validations. Finally, we constructed a subcutaneous xenograft tumor model in nude mice to explore SLC38A5 function in vivo. RESULTS: SLC38A5 is upregulated in osteosarcoma and is associated with poor prognosis in patients. Upregulation of SLC38A5 promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion of osteosarcoma cells, while the PI3K inhibitor BKM120 can counteract these effects. Additionally, silencing of SLC38A5 inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, SLC38A5 mediates the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by transporting glutamine, which subsequently enhances the SREBP1/SCD-1 signaling pathway, thereby suppressing ferroptosis in osteosarcoma cells. CONCLUSION: SLC38A5 promotes osteosarcoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via the glutamine-mediated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and inhibits ferroptosis. Targeting SLC38A5 and the PI3K/AKT signaling axis may provide a meaningful therapeutic strategy for the future treatment of osteosarcoma.",

However, its role in asthma-related lung injuries remains underexplored. This study investigates the mechanisms by which Ala-Gln modulates sDPP4-induced airway epithelial-mesenchymal transition and ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma in a mouse model. METHODS: An asthma model was established in female C57BL/6 J mice by using OVA. CD4+ T cells and bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) were isolated from the spleen and bronchi of the mice, respectively. Interventions included recombinant sCD26/sDPP4 protein, Ala-Gln, and EX527 (a SIRT1 inhibitor). Flow cytometry was used to assess Th17 and Treg cell populations. Mice were treated with Ala-Gln, EX527, and budesonide (BUD). Histopathological changes in lung tissues were evaluated using hematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining. White blood cell counts were measured with a hematology analyzer. The expression levels of DPP4, IL-17, SIRT1, SMAD2/3, N-cadherin, E-cadherin, MMP9, and α-SMA proteins were analyzed. RESULTS: Treatment with recombinant sCD26/sDPP4 resulted in decreased E-cadherin expression in BECs and increased levels of α-SMA, MMP9, and N-cadherin, effects that were mitigated by Ala-Gln. Ala-Gln also prevented the reduction in SIRT1 expression in BECs and the increase in Th17 cell differentiation induced by recombinant sCD26/sDPP4. EX527 administration alongside Ala-Gln reversed these changes and enhanced the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 through SIRT1 signaling. BUD alone reduced inflammation and fibrosis in bronchial tissue and lowered the Th17/Treg ratio in peribronchial lymph nodes. The therapeutic effect of BUD was further improved with concurrent Ala-Gln treatment. CONCLUSION: Ala-Gln can inhibit BEC fibrosis and Th17 cell differentiation mediated by recombinant sCD26/sDPP4 through the SIRT1 pathway. Combined with BUD, Ala-Gln enhanced therapeutic efficacy in OVA-induced asthma in mice, which could offer improved outcomes for asthmatic patients with elevated DPP4 levels.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rapidly progressing blood cancer. The prognosis of AML can be challenging, emphasizing the need for ongoing research and innovative approaches to improve outcomes in individuals affected by this formidable hematologic malignancy. METHODS: In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from AML patients to investigate the impact of L-glutamine metabolism-related genes on disease progression. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed increased glutamine-related activity in CD34 + pre-B cells, suggesting a potential regulatory role in tumorigenesis and AML progression. Furthermore, intercellular communication analysis revealed a significant signaling pathway involving macrophage migration inhibitory factor signaling through CD74 + CD44 within CD34 + pre-B cells, which transmit signals to pre-dendritic cells and monocytes. Ligands for this pathway were predominantly expressed in stromal cells, naïve T cells, and CD34 + pre-B cells. CD74, the pertinent receptor, was predominantly detected in a variety of cellular components, including stromal cells, pre-dendritic cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and hematopoietic progenitors. The study's results provide insights into the possible interplay among these cell types and their collective contribution to the pathogenesis of AML. Moreover, we identified 10 genes associated with AML prognosis, including CCL5, CD52, CFD, FABP5, LGALS1, NUCB2, PSAP, S100A4, SPINK2, and VCAN. Among these, CCL5 and CD52 have been implicated in AML progression and are potential therapeutic targets. CONCLUSIONS: This thorough examination of AML biology significantly deepens our grasp of the disease and presents pivotal information that could guide the creation of innovative treatment strategies for AML patients.",

      "abstract": "During sterile inflammation, tissue damage induces excessive activation and infiltration of neutrophils into tissues, where they critically contribute to organ dysfunction. Tight regulation of neutrophil migration and their effector functions is crucial to prevent overshooting immune responses. Neutrophils utilize more glutamine, the most abundant free α-amino acid in the human blood, than other leukocytes. However, under inflammatory conditions, the body's requirements exceed its ability to produce sufficient amounts of glutamine. This study investigates the impact of glutamine on neutrophil recruitment and their key effector functions. Glutamine treatment effectively reduced neutrophil activation by modulating β2-integrin activity and chemotaxis in vitro. In a murine in vivo model of sterile inflammation induced by renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, glutamine administration significantly attenuated neutrophil recruitment into injured kidneys. Transcriptomic analysis revealed, glutamine induces transcriptomic reprograming in murine neutrophils, thus improving mitochondrial functionality and glutathione metabolism. Further, glutamine influenced key neutrophil effector functions, leading to decreased production of reactive oxygen species and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Mechanistically, we used a transglutaminase 2 inhibitor to identify transglutaminase 2 as a downstream mediator of glutamine effects on neutrophils. In conclusion, our findings suggest that glutamine diminishes activation and recruitment of neutrophils and thus identify glutamine as a potent means to curb overshooting neutrophil responses during sterile inflammation.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to elucidate the role of the glutamate-glutamine cycle in this mechanism and test the effect of ceftriaxone, a glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) enhancer, on seizure susceptibility in the Tg2576 mouse model of AD. METHODS: First, we assessed expression levels of key proteins in the glutamate-glutamine cycle in Tg2576 (n = 7) and wild-type littermates (n = 7), and subsequently in the kindling model of epilepsy (n = 6) and sham (n = 6). Then, kindling susceptibility was assessed in three groups: 200 mg/kg ceftriaxone-treated Tg2576 (Tg-Ceft, n = 9); saline-treated Tg2576 (Tg-Sal, n = 9); and saline-treated wild-type (WT-Sal, n = 15). Mice were treated for seven days before kindling, and seizure susceptibility compared between groups. RESULTS: Protein levels of GLT-1 (p = 0.0093) and glutamine synthetase (p = 0.0016) were reduced in cortex of Tg2576 mice, compared to WT. Kindling increased GLT-1 (cortex: p < 0.0001, hippocampus: p = 0.0075), and glutaminase (cortex: p = 0.0044) protein levels, compared to sham. Both Tg-Ceft and WT-Sal displayed Class IV seizures in response to the first stimulation (p > 0.99), while Tg-Sal displayed Class V seizure (p = 0.0212 versus WT-Sal). Seizure susceptibility of Tg-Ceft was not different from Tg-Sal (p > 0.05), and kindling rates did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Disruptions to key components of the glutamate-glutamine cycle are observed in models of AD and epilepsy. However, increasing GLT-1 through ceftriaxone treatment did not influence seizure susceptibility in Tg2576 mice, suggesting this is not an effective strategy to lower seizure susceptibility in AD, or a higher dosage is needed.",

Scutellarein, a key component of Scutellaria baicalensis, also demonstrates anticancer properties in lung cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms have not yet been clarified. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the effects of scutellarein in the treatment of NSCLC and its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: This study explored the effects of scutellarein on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its mechanisms. A Lewis lung cancer mouse model was established to assess scutellarein's anticancer activity in vivo. Additionally, the compound's effects on cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and apoptosis were evaluated in vitro using A549 and H1299 lung cancer cells. Metabolomics analysis was conducted to identify changes in cellular metabolism due to scutellarein, while molecular docking and western blotting techniques were employed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of its anti-lung cancer effects. RESULTS: Scutellarein significantly inhibited lung cancer xenograft tumor growth. In vitro studies showed that scutellarein suppressed migration and colony formation in A549 and H1299 cells, induced cell cycle arrest, and triggered cell apoptosis. Notably, scutellarein profoundly altered amino acid metabolism, particularly affecting glutamine metabolites. It affected key glutamine transporters ASCT2 and LAT1, as well as glutaminase GLS1, leading to their reduced expression. CONCLUSION: Scutellarein effectively inhibits lung cancer growth both in vivo and in vitro by inducing cell apoptosis and downregulating the glutamine metabolic pathway.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: C6 glioma rat models were randomly divided into control and L-methionine sulfoximine (MSO) treatment groups. MSO was intraperitoneally injected once every other day for a total of three injections in the MSO group. We assessed the effect of MSO on tumor vascular permeability by tail vein injection of Evans blue dye. GS activity, glutamate (Glu) concentration, glutamine (Gln) concentration, and arginine concentration in tumor tissues were measured using the corresponding kits. qPCR experiments were then conducted to examine the effect of glutamate concentration on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor expression. Finally, the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) assay kit and the nitric oxide (NO) assay kit were employed to detect NOS activity and NO concentration changes, respectively. RESULTS: Increased glioma tumor vascular permeability was observed after intraperitoneal injection of MSO; MSO acted as an inhibitor of GS, leading to a decrease in GS activity; increased glutamate levels caused activation of NMDA receptors and further activation of NOS; additionally, elevated NO levels were detected in association with an increase in arginine and NOS.

      "abstract": "Glutamine is a major energy source for tumor cells, and blocking glutamine metabolism is being investigated as a promising strategy for cancer therapy. However, the antitumor effect of glutamine blockade in bladder cancer remains unclear, necessitating further investigation. In this study, we demonstrated that glutamine metabolism was involved in the malignant progression of bladder cancer. Treatment with the glutamine antagonist 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) inhibited the growth of bladder cancer cells in vitro in several ways. In addition, we observed inhibition of tumor growth in bladder cancer-bearing mice by using JHU083, a prodrug that was designed to prevent DON-induced toxicity. However, the antitumor immune effect of T cells changed from activation to inhibition as the administrated time extended. We found that both in vitro treatment with DON and in vivo prolonged administration of JHU083 led to the upregulation of PD-L1 in bladder cancer cells. Mechanistically, glutamine blockade upregulated PD-L1 expression in bladder cancer cells by accumulating reactive oxygen species, subsequently activating the EGFR/ERK/C-Jun signaling pathway. Combination treatment of JHU083 and gefitinib reversed the upregulation of PD-L1 in bladder cancer cells induced by prolonged glutamine blockade, resulting in the alleviation of T-cell immunosuppression and a significant improvement in therapeutic outcome. These preclinical findings show promise for glutamine metabolism targeting as a viable therapeutic strategy for bladder cancer, with the potential for further enhancement through combined treatment with gefitinib.",

Conjugation of metal nanoparticles with thiosemicarbazones has shown considerable anti-cancer potential. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) were synthesized, functionalized by glutamine, and conjugated with thiosemicarbazide (ZnO@Gln-TSC). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy imaging, energy-dispersive X-ray, DLS, and zeta potential were used to characterize the NPs. The toxicity of ZnO NPs, TSC, ZnO@Gln-TSC NPs, and oxaliplatin in AGS cells and ZnO NPs and ZnO@Gln-TSC NPs in HEK293 cells was investigated by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry, caspase-3 activity, and Hoechst staining assays. The intra-cellular reactive oxygen species level and expression level of the CASP3 gene in AGS cells treated with ZnO@Gln-TSC NPs were evaluated. RESULTS: The NPs were in the size range of 20 to 70 nm. The DLS and zeta potential were 374 nm and -31.7 mV, respectively. In MTT, the IC50 of ZnO, TSC, oxaliplatin, and ZnO@Gln-TSC NPs for AGS cells were 130, 80.5, 67.7, and 9.8 μg/mL, respectively, and the IC50 of ZnO and ZnO@Gln-TSC NPs for HEK293 cells were 215 and 150.5 μg/mL, respectively. Flow cytometry showed higher apoptosis in the cell treated with the NPs and TSC. Apoptotic features, including cell shrinkage, were recognized. A significant increase of 5.9 folds in the level of ROS was noticed. The activity of caspase-3 and the expression level of the CASP3 gene were increased by1.83 and 1.6 folds after exposure to ZnO@Gln-TSC NPs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the anti-cancer potential of ZnO@Gln-TSC NPs to be used for gastric cancer treatment after further in vitro and in vivo assays."

      "abstract": "Orthopedic implant infections (OIIs) present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, owing to the lack of methods to distinguish between active infection and sterile inflammation. To address this unmet need, d-amino-acid-based radiotracers with unique metabolic profiles in microorganisms have emerged as a novel class of infection-specific imaging agents. Given the pivotal role of d-glutamine in bacterial biofilm formation and virulence, herein, we explored the potential of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with d-[5-11C]-Glutamine (d-[5-11C]-Gln) for early detection and treatment monitoring of OIIs. In vitro studies confirmed an active uptake of d-[5-11C]-Gln by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) biofilm commonly associated with OIIs. In vivo evaluations included PET imaging comparisons with d-[5-11C]-Gln vs l-[5-11C]-Gln or 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoroglucose ([18F]-FDG) in a rat OII model with tibial implantation of sterile or S. aureus-colonized stainless-steel screws before and after treatment. These studies demonstrated that the uptake of d-[5-11C]-Gln was significantly higher in the infected screws than that in sterile screws (∼3.4-fold, p = 0.008), which displayed significantly higher infection-to-background muscle uptake ratios (∼2-fold, p = 0.011) with d-[5-11C]-Gln as compared to l-[5-11C]-Gln. Following a 3 week vancomycin treatment, imaging with d-[5-11C]-Gln showed a significant reduction in uptake at the infected sites (∼3-fold, p = 0.0008). Further regression analyses revealed a superior correlation of residual infection-associated radiotracer uptake with the postimaging ex vivo bacterial counts for d-[5-11C]-Gln (k = 0.473, R2 = 0.796) vs [18F]-FDG (k = 0.212, R2 = 0.434), suggesting that d-[5-11C]-Gln PET had higher sensitivity for detecting residual bacterial burden than [18F]-FDG PET. Our results demonstrate the translational potential of d-[5-11C]-Gln PET imaging for noninvasive detection and treatment monitoring of OIIs.",

Improving plant N use efficiency (NUE) is the most effective economical method to solve the above problems. The absorption and utilization of N by plants is a complicated process. Glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate synthase (GOGAT) are crucial for synthesizing glutamate from ammonium in plants. However, their gene family in pears has not been documented. This study identified 29 genes belonging to the GS and GOGAT family in the genomes of Pyrus betulaefolia (P.be, 10 genes), Pyrus pyrifolia (P.py, 9 genes), and Pyrus bretschneideri (P.br, 10 genes). These genes were classified into two GS subgroups (GS1 and GS2) and two GOGAT subgroups (Fd-GOGAT and NADH-GOGAT). The similar exon-intron structures and conserved motifs within each cluster suggest the evolutionary conservation of these genes. Meanwhile, segmental duplication has driven the expansion and evolution of the GS and GOGAT gene families in pear. The tissue-specific expression dynamics of PbeGS and PbeGOGAT genes suggest significant roles in pear growth and development. Cis-acting elements of the GS and GOGAT gene promoters are crucial for plant development, hormonal responses, and stress reactions. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis indicated that PbeGSs and PbeGOGATs showed differential expression under exogenous hormones (GA3, IAA, SA, ABA) and abiotic stress (NO3- and salt stress). In which, the expression of PbeGS2.2 was up-regulated under hormone treatment and down-regulated under salt stress. Furthermore, physiological experiments demonstrated that GA3 and IAA promoted GS, Fd-GOGAT, and NADH-GOGAT enzyme activities, as well as the N content. Correlation analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between PbeGS1.1, PbeGS2.2, PbeNADH-GOGATs, and the N content. Therefore, PbeGS1.1, PbeGS2.2, and PbeNADH-GOGATs could be key candidate genes for improving NUE under plant hormone and abiotic stress response. To the best of our knowledge, our study provides valuable biological information about the GS and GOGAT family in the pear for the first time and establishes a foundation for molecular breeding aimed at developing high NUE pear rootstocks."

Here, we tested the effect of the incretin mimetic liraglutide in DN in mice with early-stage type 1 diabetes bred in a standard laboratory or enriched environment. With a single i.p. injection of streptozotocin 150 mg/kg, we induced murine diabetes. Liraglutide (0.4 mg/kg once daily, i.p. for ten days since the eighth post-streptozotocin day) failed to decrease the glycemia in the diabetic mice; however, it alleviated their antinociceptive behavior, as tested with formalin. The second phase of the formalin test had significantly lower results in liraglutide-treated mice reared in the enriched environment vs. liraglutide-treated mice under standard conditions [2.00 (0.00-11.00) vs. 29.00 (2.25-41.50) s, p = 0.016]. Liraglutide treatment, however, decreased the threshold of reactivity in the von Fray test. A significantly higher neopterin level was demonstrated in the diabetic control group compared to treatment-naïve controls and the liraglutide-treated diabetic mice (p < 0.001). The glutamine/glutamate ratio in both liraglutide-treated groups, either reared under standard conditions (p = 0.003) or an enriched environment (p = 0.002), was significantly higher than in the diabetic controls. This study demonstrates an early liraglutide effect on pain sensation in two streptozotocin-induced diabetes mouse models by reducing some inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters.",

Although NLRP3 inflammasome activity is regulated by cellular metabolism, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we found that under the pathological conditions of AD, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia is accompanied by increased glutamine metabolism. Suppression of glutaminase, the rate limiting enzyme in glutamine metabolism, attenuated the NLRP3 inflammasome activation both in the microglia of AD mice and cultured inflammatory microglia. Mechanistically, inhibiting glutaminase blocked the anaplerotic flux of glutamine to the tricarboxylic acid cycle and amino acid synthesis, down-regulated mTORC1 signaling by phosphorylating AMPK, which stimulated mitophagy and limited the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, ultimately prevented the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in activated microglia during AD. Taken together, our findings suggest that glutamine metabolism regulates the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome through mitophagy in microglia, thus providing a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment.",

This study aims to investigate the impact of glutamine supplementation on intestinal permeability, considering its importance for immune function and nutrient absorption. The study adhered to the PRISMA protocol for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A systematic search was performed in four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) until April 2023 to identify clinical trials on glutamine supplementation and gastrointestinal permeability. Eligibility criteria included randomized placebo-controlled trials measuring gut permeability post-glutamine supplementation. Studies were included regardless of language or publication date. Data extraction involved study characteristics, intervention details, and outcomes. Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane tool, and statistical analysis utilized mean differences and standard deviations with a random effects model. Subgroup analysis was conducted to explore heterogeneity. The systematic review and meta-analysis included 10 studies from 1998 to 2014 with 352 participants. A total of 216 patients were enrolled in the intervention group, and 212 in the control group. The mean participant age was 46.52 years. The participants had different types of diseases in terms of their health status. Overall, glutamine supplementation did not significantly affect intestinal permeability (WMD: -0.00, 95% CI -0.04, 0.03). Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction in intestinal permeability with doses over 30g/day (WMD: -0.01, 95% CI -0.10, -0.08). The glutamine supplements were administered orally in all included studies. The meta-analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in intestinal permeability with glutamine supplementation exceeding 30 mg/day for durations of less than 2 weeks. Further investigations with varying dosages and patient populations are warranted to enhance understanding and recommendations regarding glutamine supplementation's effects on gut permeability.",

METHODS: The TCGA-STAD and GEO GSE62254 datasets, containing gene expression, clinical information, and survival outcomes of GC, were meticulously examined. Differential expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were employed to excavate a key module (MEturquoise), which was used to intersect with glutamine metabolism-related genes (GMRGs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to identify differentially expressed GMRGs (DE-GMRGs). LASSO and Cox Univariate analyses were implemented to determine risk model genes. Correlation of the risk model with clinical parameters, pathways, and tumor immune microenvironments, was analyzed, and its prognostic independence was validated by Cox analyses. Finally, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to validate the expression levels of MYB, LRFN4, LMNB2, and SLC1A5 in GC and para-carcinoma tissue. RESULTS: The excavation of 4521 DEGs led to the discovery of the key MEturquoise module, which exhibited robust correlations with GC traits. The intersection analysis identified 42 DE-GMRGs, among which six genes showed consistency. Further LASSO analysis established MYB, LRFN4, LMNB2, and SLC1A5 as pivotal risk model genes. The risk model demonstrated associations with oncogenic and metabolism-related pathways, inversely correlating with responses to immune checkpoint blockade therapies. This risk model, together with \"age\", was validated to be an independent prognostic factor for GC. RT-qPCR result indicated that MYB, LRFN4, LMNB2, and SLC1A5 expressions were remarkably up-regulated in GC tissues comparison with para-carcinoma tissue. CONCLUSION: The present study has generated a novel risk module containing four DE-GMRGs for predicting the prognosis and the response to immune checkpoint blockade treatments for GC. This risk model provides new insights into the involvement of glutamine metabolism in GC, warranting further investigation."

T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)-stimulated GLN uptake requires CARD11. However, the specific pathogenesis of AD via GLN uptake remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the association between dietary GLN supplementation and the CARD11 pathway in the pathogenesis of AD, focusing on T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th17 cell expression in AD. Herein, wild-type (WT) mice with house dust mite epidermal-sensitized skin exhibited increased expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin (IL)-17, whereas CARD11 deficiency impaired Th1 and Th17 responses at the same site. CARD11 is a key mediator of Th1 and Th17 expression in AD. Additionally, we suppressed mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, downstream of CARD11, to underscore the critical role of CARD11 in mediating Th1 and Th17 expression in AD. Further, dietary supplementation of GLN to CARD11-/- mice restored Th1 and Th17 responses, whereas inflammatory expression was reduced in WT mice, and p-CARD11 expression and mTORC1 signaling activity were increased in JPM50.6 cells and CARD11-/- mice. Upon inhibiting the GLN transporter, alanine-serine-cysteine transporter carrier 2 (ASCT2), we observed that the Th1 and Th17 response in AD was reduced. Conclusively, ASCT2-mediated GLN uptake improves the expression of Th1 and Th17 cells via CARD11-mTORC1 signaling pathway in AD, suggesting the potential of glutamine supplementation for AD treatment.",

In this study, we aimed to identify amino acid metabolites that were differentially expressed in PROM versus healthy controls (HC) using targeted metabolomics and further explored their mechanisms of action with in vitro models.Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established to recruit 50 PROM and 50 HC cases for targeted metabolomics analysis. Twenty-three amino acid metabolites were quantified in the secretions of the posterior vaginal fornix of pregnant women between 31 and 36 weeks of gestation. Glutamine (0.0216 vs. 0.037 μg/mg, P = 0.003, AUC = 72.1%) was identified as the most differentially expressed amino acid metabolite between PROM and HC groups, and had a negative correlation with the abundance of Gardnerella (r=-0.3868, P = 0.0055), Megasphaera (r=-0.3130, P = 0.0269), and Prevotella (r=-0.2944, P = 0.0380), respectively.In amniotic epithelial cell and macrophage co-culture model, Glutamine reduced inflammatory cytokines and chemokines expression and suppressed macrophage chemotaxis. In LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 inflammation model, Glutamine inhibited the expression of inflammatory proteins iNOS and COX-2, down-regulated mRNA transcription of TNF, IL-6, and IL-1β, and reduced the production of reactive oxygen species through inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway, and therefore demonstrated its anti-inflammatory effect. Furthermore, Glutamine protected amniotic epithelial cell from autophagy and stimulated its proliferation, therefore may intensify fetal membrane and prevent PROM in vivo.Our results suggested that low Glutamine level in vaginal secretion can be used as an indicator for PROM, and local Glutamine supplementation is a potential intervention and prevention strategy for PROM.",

The synthesized PAI exhibited superior photothermal efficiency of the IR780 even after assembling in water. As a functional carrier, PAI was used to load and deliver the glutaminase inhibitor CB839 to tumor tissue. In the hypoxic environment of tumor cells, the azo bond would break, triggering the release of cargo. Upon irradiation, the outstanding photothermal properties of IR780 resulted in tumor cell damage.

However, a complete understanding of the regulatory mechanism of M2 polarization of macrophages (Mø) in liver cancer is yet to be established. This study aimed to investigate the potential mechanism by which NEIL3 influenced M2 Mø polarization in liver cancer. METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis analyzed NEIL3 expression and its enriched pathways in liver cancer tissue, as well as its correlation with pathway genes. The upstream transcription factor of NEIL3, TFAP2A, was predicted and its expression in liver cancer tissue was analyzed. The binding relationship between the two was analyzed by dual-luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. qRT-PCR assessed NEIL3 and TFAP2A levels in liver cancer cells. Cell viability was detected by CCK-8, while CD206 and CD86 expression was detected by immunofluorescence. IL-10 and CCR2 expressions were assessed using qRT-PCR, and M2 Mø quantity was detected using flow cytometry. Reagent kits tested glutamine (Gln) consumption, α-ketoglutarate, and glutamate content, as well as NADPH/NADP+ and GSH/GSSG ratios. Expression of Gln transport proteins was detected using Western blot. An animal model was established to investigate the influence of NEIL3 expression on liver cancer growth. RESULTS: NEIL3 was highly expressed in liver cancer and promoted Mø M2 polarization through Gln metabolism. TFAP2A was identified as the upstream transcription factor of NEIL3 and was highly expressed in liver cancer. Rescue experiments presented that overexpression of NEIL3 reversed the suppressive effect of TFAP2A knockdown on Mø M2 polarization in liver cancer. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the knockdown of NEIL3 could significantly repress the growth of xenograft tumors. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that the TFAP2A/NEIL3 axis promoted Mø M2 polarization through Gln metabolism, providing a theoretical basis for immune therapy targeting the liver cancer TME.",

METHODS: Following hepatic ischemia for 1 h and reperfusion, liver tissue samples were collected at 0.5, 6, and 24 hours postreperfusion for fixation, embedding, sectioning. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and GS staining were performed. RESULTS: GS expression rapidly decreases in hepatocytes around the central vein after IRI, reaching its lowest point at 6 hours postreperfusion, and then gradually recovers.

Tumor cells take up a large amount of glutamine to meet their rapid proliferation requirements, which is supported by the upregulation of glutamine transporters. Targeted inhibition of glutamine transporters effectively inhibits cell growth and proliferation in tumors. Among all cancers, digestive system malignant tumors (DSMTs) have the highest incidence and mortality rates, and the current therapeutic strategies for DSMTs are mainly surgical resection and chemotherapy. Due to the relatively low survival rate and severe side effects associated with DSMTs treatment, new treatment strategies are urgently required. This article summarizes the glutamine transporters involved in DSMTs and describes their role in DSMTs. Additionally, glutamine transporter-target drugs are discussed, providing theoretical guidance for the further development of drugs DSMTs treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent studies have found that histone-modified genes play an increasingly important role in tumor progression. Lysine(K) specific demethylase 4A (KDM4A) is a histone lysine-specific demethylase highly expressed in a variety of malignant tumors, data showed that KDM4A was negatively correlated with the Bone Morphogenetic Protein 9 (BMP9) in breast cancer. And previous experiments have demonstrated that exogenous BMP9 significantly inhibits breast cancer development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We detected the expression of KDM4A in breast cancer and the relationship between KDM4A and BMP9 using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blot, and verified the interaction between KDM4A and BMP9 by ChIP experiments. At the same time, we also detected whether KDM4A had effects on the RNA and protein stability of BMP9 using actinomycin D and cycloheximide. Measurement of alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG) level by ELISA to observe the effect of BMP9 on glutamine metabolism in breast cancer cells. Nucleoplasmic distribution of KDM4A after exogenous BMP9 treatment in breast cancer cells were observed by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot. A subcutaneous xenograft tumor model in nude mice was used to study the therapeutic effects of exogenous BMP9 and KDM4A inhibitor (JIB-04) in breast cancer. CCK-8, conoly formation, Transwell, wound healing, and immunohistochemistry were used to monitor the growth of tumor and cell function. RESULTS: We found that KDM4A was abnormally highly expressed in breast cancer, and silenced BMP9 expression by removing histone methyl groups from the BMP9 gene region. Meanwhile, KDM4A could also reduce the stability of BMP9 protein. BMP9 inhibit glutamine metabolism in breast cancer, resulting in a decrease in its product α-KG, is confirmed by ELISA. Altered nucleoplasmic distribution of KDM4A due to decreased α-KG was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot. Animal experiments confirm that the combination of exogenous BMP9 and JIB-04 shows significantly better results in breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: KDM4A silences BMP9 expression by removing histone methyl groups from the BMP9 gene region, leading to further enhancement of glutamine metabolism, which contributes to malignant tumor progression. In addition, using JIB-04 in combination with exogenous BMP9 could inhibit the malignant progression of breast cancer cells and the growth of tumors more significantly."

      "abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)s in the tumour microenvironment (TME) modulate the extracellular matrix, interact with cancer cells, and facilitate communication with infiltrating leukocytes, significantly contributing to cancer progression and therapeutic response. In prostate cancer (PCa), CAFs promote malignancy through metabolic rewiring, cancer stem cell regulation, and therapy resistance. Pre-clinical studies indicate that targeting amino acid metabolism, particularly glutamine (Gln) metabolism, reduces cancer proliferation and stemness. However, most studies lack the context of CAF-cancer interaction, focusing on monocultures. This study assesses the influence of CAFs on PCa growth by manipulating Gln metabolism using colour-labelled PCa cell lines (red) and fibroblast (green) in a co-culture system to evaluate CAFs' effects on PCa cell proliferation and clonogenic potential. CAFs increased the proliferation of hormone-sensitive LNCaP cells, whereas the castration-resistant C4-2 cells were unaffected. However, clonogenic growth increased in both cell lines. Gln deprivation and GLS1 inhibition experiments revealed that the increased growth rate of LNCAP cells was associated with increased dependence on Gln, which was confirmed by proteomic analyses. Tissue analysis of PCa patients revealed elevated GLS1 levels in both the PCa epithelium and stroma, suggesting that GLS1 is a therapeutic target. Moreover, the median overall survival analysis of GLS1 expression in the PCa epithelium and stroma identified a \"high-risk\" patient group that may benefit from GLS1-targeted therapies. Therefore, GLS1 targeting appears promising in castration-resistant PCa patients with high GLS1 epithelium and low GLS1 stromal expression.",

      "abstract": "As a crucial amino acid, glutamine can provide the nitrogen and carbon sources needed to support cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Interestingly, different types of breast cancer have different dependences on glutamine. This research shows that basal-like breast cancer depends on glutamine, while the other types of breast cancer may be more dependent on glucose. Glutamine transporter ASCT2 is highly expressed in various cancers and significantly promotes the growth of breast cancer. However, the key regulatory mechanism of ASCT2 in promoting basal-like breast cancer progression remains unclear. Our research demonstrates the significant change in fatty acid levels caused by ASCT2, which may be a key factor in glutamine sensitivity. This phenomenon results from the mutual activation between ASCT2-mediated glutamine transport and lipid metabolism via the nuclear receptor PPARα. ASCT2 cooperatively promoted PPARα expression, leading to the upregulation of lipid metabolism. Moreover, we also found that C118P could inhibit lipid metabolism by targeting ASCT2. More importantly, this research identifies a potential avenue of evidence for the prevention and early intervention of basal-like breast cancer by blocking the glutamine-lipid feedback loop."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and debilitating respiratory disease with a median survival of less than 5 years. In recent years, glutamine has been reported to be involved in the regulation of collagen deposition and cell proliferation in fibroblasts, thereby influencing the progression of IPF. However, the relationships between glutamine and the incidence, progression, and treatment response of IPF remain unclear. Our study aimed to investigate the relationship between circulating glutamine levels and IPF, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis using the most recent genome-wide association study summary-level data. A total of 32 single nucleotide polymorphisms significantly correlated to glutamine levels were identified as instrumental variables. Eight MR analysis methods, including inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, constrained maximum likelihood, contamination mixture, robust adjusted profile score, and debiased inverse-variance weighted method, were used to assess the relationship between glutamine levels with IPF. RESULTS: The inverse variance weighted analysis revealed a significant inverse correlation between glutamine levels and IPF risk (Odds Ratio = 0.750; 95% Confidence Interval : 0.592-0.951; P = 0.017). Sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger regression and MR-PRESSO global test, confirmed the robustness of our findings, with no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: Our study provides novel evidence for a causal relationship between lower circulating glutamine levels and increased risk of IPF. This finding may contribute to the early identification of high-risk individuals for IPF, disease monitoring, and development of targeted therapeutic strategies.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer progression and metastasis are closely connected to changes in glucose and glutamine metabolism. While Novel (nua) kinase family 1 (NUAK1) and Novel (nua) kinase family 2 (NUAK2), which are two members of the AMPK-related kinases, have been associated with breast tumorigenesis, their role in the metabolic reprogramming that occurs during breast cancer progression remains unclear. Our research uncovers that NUAKs expression is significantly higher in breast cancer tissues and cell lines, and it is positively related to glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), glutamine metabolism, and a poor prognosis for breast cancer patients. We show that NUAKs significantly increase metabolic reprogramming, including aerobic glycolysis, PPP, and glutamine metabolism in triple negative breast cancer subtypes but only induce aerobic glycolysis and PPP in luminal breast cancer subtypes to meet the anabolic demands of rapidly dividing breast cancer cells. In contrast, the depletion of NUAKs has the opposite effect. Mechanistic insights reveal that NUAKs activate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which in turn upregulates the c-Myc transcription factor, a crucial regulator of glucose and glutamine metabolic gene expression. Moreover, we demonstrate that NUAKs enhance mTOR/c-Myc signaling pathways, leading to increased glucose and glutamine reprogramming, which supports rapid cell proliferation and metastatic potential in breast cancer cells. Importantly, pretreating breast cancer cells with mTOR inhibitors blocked the metabolic reprogramming and tumor-promoting effect of NUAK1/2. Therefore, targeting NUAKs may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of breast cancer.",

To address this gap, we conducted comprehensive RNA-Seq, proteomics, and metabolomics analysis of BLCA tumors from AA and EA. Our findings reveal a distinct metabolic phenotype in AA BLCA characterized by elevated mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), particularly through the activation of complex I. The results provide insight into the complex I activation-driven higher OXPHOS activity resulting in glutamine-mediated metabolic rewiring and increased disease progression, which was also confirmed by [U]13C-glutamine tracing. Mechanistic studies further demonstrate that knockdown of NDUFB8, one of the components of complex I in AA BLCA cells, resulted in reduced basal respiration, ATP production, GLS1 expression, and proliferation. Moreover, preclinical studies demonstrate the therapeutic potential of targeting complex I, as evidenced by decreased tumor growth in NDUFB8-depleted AA BLCA tumors. Additionally, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of GLS1 attenuated mitochondrial respiration rates and tumor growth potential in AA BLCA. Taken together, these findings provide insight into BLCA disparity for targeting GLS1-Complex I for future therapy.",

      "abstract": "Leukemia is an abnormal proliferation of white blood cells that occurs in bone marrow and expands through the blood. It arises from dysregulated differentiation, uncontrolled growth, and inhibition of apoptosis. Glutamine (GLN) is a \"conditionally essential\" amino acid that promotes growth and proliferation of leukemic cells. Recently, details about the role of GLN and its metabolism in the diagnosis and treatment of acute myeloid, chronic lymphocytic, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia have emerged. The uptake of GLN by leukemia cells and the dynamic changes of glutamine-related indexes in leukemia patients may be able to assist in determining whether the condition of leukemia is in a state of progression, remission or relapse. Utilizing the possible differences in GLN metabolism in different subtypes of leukemia may help to differentiate between different subtypes of leukemia, thus providing a basis for accurate diagnosis. Targeting GLN metabolism in leukemia requires simultaneous blockade of multiple metabolic pathways without interfering with the normal cellular and immune functions of the body to achieve effective leukemia therapy. The present review summarizes recent advances, possible applications, and clinical perspectives of GLN metabolism in leukemia. In particular, it focuses on the prospects of GLN metabolism in the diagnosis and treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. The review provides new directions and hints at potential roles for future clinical treatments and studies."

Safe and alternative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed 1 . A ketogenic diet has been shown to have anti-tumor effects across diverse cancer types but will unlikely have a significant effect alone. However, the diet shifts metabolism in tumors to create new vulnerabilities that can be targeted (1). Modulators of glutamine metabolism have shown promise in pre-clinical models but have failed to have a marked impact against cancer in the clinic. We show that a ketogenic diet increases TCA and glutamine-associated metabolites in murine pancreatic cancer models and under metabolic conditions that simulate a ketogenic diet in vitro. The metabolic shift leads to increased reliance on glutamine-mediated anaplerosis to compensate for low glucose abundance associated with a ketogenic diet. As a result, glutamine metabolism inhibitors, such as DON and CB839 in combination with a ketogenic diet had robust anti-cancer effects. These findings provide rationale to study the use of a ketogenic diet with glutamine targeted therapies in a clinical context."

They play an important role in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy monitoring. Splicing factor proline- and glutamine-rich (SFPQ) plays an important role in cancer growth and metastasis. SFPQ is not only more highly expressed in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells than it is in controls, but also highly expressed in cancer cells in patients with other solid cancers. Thus, a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting SFPQ was developed, in which the SFPQ protein is trapped by the first specific mAb coated on a microplate, and then recognized by a second specific mAb. This assay allows for the specific detection of SFPQ in the serum of patients with solid cancer. Regarding NSCLC, the serum SFPQ levels distinguished the non-cancer controls from the patients with NSCLC, with an area under the curve of 0.876, a sensitivity of 87%, and a specificity of 94%. The serum SFPQ levels were significantly elevated in the patients with NSCLC or other solid cancers. In conclusion, serum SFPQ could be a promising novel diagnostic biomarker for NSCLC and other malignancies.",

Pyruvate carboxylase (PC), an enzyme found in mitochondria, is said to play a role in the control of oxidative stress and the function of mitochondria. This research examined the function of PC and discovered the signaling pathways controlled by PC in myocardial IRI. We induced IRI using a murine heterotopic heart transplantation model in vivo and a hypoxia-reoxygenation cell model in vitro and evaluated inflammatory responses, oxidative stress levels, mitochondrial function, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In both in vivo and in vitro settings, we observed a significant decrease in PC expression during myocardial IRI. PC knockdown aggravated IRI by increasing MDA content, LDH activity, TUNEL-positive cells, serum cTnI level, Bax protein expression, and the level of inflammatory cytokines and decreasing SOD activity, GPX activity, and Bcl-2 protein expression. PC overexpression yielded the opposite findings. Additional research indicated that reducing PC levels could block the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and glutamine metabolism by hindering the movement of β-catenin to the nucleus and reducing the activity of complex I and complex II, as well as ATP levels, while elevating the ratios of NADP+/NADPH and GSSG/GSH. Overall, the findings indicated that PC therapy can shield the heart from IRI during heart transplantation by regulating glutamine metabolism through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway."

      "abstract": "Glutamine (Gln) is a non-essential amino acid that is involved in the development and progression of several malignancies, including prostate cancer (PCa). While Gln is non-essential for non-malignant prostate epithelial cells, PCa cells become highly dependent on an exogenous source of Gln. The Gln metabolism in PCa is tightly controlled by well-described oncogenes such as MYC, AR, and mTOR. These oncogenes contribute to therapy resistance and progression to the aggressive castration-resistant PCa. Inhibition of Gln catabolism impedes PCa growth, survival, and tumor-initiating potential while sensitizing the cells to radiotherapy. Therefore, given its significant role in tumor growth, targeting Gln metabolism is a promising approach for developing new therapeutic strategies. Ongoing clinical trials evaluate the safety and efficacy of Gln catabolism inhibitors in combination with conventional and targeted therapies in patients with various solid tumors, including PCa. Further understanding of how PCa cells metabolically interact with their microenvironment will facilitate the clinical translation of Gln inhibitors and help improve therapeutic outcomes. This review focuses on the role of Gln in PCa progression and therapy resistance and provides insights into current clinical trials."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a fatal disease with metabolic abnormalities. The dysregulation of S100 calcium-binding protein A2 (S100A2), a member of the S100 protein family, is connected to the development of various cancers. The impact of S100A2 on the LUAD occurrence and metastasis, however, has not yet been reported. The functional mechanism of S100A2 on LUAD cell metastasis was examined in this article. METHODS: The expression of TFAP2A and S100A2 in LUAD tissues and cells was analyzed by bioinformatics and qRT-PCR, respectively. The enrichment pathway analysis was performed on S100A2. Bioinformatics analysis determined the binding relationship between TFAP2A and S100A2, and their interaction was validated through dual-luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. Cell viability was determined using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). A transwell assay was performed to analyze the invasion and migration of cells. Immunofluorescence was conducted to obtain vimentin and E-cadherin expression, and a western blot was used to detect the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, GLS, and GLUD1. The kits measured the NADPH/NADP ratio, glutathione (GSH)/glutathione disulfide (GSSG) levels, and the contents of glutamine, α-KG, and glutamate. RESULTS: S100A2 was upregulated in LUAD tissues and cells, and S100A2 mediated glutamine metabolism to induce LUAD metastasis. Additionally, the transcriptional regulator TFAP2A was discovered upstream of S100A2, and TFAP2A expression was upregulated in LUAD, which indicated that TFAP2A promoted the S100A2 expression. The rescue experiment found that upregulation of S100A2 could reverse the inhibitory effects of silencing TFAP2A on glutamine metabolism and cell metastasis. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, by regulating glutamine metabolism, the TFAP2A/S100A2 axis facilitated LUAD metastasis. This suggested that targeting S100A2 could be beneficial for LUAD treatment.",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis is a chronic, age-related joint disease. Previous studies have shown that osteoarthritis develops during intrauterine development. Prednisone is frequently used to treat pregnancies complicated by autoimmune diseases. However, limited research has been conducted on the enduring effects of prednisone use during pregnancy on the offspring. In this study, we investigated the effect of excessive prednisone exposure on cartilage development and susceptibility to osteoarthritis in the offspring. We found that prenatal prednisone exposure (PPE) impaired cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis, resulting in poor cartilage pathology in female offspring during the adult period, which was further exacerbated after long-distance running stimulation. Additionally, PPE suppressed cartilage development during the intrauterine period. Tracing back to the intrauterine period, we found that Pred, rather than prednisone, decreased glutamine metabolic flux, which resulted in increased oxidative stress, and decreased histone acetylation, and expression of cartilage phenotypic genes. Further, PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis, while PPE caused hypermethylation in the promoter region of PGC-1α and decreased its expression in fetal cartilage by activating the glucocorticoid receptor, resulting in a reduction of glutamine flux controlled by mitochondrial biogenesis. Additionally, overexpression of PGC-1α (either pharmacological or through lentiviral transfection) reversed PPE- and Pred-induced cartilage ECM synthesis impairment. In summary, this study demonstrated that PPE causes chondrodysplasia in female offspring and increases their susceptibility to postnatal osteoarthritis. Hence, targeting PGC-1α early on could be a potential intervention strategy for PPE-induced osteoarthritis susceptibility.",

      "abstract": "Cancer poses a significant threat to human health and life. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) are effective treatments for cancer. However, the presence of metabolic reprogramming via glutamine in tumor cells limits their therapeutic effectiveness. Herein, we propose an effective assembly strategy to synthesize a novel metal-polyphenolic based multifunctional nanomedicine (Fe-DBEF) containing Pluronic F127 stable ferric ion crosslinked epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) nanoparticles loaded with GLS1 inhibitor bis-2-(5-phenylacetamino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-yl) ethyl sulfide (BPTES) and chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (DOX). Our study demonstrates that Fe-DBEF nanomedicine exhibits high efficiency anti-proliferation properties in pancreatic cancer through a combination of in vitro cell experiments, human organoid experiments and KPC animal experiments. Notably, Fe-DBEF nanomedicine can reduce the production of glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells, thereby reducing their resistance to ROS therapy. Additionally, excessive ROS production also aggravates DNA damage caused by DOX, synergistically sensitizing chemotherapy and promoting apoptosis for efficient treatment of pancreatic cancer. Overall, our findings suggest that inhibiting glutamine metabolism to increase the sensitivity of chemotherapy/CDT using metal-polyphenolic based multifunctional nanomedicine provides a promising combination of multiple therapeutic means for treating pancreatic cancer.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) represent the sub-population of cells shed into the vasculature and able to survive in the bloodstream, adhere to target vascular endothelial cells, and re-growth into the distant organ. CTCs have been found in the blood of most solid tumor-bearing patients and are used as a diagnostic marker. Although a complex genotypic and phenotypic signature characterizes CTCs, the ability to survive in suspension constitutes the most critical property, known as resistance to anoikis, e.g., the ability to resist apoptosis resulting from a loss of substrate adhesion. Here, we selected melanoma cells resistant to anoikis, and we studied their metabolic reprogramming, with the aim of identifying new metabolic targets of CTCs. Methods: Subpopulations of melanoma cells expressing a high anoikis-resistant phenotype were selected by three consecutive rocking exposures in suspension and studied for their phenotypic and metabolic characteristics. Moreover, we tested the efficacy of different metabolic inhibitors targeting glycolysis (2DG), LDHA (LDHA-in-3), the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I (rotenone), glutaminase (BPTES), fatty acid transporter (SSO), fatty acid synthase (denifanstat), CPT1 (etomoxir), to inhibit cell survival and colony formation ability after 24 h of rocking condition. Results: Anoikis-resistant cells displayed higher ability to grow in suspension on agarose-covered dishes respect to control cells, and higher cell viability and colony formation capability after a further step in rocking condition. They showed also an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition associated with high invasiveness and a stemness-like phenotype. Anoikis-resistant melanoma cells in suspension showed a metabolic reprogramming from a characteristic glycolytic metabolism toward a more oxidative metabolism based on the use of glutamine and fatty acids, while re-adhesion on the dishes reversed the metabolism to glycolysis. The treatment with metabolic inhibitors highlighted the effectiveness of rotenone, BPTES, SSO, and etomoxir in reducing the viability and the colony formation ability of cells capable of surviving in suspension, confirming the dependence of their metabolism on oxidative phosphorylation, using glutamine and fatty acids as the most important fuels. Discussion: This finding opens up new therapeutic strategies based on metabolic inhibitors of glutaminase and fatty acid oxidation for the treatment of CTCs and melanoma metastases."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: We recently identified a recessive syndrome due to DNA ligase 3 (LIG3) mutations in patients with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, leukoencephalopathy, and neurogenic bladder. LIG3 mutations affect mitochondrial DNA maintenance, leading to defective energy production. We aimed at identifying altered molecular pathways and developing possible targeted treatments to revert/ameliorate the cellular energy impairment. METHODS: Whole transcriptome analysis was performed on patient-derived fibroblasts total RNA and controls. Mitochondrial function, mitophagy, and l-glutamine supplementation effects were analyzed by live cell analysis, immunostaining, and Western blot. Patients were treated with Dipeptiven (Fresenius-Kabi) according to standard protocols. Patients' symptoms were analyzed by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire. RESULTS: We identified deregulated transcripts in mutant fibroblasts vs controls, including overexpression of genes involved in extracellular matrix development and remodeling and mitochondrial functions. Gut biopsy specimens of LIG3-mutant patients documented collagen and elastic fiber accumulation. Mutant fibroblasts exhibited impaired mitochondrial mitophagy indicative of dysfunctional turnover and altered Ca2+ homeostasis. Supplementation with l-glutamine (6 mmol/L), previously shown to increase mitochondrial DNA-defective cell survival, improved growth rate and adenosine 5'-triphosphate production in LIG3-mutant fibroblasts. These data led us to provide parenterally a dipeptide containing l-glutamine to 3 siblings carrying biallelic LIG3 mutations. Compared with baseline, gastrointestinal and extra-gastrointestinal symptoms significantly improved after 8 months of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: LIG3 deficiency leads to mitochondrial dysfunction. High levels l-glutamine supplementation were beneficial in LIG3-mutant cells and improved symptom severity without noticeable adverse effects. Our results provide a proof of concept to design ad hoc clinical trials with l-glutamine in LIG3-mutant patients.",

This study examines the role of glutamine metabolism in the microenvironment and prognosis of gastric cancer. METHODS: We obtained gene expression data and clinical information of patients from the TCGA database. The patients were divided into two metabolic subtypes based on consistent clustering. A prognostic risk model containing three glutamine metabolism-related genes (GMRGs) was developed using Lasso-Cox. It was validated by the GEO validation cohort. Additionally, the immune microenvironment composition of the highand low-risk groups was assessed using ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT, and ssGSEA. Drug sensitivity analysis was conducted using the \"oncoPredict\" R package. RESULTS: We outlined the distinct clinical characteristics of two subtypes and developed a prognostic risk model. The high-risk group has a poorer prognosis due to an increased expression of immune checkpoints and immunosuppressive cellular infiltration. Our analysis, which included Cox risk regression, ROC curves, and nomogram, demonstrated that this risk model is an independent prognostic factor. The TIDE score was higher in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group. Additionally, the high-risk group did not respond well to chemotherapeutic drug treatment. CONCLUSION: This study shows that modelling glutamine metabolism is a good predictor of prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy in gastric cancer. Thus, we can better understand the role of glutamine metabolism in the development of cancer and use these insights to develop more targeted and effective treatments."

      "abstract": "Asparagine and glutamine depletion operated by the drug Asparaginase (ASNase) has revolutionized therapy in pediatric patients affected by Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), bringing remissions to a remarkable 90 % of cases. However, the knowledge of the proproliferative role of asparagine in adult and solid tumors is still limited. We have here analyzed the effect of ASNase on three adenocarcinoma cell lines (A549, lung adenocarcinoma, MCF-7, breast cancer, and 786-O, kidney cancer). In contrast to MCF-7 cells, 786-O and A549 cells proved to be a relevant target for cell cycle perturbation by asparagine and glutamine shortage. Indeed, when the cell-cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry, A549 showed a canonical response to asparaginase, 786-O cells, instead, showed a reduction of the percentage of cells in the G1 phase and an increase of those in the S-phase. Despite an increased number of PCNA and RPA70 positive nuclear foci, BrdU and EdU incorporation was absent or strongly delayed in treated 786-O cells, thus indicating a readiness of replication forks unmatched by DNA synthesis. In 786-O asparagine synthetase was reduced following treatment and glutamine synthetase was totally absent. Interestingly, DNA synthesis could be recovered by adding Gln to the medium. MCF-7 cells showed no significant changes in the cell cycle phases, in DNA-bound PCNA and in total PCNA, but a significant increase in ASNS and GS mRNA and protein expression. The collected data suggest that the effect observed on 786-O cells following ASNase treatment could rely on mechanisms which differ from those well-known and described for leukemic blasts, consisting of a complete block in the G1/S transition in proliferating cells and on an increase on non-proliferative (G0) blasts."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The use of valproic acid (VPA) in the treatment of some psychiatric and neurological disorders such as bipolar disorder, migraines, and epilepsy is associated with hyperammonemia. However, the mechanism of this negative effect of VPA is unclear. In this study, we investigate gene glutamate-ammonia ligase (GLUL) polymorphisms for the glutamine synthetase (GS) enzyme, a key enzyme that catalyzes the removal of ammonia by incorporating it with glutamate to form glutamine, and we investigate whether it has a relationship with the emergence of hyperammonemia during VPA-based therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 180 Egyptian epilepsy patients in this study. Patient history, general and neurological examination and blood samples from arm veins were taken. Real time TaqMan PCR polymorphism for three polymorphism SNPs (rs2296521, rs10911021 and rs12136955) of GLUL was done. We assessed the relationship between the patient features, including three GLUL polymorphisms, and the development of hyperammonemia during VPA-based therapy. RESULTS: We found that the ammonia levels showed a positive correlation with VPA treatment duration (p = 0.015) and a negative correlation with carbamazepine total dose per day (p = 0.027) and with WBCs count (p = 0.026). Also, female patients having rs2296521 SNPs with the A allele and patients having rs10911021 SNPs with the C allele were at high risk for elevated plasma ammonia levels. Moreover, patients having rs12136955 SNPs with the A allele or associated hypertension as a co-morbidity were at high risk for elevated plasma ammonia levels. CONCLUSION: Female patients who have rs2296521 with the A allele, rs10911021 with the C allele, or rs12136955 with the A allele, are independent risk factors for elevated plasma ammonia levels during VPA-based therapy. Moreover, carbamazepine combined therapy may protect against the development of hyperammonemia in VPA-treated patients.",

Targeting these pathways to inhibit cancer growth is a strategy for cancer treatment. Critically, however, tumor-responsive T cells share metabolic features with cancer cells, making them susceptible to these treatments as well. Here, we assess the impact on anti-tumor T cell immunity and T cell exhaustion by genetic ablation of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and glutaminase1 (GLS1), key enzymes in aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis. Loss of LDHA severely impairs expansion of T cells in response to tumors and chronic infection. In contrast, T cells lacking GLS1 can compensate for impaired glutaminolysis by engaging alternative pathways, including upregulation of asparagine synthetase, and thus efficiently respond to tumor challenge and chronic infection as well as immune checkpoint blockade. Targeting GLS1-dependent glutaminolysis, but not aerobic glycolysis, may therefore be a successful strategy in cancer treatment, particularly in combination with immunotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Dysregulation of epigenetics is a hallmark of cancer development, and YTHDF1 stands out as a crucial epigenetic regulator with the highest DNA copy number variation among all N6-methyladenosine (m6A) regulators in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Here, we aimed to investigate the specific contribution of YTHDF1 overexpression to CRC progression and its consequences. Through multiple bioinformatic analyses of human cancer databases and clinical CRC samples, we identified GID8/Twa1 as a crucial downstream target of YTHDF1. YTHDF1 manipulates GID8 translation efficiency in an m6A-dependent manner, and high expression of GID8 is associated with more aggressive tumor progression and poor overall survival. Mechanistically, GID8 is intimately associated with glutamine metabolic demands by maintaining active glutamine uptake and metabolism through the regulation of excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (SLC1A3) and glutaminase (GLS), thereby facilitating the malignant progression of CRC. Inhibition of GID8 attenuated CRC proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. In summary, we identified a previously unknown target pertaining to glutamine uptake and metabolism in tumor cells, underscoring the potential of GID8 in the treatment of CRC.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Osteosarcoma, a highly malignant primary bone tumor primarily affecting adolescents, frequently develops resistance to initial chemotherapy, leading to metastasis and limited treatment options. Our study aims to uncover novel therapeutic targets for metastatic and recurrent osteosarcoma. METHODS: In this study, we proved the potential of modulating the YAP1-regulated glutamine metabolic pathway to augment the response of OS to DFMO. We initially employed single-cell transcriptomic data to gauge the activation level of polyamine metabolism in MTAP-deleted OS patients. This was further substantiated by transcriptome sequencing data from recurrent and non-recurrent patient tissues, confirming the activation of polyamine metabolism in progressive OS. Through high-throughput drug screening, we pinpointed CIL56, a YAP1 inhibitor, as a promising candidate for a combined therapeutic strategy with DFMO. In vivo, we utilized PDX and CDX models to validate the therapeutic efficacy of this drug combination. In vitro, we conducted western blot analysis, qPCR analysis, immunofluorescence staining, and PuMA experiments to monitor alterations in molecular expression, distribution, and tumor metastasis capability. We employed CCK-8 and colony formation assays to assess the proliferative capacity of cells in the experimental group. We used flow cytometry and reactive oxygen probes to observe changes in ROS and glutamine metabolism within the cells. Finally, we applied RNA-seq in tandem with metabolomics to identify metabolic alterations in OS cells treated with a DFMO and CIL56 combination. This enabled us to intervene and validate the role of the YAP1-mediated glutamine metabolic pathway in DFMO resistance. RESULTS: Through single-cell RNA-seq data analysis, we pinpointed a subset of late-stage OS cells with significantly upregulated polyamine metabolism. This upregulation was further substantiated by transcriptomic profiling of recurrent and non-recurrent OS tissues. High-throughput drug screening revealed a promising combination strategy involving DFMO and CIL56. DFMO treatment curbs the phosphorylation of YAP1 protein in OS cells, promoting nuclear entry and initiating the YAP1-mediated glutamine metabolic pathway. This reduces intracellular ROS levels, countering DFMO's anticancer effect. The therapeutic efficacy of DFMO can be amplified both in vivo and in vitro by combining it with the YAP1 inhibitor CIL56 or the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839. This underscores the significant potential of targeting the YAP1-mediated glutamine metabolic pathway to enhance efficacy of DFMO. CONCLUSION: Our findings elucidate YAP1-mediated glutamine metabolism as a crucial bypass mechanism against DFMO, following the inhibition of polyamine metabolism. Our study provides valuable insights into the potential role of DFMO in an \"One-two Punch\" therapy of metastatic and recurrent osteosarcoma.",

      "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stands as one of the most prevalent malignancies. While PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated promising therapeutic efficacy in HCC, not all patients exhibit a favorable response to these treatments. Glutamine is a crucial immune cell regulatory factor, and tumor cells exhibit glutamine dependence. In this study, HCC patients were divided into two subtypes (C1 and C2) based on glutamine metabolism-related genes via consensus clustering. The C1 pattern, in contrast to C2, was associated with a lower survival probability among HCC patients. Additionally, the C1 pattern exhibited higher proportions of patients with advanced tumor stages. The activity of C1 in glutamine metabolism and transport is significantly enhanced, while its oxidative phosphorylation activity is reduced. And, C1 was mainly involved in the progression-related pathway of HCC. Furthermore, C1 exhibited high levels of immunosuppressive cells, cytokine-receptor interactions and immune checkpoint genes, suggesting C1 as an immunosuppressive subtype. After stepwise selection based on integrated four machine learning methods, SLC1A5 was finally identified as the pivotal gene that distinguishes the subtypes. The expression of SLC1A5 was significantly positively correlated with immunosuppressive status. SLC1A5 showed the most significant correlation with macrophage infiltration, and this correlation was confirmed through the RNA-seq data of CLCA project and our cohort. Low-SLC1A5-expression samples had better immunogenicity and responsiveness to immunotherapy. As expected, SubMap and survival analysis indicated that individuals with low SLC1A5 expression were more responsive to anti-PD1 therapy. Collectively, this study categorized HCC patients based on glutamine metabolism-related genes and proposed two subclasses with different clinical traits, biological behavior, and immune status. Machine learning was utilized to identify the hub gene SLC1A5 for HCC classification, which also could predict immunotherapy response.",
