      "abstract": "In recent years, the interest of consumers in fruit juice extracts as nutraceuticals has increased. Fruits, especially red berries, contain valuable bioactive compounds such as polyphenols. Polyphenols are often associated with anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-cancer, cardioprotective and gastroprotective properties. However, the relationship between the various effects of fruit juice extracts and their influence on the permeability of the intestinal barrier, as well as their influence on glucose transport across the intestinal membrane, is not known. Therefore, in the present study, anthocyanins and copigments were obtained from 11 fruit juice extracts by XAD7 column chromatography and characterized their health-promoting effects, as well as their influence on the intestinal membrane. Chokeberry, pomegranate and blueberry extracts showed the highest antioxidant activity, but showed incomplete regeneration of the intestinal membrane upon treatment-induced higher permeability. This may depended on the high anthocyanin level of these extracts. Treatments with gojiberry extract, elderberry extract and the copigment fraction of apple achieved the best suitable regeneration of the intestinal barrier. The transcription of epithelial glucose transporters GLUT1 und GLUT2 as well as for the oxidative stress genes catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were most effectively reduced by chokeberry extract. To sum up, fruit juice extracts possess high antioxidant potentials and can reduce the expression of antioxidant enzymes and glucose transporters in colon cells. While the glucose uptake may be reduced, the intestinal permeability is increased, which varies due to the extract composition. Therefore, fruit juice extracts need to be fractionated and characterized in more detail to identify the health-beneficial compounds.",

      "abstract": "The issue of environmental pollution caused by wastewater discharge from fruit juice production has attracted increasing attention. However, the cost-effectiveness of conventional treatment technology remains insufficient. In this study, a gravity-driven membrane bioreactor (GDMBR) was developed to treat real fruit juice wastewater from secondary sedimentation at pressures ranging from 0.01 to 0.04 MPa without requiring backwashing or chemical cleaning, with the aim of investigating flux development and contaminant removal under low-energy conditions. The results demonstrate an initial decrease in flux followed by stabilization during long-term filtration. Moreover, the stabilized flux level achieved with the GDMBR at pressures of 0.01 and 0.02 MPa was observed to surpass that obtained at 0.04 MPa, ranging from 4 to 4.5 L/m-2 h-1. The stability of flux was positively associated with the low membrane fouling resistance observed in the GDMBR system. Additionally, the GDMBR system provided remarkable efficiencies in removing the chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), ammonia (NH4+-N), and total nitrogen (TN), with average removal rates of 82%, 80%, 83%, and 79%, respectively. The high biological activity and microbial community diversity within the sludge and biofilm are expected to enhance its biodegradation potential, thereby contributing to the efficient removal of contaminants. Notably, a portion of total phosphorus (TP) can be effectively retained in the reactor, which highlighted the promising application of the GDMBR process for actual fruit juice wastewater based on these findings."

      "abstract": "Peroxidase-mediated enzymatic browning during the process of noni fruit juice causes major color deterioration and precipitation, which negatively affects consumer acceptance of the juice. The purpose of this study was to understand the browning and precipitate formation mechanisms in noni fruit juice and improve its quality. Peroxidase was isolated from noni fruit via gel separation purification and characterized for its kinetic properties. The influences of key phenolic compounds on browning and precipitate formation were investigated via a noni-juice-based model system. The results revealed that the major noni peroxidase was a 50.05 kDa dimer subunit, and peroxidase activity was optimal at pH 6.0 and 30 °C, with an activation energy of 159.50 kJ/mol. Additionally, peroxidase activity was significantly inhibited by glutathione, sodium metabisulfite, and ascorbic acid. The active sites contained histidine and arginine residues. All eight phenolic compounds in juice act as specific substrates for peroxidase-mediated browning. Among them, gallic acid made the most significant contribution to both browning and precipitate formation. To effectively deactivate peroxidase activity while minimizing phenolic compound loss, a thermal treatment of 90 °C for 10 min was identified as the optimal approach. This study provides new insights into improving the quality of noni juice and enzyme browning.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dental caries has gained momentum as one of the main public healthcare concerns worldwide. Although the occurrence of dental caries in Uganda is on the rise, little attention has been paid to promoting oral healthcare in the country. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the citrus lemon extracts, and Mondia whitei root bark ethanolic extract as candidate alternative therapeutic agents for streptococcus mutans, the causative agent of dental caries. METHODS: In this study, the citrus lemon juice, pulp citrus lemon juice, and Mondia whitei ethanolic extract were screened for phytochemicals. Furthermore, the anti-Streptococcus mutans activity of the citrus lemon juice, citrus lemon pulp juice, and Mondia whitei ethanolic extract was determined by the agar well diffusion method while the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration were determined by serial broth dilution. RESULTS: Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and tannins in the Mondia whitei ethanolic extract and citrus lemon juices, while glycosides were only detected in lemon extracts. The zones of inhibition of Mondia whitei ethanolic extract, citrus lemon juice, citrus lemon pulp juice, and the cocktail were 13.67 ± 0.33 mm, 18.67 ± 0.33 mm, 18.33 ± 0.67 mm, and 18.00 ± 0.58 mm, respectively. The citrus lemon juice and citrus lemon pulp juice exhibited significantly lower MIC of 0.195 mg/mL, and 0.391mg/mL, respectively. The efficacy of the extract/juices increased with an increase in the concentration. CONCLUSION: The study findings revealed that Mondia whitei ethanolic extract and lemon extracts have potent antibacterial activity against streptococcus mutans, the main causative agent of dental caries; thus, can be further explored to formulate a herbal concoction for the prevention and treatment of oral cavity infections in resources-limited low-income communities."

This subfield of electrochemistry has the potential to be utilized in industry and analytical quality control, in general. This results in an increasing demand for trained personnel, capable of operating benchtop and portable electroanalytical equipment. Although electrochemical techniques are routinely taught in theoretical undergraduate courses, they need to be more often incorporated into experimental didactic activities. Herein, we describe the application of an effective, hands-on, and low-maintenance experiment that can enhance the learning experience of electroanalytical methods and their use in industrial quality control settings. This activity is based on the detection of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) by employing cyclic voltammetry at unmodified glassy carbon electrodes (GCE) in real juice samples. This didactic experiment teaches students about the theoretical concepts of cyclic voltammetry, three-electrode cell setup, chemical reversibility, data treatment, and quantitative analysis. This teaching approach was conducted in a second-year analytical chemistry course and was easily adapted to social distancing measures imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic."

This study focuses on uncovering insights into a novel pectin lyase, BvPelB, from Bacillus velezensis 16B, with the aim of enhancing fruit juice processing. The study examines the structural and functional characteristics of pectinolytic enzyme, underscoring the critical nature of substrate specificity and enzymatic reaction mechanisms. BvPelB was successfully expressed and purified, exhibiting robust activity under alkaline conditions and thermal stability. Structural analysis revealed similarities with other pectin lyases, despite limited sequence identity. Biochemical characterization showed BvPelB's preference for highly methylated pectins and its endo-acting mode of cleavage. Treatment with BvPelB significantly increased juice yield and clarity without generating excessive methanol, making it a promising candidate for fruit juice processing. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the enzymatic properties of BvPelB and its potential industrial applications in improving fruit juice processing efficiency and quality.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Various nutritional strategies are increasingly used in sports to reduce oxidative stress and promote recovery. Chokeberry is rich in polyphenols and can reduce oxidative stress. Consequently, chokeberry juices and mixed juices with chokeberry content are increasingly used in sports. However, the data are very limited. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of the short-term supplementation of a red fruit juice drink with chokeberry content or a placebo on muscle damage, oxidative status, and leg strength during a six-day intense endurance protocol. METHODS: Eighteen recreational endurance athletes participated in a cross-over high intensity interval training (HIIT) design, receiving either juice or a placebo. Baseline and post-exercise assessments included blood samples, anthropometric data, and leg strength measurements. RESULTS: A significant increase was measured in muscle damage following the endurance protocol in all participants (∆ CK juice: 117.12 ± 191.75 U/L, ∆ CK placebo: 164.35 ± 267.00 U/L; p = 0.001, η2 = 0.17). No group effects were detected in exercise-induced muscle damage (p = 0.371, η2 = 0.010) and oxidative status (p = 0.632, η2 = 0.000). The reduction in strength was stronger in the placebo group, but group effects are missing statistical significance (∆ e1RM juice: 1.34 ± 9.26 kg, ∆ e1RM placebo: -3.33 ± 11.49 kg; p = 0.988, η2 = 0.000). CONCLUSION: Although a reduction in strength can be interpreted for the placebo treatment, no statistically significant influence of chokeberry could be determined. It appears that potential effects may only occur with prolonged application and a higher content of polyphenols, but further research is needed to confirm this.",

      "abstract": "The worldwide market for vegetable and fruit juices stands as a thriving sector with projected revenues reaching to $81.4 billion by 2024 and an anticipated annual growth rate of 5.27% until 2028. Juices offer a convenient means of consuming bioactive compounds and essential nutrients crucial for human health. However, conventional thermal treatments employed in the juice and beverage industry to inactivate spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms, as well as endogenous enzymes, can lead to the degradation of bioactive compounds and vitamins. In response, non-thermal technologies have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional heat processing, with pulsed electric field (PEF) technology standing out as an innovative and sustainable choice. In this context, this comprehensive review investigated the impact of PEF on the microbiological, physicochemical, functional, nutritional, and sensory qualities of vegetable and fruit juices. PEF induces electroporation phenomena in cell membranes, resulting in reversible or irreversible changes. Consequently, a detailed examination of the effects of PEF process variables on juice properties is essential. Monitoring factors such as electric field strength, frequency, pulse width, total treatment time, and specific energy is important to ensure the production of a safe and chemically/kinetically stable product. PEF technology proves effective in microbial and enzymatic inactivation within vegetable and fruit juices, mitigating factors contributing to deterioration while maintaining the physicochemical characteristics of these products. Furthermore, PEF treatment does not compromise the content of substances with functional, nutritional, and sensory properties, such as phenolic compounds and vitamins. When compared to alternative processing methods, such as mild thermal treatments and other non-thermal technologies, PEF treatment consistently demonstrates comparable outcomes in terms of physicochemical attributes, functional properties, nutritional quality, and overall safety.",

However, sugar source may modulate the effects of sugars due to several mechanisms including the food matrix. The aim of this review was to assess the current state of evidence in relation to food source effects on the physiological responses to dietary sugars in humans relevant to cardiometabolic health. An additional aim was to review potential mechanisms by which food sources may influence such responses. Evidence from meta-analyses of controlled intervention trials was used to establish the balance of evidence relating to the addition of sugars to the diet from sugar-sweetened beverages, fruit juice, honey and whole fruit on cardiometabolic outcomes. Subsequently, studies which have directly compared whole fruit with fruit juices, or variants of fruit juices, were discussed. In summary, the sources of sugars can impact physiological responses, with differences in glycaemic control, blood pressure, inflammation, and acute appetite. Longer-term effects and mechanisms require further work, but initial evidence implicates physical structure, energy density, fibre, potassium and polyphenol content, as explanations for some of the observed responses.",

Thereafter, the blood glucose, blood pressure, and heart rate were repeatedly examined. Next, the participants completed consumption. After consumption, the participants underwent the same experiments performed before consumption. The total working ability scores after consumption were significantly high in both interventions (P < 0.05). However, PFJ intervention had a significantly higher working ability at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min than placebo intervention (P < 0.05). Moreover, PFJ intervention had greater increases in attention than placebo intervention. There were no significant differences in attention between two interventions. The blood glucose levels were significantly lower in PFJ intervention than in placebo intervention both before the working ability test and after the attention test (P < 0.05). A single consumption of PFJ improved working ability in healthy participants. This may be enhanced by improving attentional focus and maintaining postprandial blood glucose."

Antioxidant-rich foods, such as Aronia fruit, may counter inflammatory stimuli and positively modulate the gut microbiome. However, a comprehensive study characterizing the impact of Aronia fruit supplementation has not been completed. Therefore, we completed analyses measuring the metabolic, microbial, and inflammatory effects of a diet supplemented with Aronia fruit juice. METHOD: Humanized mice were generated by colonizing gnotobiotic mice with microbiomes from human donors presenting disparate inflammation levels. Blood and fecal samples were collected throughout the course of an 8-week dietary intervention with either Aronia juice or a carbohydrate-matched beverage alone (2 weeks) or in combination with a high-fat diet to induce inflammation (6 weeks). Samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing (stool) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (serum). RESULTS: We demonstrated transfer of microbiome composition and diversity and metabolic characteristics from humans with low and high inflammation levels to second-generation humanized mice. Aronia supplementation provided robust protection against high-fat diet induced metabolic and microbiome changes that were dependent in part on microbiome donor. Aronia induced increases in bacteria of the Eggerthellaceae genus (7-fold) which aligns with its known ability to metabolize (poly)phenols and in phosphatidylcholine metabolites which are consistent with improved gut barrier function. The gut microbiome from a low inflammation phenotype donor provided protection against high-fat diet induced loss of microbiome β-diversity and global metabolomic shifts compared to that from the high inflammation donor. CONCLUSION: These metabolic changes elucidate pathway-specific drivers of reduced inflammation stemming from both Aronia and the gut microbiota."

      "abstract": "The main goal of this study was to examine the efficiency of a newly isolated fungus from quince, Aspergillus tubingensis FAT43, to produce the pectinolytic complex using agricultural and industrial waste as the substrate for solid state fermentation. Sugar beet pulp was the most effective substrate inducer of pectinolytic complex synthesis out of all the waste residues examined. For endo-pectinolytic and total pectinolytic activity, respectively, statistical optimization using Placked-Burman Design and Optimal (Custom) Design increased production by 2.22 and 2.15-fold, respectively. Liquification, clarification, and an increase in the amount of reducing sugar in fruit juices (apple, banana, apricot, orange, and quince) processed with pectinolytic complex were identified. Enzymatic pre-treatment considerably increases yield (14%-22%) and clarification (90%). After enzymatic treatment, the best liquefaction was observed in orange juice, whereas the best clarification was obtained in apricot juice. Additionally, the pectinolytic treatment of apricot juice resulted in the highest increase in reducing sugar concentration (11%) compared to all other enzymatically treated juices. Optimizing the production of a highly active pectinolytic complex and its efficient utilization in the processing of fruit juices, including the generation of an increasing amount of waste, are the significant outcomes of this research.",

Pullulanase was produced via solid-state fermentation using wheat bran as the substrate. Purification and characterization included specific activity, molecular weight, pH and temperature optima, and substrate specificity. The enzyme was immobilized in sodium alginate beads and used for clarifying mosambi, apple, and mango juices. Parameters such as yield, clarity, reducing sugar, total soluble solids (TSS), total phenol, and enzymatic browning were evaluated pre-and post-treatment. The purified pullulanase had a specific activity of 652.2 U/mg and a molecular weight of 135 kDa. Optimal pH values were 6.5 and 10, with maximum activity at 50 °C. Pullulanase showed a high affinity for pullulan and starch, indicating Pullulanase type II classification. Immobilized pullulanase improved yield, clarity, reducing sugar, TSS, and total phenol in fruit juices. The highest yield and clarity were observed in mosambi juice. Additionally, the enzyme reduced enzymatic browning, increasing the lightness of the juice. This study provides a significant contribution to the juice processing industry and represents the first report on the application of pullulanase for fruit juice processing.",

However, there is a distinct lack of data relating to the effect of a combination of soluble and insoluble fibres in a convenient-to-consume fruit juice food matrix on gut microbiota structure, diversity, and function. Here, we aimed to determine the impact of the MOJU Prebiotic Shot, an apple, lemon, ginger, and raspberry fruit juice drink blend containing chicory inulin, baobab, golden kiwi, and green banana powders, on gut microbiota structure and function. Healthy adults (n = 20) were included in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, receiving 60 mL MOJU Prebiotic Shot or placebo (without the fibre mix) for 3 weeks with a 3-week washout period between interventions. Shotgun metagenomics revealed significant between-group differences in alpha and beta diversity. In addition, the relative abundance of the phyla Actinobacteria and Desulfobacteria was significantly increased as a result of the prebiotic intervention. Nine species were observed to be differentially abundant (uncorrected p-value of <0.05) as a result of the prebiotic treatment. Of these, Bifidobacterium adolescentis and CAG-81 sp900066785 (Lachnospiraceae) were present at increased abundance relative to baseline. Additionally, KEGG analysis showed an increased abundance in pathways associated with arginine biosynthesis and phenylacetate degradation during the prebiotic treatment. Our results show the effects of the daily consumption of 60 mL MOJU Prebiotic Shot for 3 weeks and provide insight into the functional potential of B. adolescentis."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia is generally defined as the high level of serum uric acid and is well known as an important risk factor for the development of various medical disorders. However, the medicinal treatment of hyperuricemia is frequently associated with multiple side-effects. METHODS: The therapeutic effect of noni (Morinda citrifolia L.) fruit juice on hyperuricemia and the underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated in mouse model of hyperuricemia induced by potassium oxonate using biochemical and high-throughput RNA sequencing analyses. RESULTS: The levels of serum uric acid (UA) and xanthine oxidase (XOD) in mice treated with noni fruit juice were significantly decreased, suggesting that the noni fruit juice could alleviate hyperuricemia by inhibiting the XOD activity and reducing the level of serum UA. The contents of both serum creatinine and blood urine nitrogen of the noni fruit juice group were significantly lower than those of the model group, suggesting that noni fruit juice promoted the excretion of UA without causing deleterious effect on the renal functions in mice. The differentially expressed microRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of hyperuricemia in mice were identified by RNA sequencing with their target genes further annotated based on both Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases to explore the metabolic pathways and molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effect on hyperuricemia by noni fruit juice. CONCLUSION: Our study provided strong experimental evidence to support the further investigations of the potential application of noni fruit juice in the treatment of hyperuricemia."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Impaired circadian rhythm (ICR) is a commonly used model of mild stress. The fruit juice of Chaenomeles japonica var. maulei (Mast.) Lavall'e (CMFJ) is rich in polyphenols known for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CMFJ on the behavior of rats subjected to ICR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats were divided into five groups of 10 animals each: control group (without ICR), the ICR, ICR+CMFJ2.5, ICR+CMFJ5, and ICR+CMFJ10 groups. ICR was induced by exposing rats to 14 days of constant light. Over these days, oral treatment was administered with distilled water (the control and ICR groups) and CMFJ at doses 2.5, 5, and 10 ml/kg for the respective groups. Then we performed the open field test, the social interaction test (SIT), and the forced swim test (FST) to assess rats' locomotion, anxiety, and the depressive-like behavior, respectively. RESULTS: The ICR animals increased their horizontal and vertical locomotion when compared to the controls. The ICR rats did not change significantly the social interaction time in the SIT test and immobility time in the FST. The horizontal and vertical activity of the ICR+CMFJ10 rats was reduced in comparison with ICR animals. Compared to ICR rats, the animals treated with CMFJ at doses of 2.5 and 10 ml/kg demonstrated an improved social interaction and decreased immobility time in the FST. CONCLUSIONS: ]CMFJ prevented the development of ICR-induced hyperactivity and showed an anxiolytic-like and antidepressant-like effect, probably due to its high polyphenol content.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress and inflammation play key roles in the pathophysiology in the pathophysiology of dyslipidemia, which are positive risks that increase atherosclerosis leading to important healthcare problems. Therefore, we aimed to study the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and lipid-lowering effects of jelly drink containing polyphenol-rich roselle calyces extract and passion fruit juice with pulp concentrate (RP jelly drink) in comparison to a placebo jelly drink for 8 weeks. Forty-three adults with dyslipidemia were randomly assigned into two groups: the RP jelly drink group and the placebo group. Glucose, total cholesterol (TC) triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), oxidative stress biomarkers, inflammatory parameters, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) were measured with fasting blood samples at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks of intervention. Results showed a significant decrease in LDL-C and TG, respectively, after 8 weeks of RP jelly drink consumption (LDL-C: 107.63 ± 22.98 mg/dL; TG: 109.79 ± 38.83 mg/dL) compared to baseline measurements (LDL-C: 128.43 ± 32.74 mg/dL; TG: 132.33 ± 75.11 mg/dL). These may be possible due to reduced inflammation and improvements in oxidative stress, as demonstrated by the reduction of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) α and malondialdehyde (MDA), and the enhancement of glutathione (GSH) after consuming the RP jelly drink for 8 weeks. However, no significant differences of treatment on glucose, total cholesterol, MCP-1, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10 were observed. In conclusion, daily consumption of RP jelly drink for 8 weeks resulted in significant improvement in lipid profiles in subjects with dyslipidemia. However, more research is needed to assess its nutritional and functional potential.",

Phytochemicals play a potential role in eliminating cancer therapy toxicity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of phytochemical-rich vegetable and fruit juice (VFJ) consumption in preventing CCRT-induced OM among patients with locally advanced HNC. METHODS: Forty-nine patients with HNC undergoing CCRT were enrolled. All patients received nutritional counseling before CCRT and weekly follow-up. The VFJ group (25 patients) received 600 mL/day VFJ, 5 days/week for two weeks preceding CCRT and during CCRT, and the control group (24 patients) did not. The contents of total polyphenols and carotenoids in the VFJ were determined. Changes in anthropometric, dietary, and laboratory profiles were compared. Assessment of OM was based on the World Health Organization (WHO) scoring system. RESULTS: Total polyphenols content was 64.6 mg gallic acid equivalents per 100 mL of the VFJ, and the main carotenoids were β-carotene and lycopene. The mean daily consumption of the VFJ was 538 mL for VFJ group. Changes in body weight, albumin, and energy intake were not significantly different between the two groups. The incidence of ulcerative OM was significantly lower in VFJ (64.0%) than in control (95.8%) subjects at week 6 of CCRT. Multiple logistic regressions revealed that VFJ consumption correlated significantly with lower risks of ulcerative OM. CONCLUSION: Consumption of VFJ rich in phytochemicals including total polyphenols and carotenoids effectively alleviates the severity of CCRT-induced OM among patients with locally advanced HNC.

      "abstract": "Cisplatin (CP) is an antineoplastic agent used to treat solid tumors, that has high nephrotoxicity caused by physiologic, hemodynamic, and biochemical alterations. Some studies have shown that naturally derived bioactive compounds in CP-induced nephrotoxicity reduce the side effects of this antineoplastic drug. Pitaya is an endemic fruit from Mexico with a high bioactive compound content, including betalains and phenolic compounds, with reports of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, the aim was to establish the effect of a pitaya juice concentrate (PJC) on CP-induced nephrotoxicity in Wistar male rats through the identification of metabolites, determination of its chemical composition and antioxidant activity, and evaluation of the protective effect of a PJC on CP-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. The PJC showed a high content of betanins with antioxidant activity by an oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay (1299.6 ± 2.80 Trolox equivalents/g). PJC was administered daily (400 mg day-1, p. o.) for 3 days before CP administration until the end of the experiment. On day four, rats were administered a single injection of CP (6 mg kg, i.p.-1) and sacrificed 72 h later. We observed that CP provoked renal dysfunction (1.0 ± 0.1 vs. 0.4 ± 0.07 serum creatinine levels), oxidative stress, a decrease in nitrate and nitrite (NO2¯/NO3¯) levels (0.1 ± 0.08 vs. 0.4 ± 0.3) and activation of apoptosis and immune responses in kidney tissue. In addition, CP treatment induced tubular damage threefold. PJC administration prevented renal dysfunction (0.5 ± 0.06 vs. 1.0 ± 0.1), normalized degenerative structural damage prevented the increase in lipoperoxidation levels (0.04 ± 0.01 vs. 0.2 ± 0.1) and reduced the apoptosis index by 2.5 in kidney tissue. However, it did not modify the immune response caused by CP. Furthermore, PJC treatment increased nuclear factor erythroid two related factors two protein levels two times and NO2¯/NO3¯ levels 22 times in kidney tissue, which may play a role in the renoprotective effect. In conclusion, the renoprotective effect of PJC on CP-induced nephrotoxicity was associated with the attenuation of dysfunction, structural damage, apoptosis activation, and oxidative stress and was related to changes in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha and renal nitric oxide (NO) pathways. The changes in the NO pathway may be involved in renal hemodynamics. Pitaya could be used as a functional food and therapeutic coadjuvant during CP treatments due to its high bioactive levels and renoprotective compounds.",

The aim of this work was to study the deacidification of fruit juices using electrodialysis (ED) with monopolar membranes. Aqueous solutions of citric acid were used in ED deacidification experiments following a factorial design with citric acid concentration and electric current varying in the ranges of 5-25 g/L and 0.5-1 A, respectively. The design runs were characterized by a constant Faraday efficiency of 0.37 ± 0.03, suggesting that the triple-charged citrate ion (Cit3-) carried the electric charge through the anionic membranes. During deacidification, the pH increased in agreement with the decreasing concentration of the acid. Deacidification of pineapple juice or pineapple juice enriched with 20 g/L of citric acid using ED led to similar values of the Faraday efficiency, confirming that Cit3- is the main ion migrating through the anionic membrane. However, the decrease in titratable acidity during ED treatment was accompanied by a decrease in pH. Such behavior, already reported, was explained by considering proton generation during the transformation of the single (H2Cit-) and double-charged (HCit2-) citrate ions into the triple-charged ion (Cit3-) when entering the anionic membrane."

In the present study, both a traditional culture-based method and Flow Cytometry (FCM) were applied to monitor the individual or combined effect of Origanum vulgare essential oil (OEO) and mild heat treatment on the culturability and viability of Escherichia coli in a conventional culture medium and in a fruit juice challenge test. The results obtained in the culture medium showed bacterial inactivation with an increasing treatment temperature (55 °C, 60 °C, 65 °C), highlighting an overestimation of the dead population using the culture-based method; in fact, when the FCM method was applied, the prevalence of injured bacterial cells in a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state was observed. When commercial fruit juice with a pH of 3.8 and buffered at pH 7.0 was inoculated with E. coli ATCC 25922, a bactericidal action of OEO and a higher efficiency of the mild heat at 65 °C for 5′ combined with OEO were found. Overall, the combination of mild heat and OEO treatment represents a promising antimicrobial alternative to improve the safety of fruit juice."

The efficacy of Cili in protecting alcohol-induced liver injury and its underlying mechanism was investigated. C57BL/6J mice received a Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet containing alcohol to produce liver injury. After the mice were adapted gradually to 5% alcohol, Cili (4 mL and 8 mL/kg/day for 4 weeks) were gavaged for treatment. The serum enzyme activities, triglyceride levels, histopathology and Oil-red O staining were examined. The RNA-Seq and qPCR analyses were performed to determine the protection mechanisms. Cili decreased serum and liver triglyceride levels in mice receiving alcohol. Hepatocyte degeneration and steatosis were improved by Cili. The RNA-Seq analyses showed Cili brought the alcohol-induced aberrant gene pattern towards normal. The qPCR analysis verified that over-activation of CAR and PXR (Cyp2a4, Cyp2b10 and Abcc4) was attenuated by Cili. Cili alleviated overexpression of oxidative stress responsive genes (Hmox1, Gsta1, Gstm3, Nqo1, Gclc, Vldlr, and Cdkn1a), and rescued alcohol-downregulated metabolism genes (Angptl8, Slc10a2, Ces3b, Serpina12, C6, and Selenbp2). Overall, Cili was effective against chronic alcohol liver injury, and the mechanisms were associated with decreased oxidative stress, improved lipid metabolism through modulating nuclear receptor CAR-, PXR-and Nrf2-mediated pathways.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of educational intervention in reducing the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and 100% fruit juice in children and adolescents. DESIGN: We conducted a comprehensive Ovid Medline and Scopus search. Articles had to be peer-reviewed, full-text and published in English. Studies had to be controlled intervention, published between 1 January 2010 to 7 February 2021, and in children and adolescents. Study quality was measured using the Quality Assessment Tool for Controlled Intervention Studies. RESULTS: Forty intervention articles were included in this review involving 25,069 children and adolescents. All studies employed a quantitative research method using the Randomized Controlled Trial designs. Twenty-eight out of forty interventions used psychosocial theories. Study quality ranged from 'fair' to 'good.' Results showed that education intervention effectively reduced SSBs, and reduced 100% fruit juice in children. EXPERT OPINION: Reducing the SSBs consumption in children should be initiated by conducting school-based programs consisting of interactive learning process, psychosocial theories and the involvement of parents or caregivers. Theories that focus on personal, behavior and environment factors improve the effectiveness of the intervention. More research is warranted to investigate the impacts of 100% fruit juice on obesity, dental caries and risk of co-morbidities in children.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In recent years, emerging evidence has highlighted the role of vitamin D as an iron absorption enhancer by suppressing hepcidin concentration, albeit with an unclear underlying mechanism. Dietary-based approach in improving iron status has been widely practised, however, there is a scarcity in randomized controlled trials (RCT) to elucidate the effect of vitamin D-fortified juice on iron status recovery. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of an 8-week vitamin D3-fortified fruit juice supplementation on iron status indicators in childbearing-aged women with marginally low iron stores. METHODS: In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, RCT, a total of 120 women aged between 19-40 with serum ferritin < 20 μg/l and fulfilled the eligibility criteria will be randomized into consuming either vitamin D3-fortified fruit juices containing 4000 IU (100 mcg) (vitamin D) or placebo-fruit juices (placebo) daily for eight weeks. At every 4-week interval, 10 ml fasting blood sample, information on dietary habit and anthropometric measurement will be collected. A mixed model repeated-measures analysis of variance will be performed to determine the effect of the intervention and the interaction with time points for all iron and vitamin D status blood biomarkers. DISCUSSION: Vitamin D supplementation in food fortification as a novel iron absorption enhancer might be a future and relevant alternative management of iron deficiency as opposed to the oral iron therapy that has poor adherence.

The optimum conditions for sonication coupled debittering using resin were 50 kHz, 2 min, and 45 ℃ while 50 kHz, 60 min, and 60 ℃ were obtained for enzyme hydrolysis. Sonication treatment not only reduced the debittering time but also enhanced the adsorption and hydrolysis of naringin by 17% and 20% in resin and enzyme respectively. In addition, enzymatic activity was also improved and weakened C-O bonds in naringin. At the same time, sonication significantly affected the bioactive compounds of juice, chemical composition, and volatile compounds of juice. Flavor compounds including octanal, linalool, citral, and ethyl butyrate were enhanced by sonication-assisted enzymatic treated juice."

      "abstract": "Xylanase enzyme has been classified as an enzyme belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family. The catalytic action of xylanase is focused on the degradation of xylan, a substrate for this enzyme comprising of a complex arrangement of monosaccharides interlinked with the help of ester and glycosidic bonds. Xylan represents the second most profuse renewable polysaccharide present on earth. Breakage of the β- 1, 4-glycoside linkage in the xylan polymer is what makes xylanase enzyme an important biocatalyst favoring various applications including treatment of pulp for improving paper quality, improvement of bread quality, treatment of lignocelluloses waste, production of xylose sugar and production of biological fuels. Most recently, xylanase has been exploited in the food industry for the purpose of fruit juice clarification. Turbidity caused by the colloidal polysaccharides present in the freshly squeezed fruit juice poses a setback to the fruit juice industry since the commercial product must be clear and free of excess polysaccharides to improve juice quality and storage life. This review gives an overview of the recent advancements made in regards to xylanase enzyme being used commercially with main focus on its role in fruit juice clarification.",

Compared with the model group (treated with MSU), mice in both the positive control group (treated with both MSU and colchicine) and noni fruit juice group (treated with MSU and noni fruit juice) showed a significantly decreased degree of paw swelling in 5 days, as well as the contents of two types of proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., NALP3 and TNF-α). Based on the next-generation sequencing technology, a total of 3896 microRNAs (234 known and 3662 novel) were identified in mice treated with noni fruit juice. A large amount of differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in the noni fruit juice group, suggesting the significant effects of noni fruit juice on the mice with acute gouty arthritis, while the different patterns of change in the numbers of both upregulated and downregulated miRNAs in both noni fruit juice and positive control groups indicated that the mice of acute gouty arthritis may be regulated by differential mechanisms between the treatments of noni fruit juice and colchicine. The target genes of microRNAs involved in the pathogenesis and pathology of acute gouty arthritis in mice were identified and further annotated by both Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. Our results revealed the therapeutic effects of noni fruit juice on acute gouty arthritis in mice with a group of microRNAs involved in the pharmacological mechanisms of noni fruit juice, providing scientific evidence to support both the agricultural cultivation and pharmacological significance of noni plants."

Currently, HPP has also been proposed as a useful tool to reduce food contaminants, such as pesticides and mycotoxins. The aim of the present study is to explore the effect of HPP technology at 600 MPa during 5 min at room temperature on alternariol (AOH) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) mycotoxins reduction in different juice models. The effect of HPP has also been compared with a thermal treatment performed at 90 °C during 21 s. For this, different juice models, orange juice/milk beverage, strawberry juice/milk beverage and grape juice, were prepared and spiked individually with AOH and AFB1 at a concentration of 100 µg/L. After HPP and thermal treatments, mycotoxins were extracted from treated samples and controls by dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) and determined by HPLC-MS/MS-IT. The results obtained revealed reduction percentages up to 24% for AFB1 and 37% for AOH. Comparing between different juice models, significant differences were observed for AFB1 residues in orange juice/milk versus strawberry juice/milk beverages after HPP treatment. Moreover, HPP resulted as more effective than thermal treatment, being an effective tool to incorporate to food industry in order to reach mycotoxins reductions.",

The electrocoagulation treatment processes were examined by using two electrodes of aluminum (Al) and two electrodes of stainless-steel (SS) and also by using Al as an anode and SS as a cathode. In addition, treatment by alum coagulation was investigated. Results showed that electrocoagulation was more effective than alum coagulation. The use of two combined electrodes of Al as an anode and SS as a cathode resulted in an 83.78% COD removal efficiency, while the use of the alum coagulant yielded 57.57%.

They were randomized to receive either TP 3-in-1™ juice (n = 16) or placebo (n = 15). Study subjects consumed 500 ml of beverages for three times per day, three days per week, for a period of ten weeks. Juice supplementation provided 9135 mg GAE of total phenolic content and 194.1 mg cyanidin-3-glucoside of total anthocyanin monomer.Results: There was a significant interaction effects on RAVLT immediate recall (p < 0.05) and Comprehensive Trail Making Test (CTMT) Trail 4 (p < 0.05). Metabolomics analysis showed the presence of metabolites related to polyphenols intake and cognitive functions with the intervention group showed increased urinary excretion of thyroxine and 3-methyladenine. Thyroxine and 3-methyladenine give stability to human transthyretin (TTR) and activate autophagy, respectively, which are associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.Conclusion: The result shows the potential of TP 3-in-1™ juice which is rich in anthocyanins in improving cognitive function, particularly learning, memory, processing speed, sequencing, mental flexibility and visual-motor skills domains, among middle-aged women.",

The objective of this work is to investigate the phytochemistry of the fruit juice of M. citrifolia on one hand and on other hand to evaluate its antiradical and antibacterial activity. The phytochemical investigation was carried out by tube staining tests of the extract of two types of fruit juice of M. citrifolia. The antioxidant activity of these juices was evaluated by reducing the DPPH radical method. Concerning the antibacterial activity, it was tested on the in vitro growth of 10 reference bacterial strains using the well diffusion method. Qualitative phytochemistry of M. citrifolia fruit juices revealed the presence of large groups of secondary metabolites including polyphenols, reducing compounds, mucilage and terpernoids. The antioxidant activity of M. citrifolia fruit juices is dose-dependent and higher than that of ascorbic acid. Antimicrobial activity on other hand revealed that fruit juices inhibit growth inhibitory activity of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, S. epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus oralis, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. This observed difference is significant for each juices on the strains (p < 0.001). These results support the use of M. citrifolia in traditional medicine and are the starting points for the development of a new drug to combat both dietary conditions and chronic conditions associated with oxidative stress."

Short-term intake of an anthocyanin-rich fruit juice resulted in significantly reduced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strand-breaks in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and affected antioxidant markers in healthy volunteers. Consequently, effects of long-term consumption of fruit juice are of particular interest. In focus was the impact on nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NFE2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2), the Nrf2-regulated genes NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) as well as effects on the gut microbiota. In a nine-week placebo-controlled intervention trial with 57 healthy male volunteers, consumption of anthocyanin-rich juice significantly increased NQO-1 and HO-1 transcript levels in PBLs compared to a placebo beverage as measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Three Nrf2-promotor single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), analyzed by pyrosequencing, indicated an association between individual Nrf2 transcript levels and genotype. Moreover, the Nrf2 genotype appeared to correlate with the presence of specific microbial organisms identified by 16S-PCR and classified as Spirochaetaceae. Furthermore, the microbial community was significantly affected by the duration of juice consumption and intake of juice itself. Taken together, long-term consumption of anthocyanin-rich fruit juice affected Nrf2-dependent transcription in PBLs, indicating systemic effects. Individual Nrf2 genotypes may influence the antioxidant response, thus requiring consideration in future intervention studies focusing on the Nrf2 pathway. Anthocyanin-rich fruit juice had an extensive impact on the gut microbiota."

The physicochemical and sensory properties of 3 mm slices of Japanese quince fruit (with skin, without seeds) obtained by osmotic pre-treatment in chokeberry and apple juice concentrates, and with the use of convection (convective drying, C-D), freeze-drying (F-D), and convection-microwave-vacuum drying (hybrid) are assessed. The methods of drying osmo-dehydrated slices do not affect the dry matter content. In most dried quince, the water activity is 0.40 or lower. Pre-osmotic dehydration and drying have a significant impact on the mechanical and acoustic properties of quince chips. Sensory attractive chips emit loud acoustic emission (AE) during the breaking test. Chips that are osmo-dehydrated in a mixture of chokeberry juice concentrate and sucrose and dried by a hybrid method are attractive. They have a dark red color given by chokeberry concentrate and a slight sweet (with a slight sour-bitter) taste. The sensory evaluation was useful for determining the quality of the chips in terms of their texture (crispness) tested by mechanical methods. Their sensory ratings (overall desirability as weight of color, taste, crispness, and flavor) are high and similar (from 3.8 to 4.1). The use of innovative drying methods with pre-osmotic treatment allows obtaining dried material with properties comparable to those obtained by the F-D method, but in a much shorter time, i.e., with lower energy and using a simple method.",

      "abstract": "Noni (Morinda citrifolia L.) fruit juice has been used in Polynesia as a traditional folk medicine and is very popular worldwide as a functional food supplement. In this study, compounds present in Hawaiian Noni fruit juice, with anti-inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells were identified. Five compounds were isolated using a bioassay-driven technique and phytochemical analysis of noni fruit juice: asperulosidic acid (1), rutin (2), nonioside A (3), (2E,4E,7Z)-deca-2,4,7-trienoate-2-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (4), and tricetin (5). The structures of these five compounds were determined via NMR spectroscopy and LC/MS. In an anti-inflammatory assay, compounds 1-5 inhibited the production of nitric oxide (NO), which is a proinflammatory mediator, in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of compounds 1-5 were investigated. Parallel to the inhibition of NO production, treatment with compounds 1-5 downregulated the expression of IKKα/β, I-κBα, and NF-κB p65 in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Furthermore, treatment with compounds 1-5 downregulated the expression of nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2. Thus, these data demonstrated that compounds 1-5 present in noni fruit juice, exhibited potential anti-inflammatory activity; these active compounds may contribute preventively and therapeutically against inflammatory diseases.",

However, no endo-polygalacturonase that both functions well at sufficiently high temperature and can be manufactured economically, has been reported previously. In this study, the cDNA encoding a thermophilic endo-polygalacturonase from Penicillium oxalicum CZ1028, was cloned and over-expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 and Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The recombinant proteins PoxaEnPG28B-Pp (from P. pastoris) and PoxaEnPG28B-Ec (from E. coli) were isolated and purified. PoxaEnPG28B-Pp was sufficiently thermostable for potential industrial use, but PoxaEnPG28B-Ec was not. The optimal pH and temperature of PoxaEnPG28B-Pp were pH 5.0 and 65°C, respectively. The enzyme had a low K m of 1.82 g/L and a high V max of 77882.2 U/mg, with polygalacturonic acid (PGA) as substrate. The performance of PoxaEnPG28B-Pp in depectinization of papaya, plantain and banana juices at 65°C for 15 min was superior to that of a reported mesophilic endo-polygalacturonase. PoxaEnPG28B-Pp is the first endo-polygalacturonase reported to show excellent performance at high temperature. An innovative process, including a step of simultaneous heat-treatment and depectinization of fruit pulps with PoxaEnPG28B-Pp, is reported for the first time."

PTI had a favorable inhibition with the low IC50 of 6.861 ± 0.107 mg/L. To explore stability of PTI against pH and heating treatment, PTI secondary structure was investigated by circular dichroism and inhibition was determined using the BAPNA method. The results indicated that PTI exerted a certain heat resistance and excellent stability over a wide pH range. Also, correlation analysis displayed β-sheet and β-turn contents of PTI had a positive correlation with inhibition, whereas α-helix and random coil contents were negatively correlated with inhibition. During in vitro digestion, the limited loss rate of activity (29.28%) and degree of hydrolysis (24.39%) suggested that PTI presented sufficient resistance to gastrointestinal digestion. These findings would extend beneficial hints to convert potato wastewater by-product into the potential anti-obesity ingredient in future.",

      "abstract": "Morinda citrifolia (Noni) is extensively used in herbal remedies to prevent and treat various diseases, including hypertension. The purpose of this study was to investigate the vascular effects of noni fruit juice and characterize the upstream signaling pathways. We measured the systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, 24-hr urinary nitric oxide (NO) metabolite excretion, bodyweight (BW), and urine examination in SHR.Cg-Leprcp/NDmcr (SHR/cp) rats after 6 weeks noni juice (15 ml/kg) treatment. Noni juice significantly decreased blood pressure and 24-hr urinary NO metabolite without change of BW or urine volume. Furthermore, the noni juice extract (NJE) promoted endothelial vasorelaxation in rat aorta rings and NO product through an increase in phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). NJE might act on a glucagon like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) via Ca2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ)-AMPK signaling with pretreatment of their inhibitors or antagonist in HUVECs. Deacetylasperulosidic acid (DAA) was an active compound in noni juice to improve NO release through same pathway in HUVECs. These results suggested that noni is a novel dietary plant that probably regulates GLP-1R-induced CaMKKβ-AMPK-eNOS pathway to improve endothelium-dependent relaxation, thus reduce the blood pressure probably via one of its responsible ingredient DAA.",

      "abstract": "Scorpionism represents a serious public health problem due to its increasing incidence. In Brazil, Tityus serrulatus is a species of major medical importance, especially in children and the elderly, as envenomation may induce serious acute pulmonary edema. \"Mangaba\" (Hancornia speciosa Gomes) fruit juice is popularly used in the treatment of several inflammatory disorders. The objective of this study was to analyze the chemical composition of fruit juice of H. speciosa by HPLC-DAD-MS/MS, as well as to evaluate its anti-inflammatory potential and antioxidant activity, and analyze the biochemical and hematological parameters in acute pulmonary edema induced by T. serrulatus venom (TsV) in mice. Mice were challenged with TsV (30 μg/kg, subcutaneously) and were treated with dexamethasone (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or fruit juice (pre- or post-treatment protocols, by intra-gastric route at 100 and 200 mg/kg), and 2 h later were anesthetized for blood, lung, and kidney collection, for several biochemical analyses. Results showed that the juice decreased edema, myeloperoxidase levels, vascular permeability, and production of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) in lung tissue. Also, the juice reduced the concentration of nitrite and malondialdehyde oxidative stress markers in renal tissue. Amylase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatine kinase seric levels were reduced when the animals were treated with the juice. HPLC-DAD-MS/MS analysis identified 13 phenolic derivatives. The results suggest that the juice was able to decrease the inflammatory effects induced by T. serrulatus, demonstrating that the use of juice can be relevant for the treatment of scorpion stings.",

Optimization of various fermentation process variables revealed that a moisture level of 70%, d-mannitol (carbon source), yeast extract (nitrogen source) and ZnSO4/NiCl2 as metal salt inducers generated the maximum yield of Exo-PG. After ammonium sulfate precipitation (70% saturation level), the enzyme was characterized in terms of various kinetic (i.e., temperature, pH, inhibitors, Michaelis-Menten constants) and thermodynamic parameters (i.e., Ea, ΔH*, ΔS* and ΔG*). The temperature and pH optima were 45 °C and 6.0, respectively, and the Exo-PG presented stability at a wider range of temperature and pH values. Metal ions Mn+2 markedly improved the enzyme activity, while exposure to urea and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid drastically inhibited the biocatalytic performance. The kinetic parameters i.e., km and Vmax were computed to be 10 mM and 41.67 U/mL, respectively. A profound increase in clarity, yield, and reduction in viscosity was achieved for different fruit juices (apple, mango, and peach) after treatment with Exo-PG. Total antioxidant and total phenolic contents were also ameliorated. In conclusion, the catalytic activity, thermal steadiness, and fruit juices clarification performance of Exo-PG manifests a great prospect for bio-industrial exploitation.",

Two formulations with different concentrations of acai, camu-camu, acerola, cashew apple, yellow mombin, and pineapple were pasteurized at 85 °C for 30 s, hot-filled in glass bottles, and stored in refrigerated conditions (5 °C). Analyses for color, total antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, carotenoids, ascorbic acid, and sensory quality were performed before and after pasteurization as well as at 90 and 180 day of storage. Pasteurization did not negatively affect the concentration of functional components and sensory properties. However, the storage time negatively influenced the sensory quality and reduced the ascorbic acid content of both the formulations. Further, the acceptability and the nutritional quality were still high in these products after 180-days of storage, thus, not preventing their consumption."

OBJECTIVES: To examine the associations of frequency of consumption of whole fruit and fruit juice with obesity and metabolic syndrome. DESIGN: This cross-sectional study used data from the 2012-2015 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 10,460 adults (4,082 men and 6,378 women) aged 19 to 64 years were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of consumption of whole fruit and fruit juice was evaluated using a food frequency questionnaire, and dietary sugar intake was calculated using a 24-hour recall. Obesity and abdominal obesity were determined using body mass index and waist circumference, respectively. Metabolic syndrome was defined on the basis of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the associations between frequency of whole fruit or fruit juice consumption and obesity and metabolic syndrome abnormalities. RESULTS: The percentage of participants who consumed whole fruit daily was 32.6%, whereas 52.3% consumed fruit juice rarely. The average intake of total sugars was 14.9% of total energy, which was within the recommend range (<20% of total energy) for Koreans. Consuming whole fruit ≥1 time/day was associated with reduced prevalence of obesity, abdominal obesity, and elevated blood pressure compared with consuming whole fruit ≤1 time/wk. However, frequency of fruit juice consumption showed no association with obesity, abdominal obesity, and metabolic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Frequency of whole fruit consumption was associated with reduced prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome abnormalities among Korean adults with average total sugar intake within the recommended range.",

The consumption of foods rich in polyphenols (e.g. anthocyanins) has been shown to exert preventive effects against such diseases. We investigated the biological effects of anthocyanin-rich fruit juice in a 9-week, placebo-controlled intervention study with 57 healthy male volunteers. The study design encompassed an initial 1 week of wash-out, followed by 8 weeks of intervention period with anthocyanin-rich fruit juice or placebo. The anthocyanin-rich fruit juice demonstrated DNA-protective and antioxidant effects; however, the placebo beverage, rich in vitamin C, showed similar effects based on the tested biomarkers. A significant reduction in background and total DNA strand breaks was observed in both groups within 24 h as well as after 8 weeks of intervention. Only anthocyanin-rich fruit juice consumption provided a significant reduction in body fat and an increase in fat-free mass. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was significantly elevated after consumption of anthocyanin-rich fruit juice. Both groups showed decreased levels of LDL and total cholesterol (TC) within the first week of the intervention. Similar results in both groups could be explained by the relatively high vitamin C contents of both beverages (>500 mg/L), which may have masked the effects of anthocyanins and other antioxidants in the studied juice. Taken together, anthocyanin-rich fruit juice as well as the placebo drink, both of which had high vitamin C content, can improve DNA integrity and might influence lipid metabolism in humans.",

The enzyme preparation was covalently immobilized on aluminum oxide pellets (3 mm) under statistically optimized conditions leading to 73.17% immobilization yield. The immobilized enzyme (Man-AOP) displayed enhanced thermal and pH stability. Man-AOP was characterized by FTIR, SEM and PXRD revealing a covalent interaction. The bio-conjugate was successfully recycled for mannooligosaccharide (MOS) generation from locust bean gum (LBG) up to 10 cycles, yielding an average of 0.95 mg MOS/cycle. Man-AOP was also effective in clarification of apple, kiwi, orange and peach juices and enhanced their reducing sugar content. The bio-conjugate was useful in generation of MOS from mannan and enrichment of fruit juices.",

      "abstract": "Moderate intensity Pulsed Electric Fields (PEF) was studied for microbial inactivation as an alternative to high intensity PEF or to classical thermal pasteurization. The process is characterized by the application of electric pulses, allowing an increase of the product temperature by the ohmic heat generated by the pulses. A systematic evaluation of the effect of parameters electric field strength (E) and pulse width (τ) on the inactivation of Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus plantarum, Salmonella Senftenberg and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in orange juice was carried out in a continuous flow system. A wide range of conditions was evaluated, and both E and τ were shown to be important in the efficacy to inactivate micro-organisms. Remarkably, PEF conditions at E = 2.7 kV/cm and τ = 15-1000 μs showed to be more effective in microbial inactivation than at E = 10 kV/cm and τ = 2 μs. Inactivation kinetics of the tested PEF conditions were compared to an equivalent thermal process to disentangle non-thermal effects (electroporation) from thermal effects responsible for the microbial inactivation. At standard high intensity PEF treatment a non-thermal inactivation at E = 20 kV/cm and τ = 2 μs pulses was observed and attributed to electroporation. Non-thermal effects could also be resolved with moderate intensity PEF at E = 2.7 kV/cm and pulse width between τ = 15-1000 μs. Microbial inactivation at these moderate intensity PEF conditions was studied in more detail at different pH and medium conductivity for E. coli and L. monocytogenes in watermelon juice and coconut water. Under moderate intensity PEF conditions the effectiveness of treatment was independent of pH for all evaluated matrices in the pH range of 3.8-6.0, whereas under high intensity PEF conditions the pH of the product is a critical factor for microbial inactivation. This suggests that the inactivation proceeds through a different mechanism at moderate intensity PEF, and speculations for this mechanism are presented. In conclusion, moderate intensity PEF conditions at E = 2.7 kV/cm and pulse width of 15-1000 μs has potential for industrial processing for the preservation of fruit juices and pH neutral liquid food products.",

Unfiltered and filtered pummelo fruit juices were treated with gaseous ozone for up to 50 min with ozone concentration fixed at 600 mg/h. A microbiological and physicochemical properties analysis were conducted on the ozone-treated fruit juices samples. It was found that the survival rate of aerobic bacteria, yeast and mold in unfiltered pummelo fruit juice were higher compared to filtered juice, as the juice components acted as protective barriers to the microorganisms. The microorganisms' inactivation in pummelo fruit juices was also observed to have increased as the ozone treatment time increased. Significant effects on total colour difference, ascorbic acid content, and total phenolic content were also observed over increased ozone-treatment time. However, ozone was shown to be ineffective in activating PME activity in both types of juice. The experimental results of this study indicated that pummelo fruit juice components had significant effects on the effectiveness of gaseous ozone, however, the degree of the effects depends on the different fruit components (total soluble solids, total phenolic content). As a conclusion, filtered juice showed better quality characteristics in comparison to unfiltered juice post-ozone treatment."

METHODS: Morinda citrifolia (Noni) fruit juice (NFJ), 2 ml per kg bw per day, was consumed by twenty patients with DT2 after they underwent a standard treatment regimen including carbohydrate reduced diet and treatment with an antidiabetic drug and/or insulin. NFJ consumption started only after no further improvement was achieved. The intake of NFJ was terminated after eight weeks. The fasting blood sugar level was monitored every morning during the entire treatment period. Blood samples were taken before, at, and four and eight weeks after the start of NFJ intake. The analysis of the blood samples included the concentration of blood glucose, HbA1c, C-peptide, hs-CRP, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL. RESULTS: The consumption of NFJ by 20 patients with DT2 resulted in a significant mean decrease of the morning blood sugar level monitored over a period of eight weeks. While NFJ reduced the blood glucose level in several but not all hyperglycemic patients, it did not cause hypoglycemia in normoglycemic patients. NFJ consumption also reduced the mean HbA1c value significantly (p= 0.033). Significant decreases (p= 0.01) were also achieved for high sensitive CRP values in patients starting with high levels (>2 mg/L), whereas no change was observed in patients with normal values (< 2 mg/L). The level of C-peptide showed a significant mean increase after four weeks of NFJ consumption in those patients who started with low levels (<3 μg/l, p=0.004, N=11) but not in patients with higher levels (> 3 μg/L). CONCLUSION: The daily consumption of NFJ has the potential to regulate elevated blood sugar levels and some other pathological parameters in patients with DT2. NFJ therefore serves as a suitable additive to the diet of diabetic patients."

The discovery of the therapeutic properties of active substances in plant extracts represents an interesting field of research into a more efficient treatment against leishmaniasis. Morinda citrifolia, commonly known as noni, has demonstrated promising results as antileishmanial and immunomodulator. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate activity against axenic amastigote and hydrogen peroxide induction capacity by M. citrifolia fruit juice. RESULTS: Phytochemical screening identified anthraquinones, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, steroids, saponins, coumarins, phenolic compounds, tannins, anthocyanidins and chalcones. Noni juice exhibited dose-dependent activity and an IC50 of 240.1 µg/mL for axenic amastigotes. An absence of endotoxins was observed at the concentrations analyzed, while no cytotoxic effects were identified. Noni juice induced hydrogen peroxide production in BALB/c peritoneal macrophages but not in macrophages infected with Leishmania amazonensis. M. citrifolia fruit juice exhibited antileishmanial activity against L. amazonensis axenic amastigotes and activated macrophages by hydrogen peroxide induction, asserting its potential for further research into new forms of leishmaniasis treatment.",

Plants have been the basis for medical treatments in human history and still widely practiced. Blackberry (Morus nigra) is one of the fruits rich in anthocyanin. The present study examined the effect of blackberry fruit juice on LID in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 42 male mice were used, which were divided into six groups equally: one control group and five groups receiving MPTP injection. After confirmation of Parkinsonism in MPTP groups, one group was preserved without treatment and four other groups were treated with levodopa (50 mg/kg ip). After the onset of LID (2 weeks), one group was kept without additional treatment and three other groups were treated with three different doses of blackberry fruit juice (5, 10, and 15 mL/kg) with levodopa orally for 7 days. Abnormal involuntary movement scale (AIMS) and cylinder behavioral test were carried out according to the schedule. The collected data were analyzed using the SPSS software with the significant level of P<0.05. RESULTS: Parkinson's disease was confirmed with AIMS test on the fourth day after MPTP injection. The onset of LID was observed after 2 weeks of levodopa treatment using both behavioral tests. The result of administration of M. nigra fruit juice for 1 week showed that this addition is useful in hindering LID. These effects were more pronounced at doses 10 and 15 mL/kg with nearly the same results on attenuating AIMS. Low dose of the fruit juice does not seem to affect LID significantly. CONCLUSION: M. nigra fruit juice is effective to attenuate LID in an MPTP-induced Parkinson mice model."

The medicinal properties of Morinda citrifolia L. have been widely exploited for the treatment of age-associated diseases. This study aims to investigate the in vitro and in vivo effects of noni (M. citrifolia) fruit juice (NFJ) on neuro-immunomodulation in the lymph node lymphocytes of F344 rats. METHODS: Lymphocytes isolated from axillary and inguinal lymph nodes of young (3-4 months) and old (18-21 months) rats were treated in vitro with different concentrations (0.0001%, 0.01%, and 1%) of NFJ for a period of 24 h. In the in vivo study, old (16-17 months) male F344 rats were treated with 5 mL/kg body weight of 5%, 10% and 20% of NFJ, twice a day, by oral gavage, and lymph node lymphocytes were isolated after 60 d. Concanavalin A (Con A)-induced lymphocyte proliferation, interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production and expression of intracellular markers, such as phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK1/2), phospho-cAMP response element-binding protein, phospho-protein kinase B (p-Akt), phospho-tyrosine hydroxylase (p-TH), phospho-nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor-α (p-IκB-α) and phospho-nuclear factor-κB (p-NF-κB p65 and p50) were examined in the lymphocytes of lymph nodes. RESULTS: NFJ increased Con A-induced lymphocyte proliferation, IL-2 and IFN-γ production, and p-ERK1/2 expression both in vitro and in vivo. In in vivo NFJ-treated old rats, lymph node lymphocytes showed increased expression of p-TH and Akt, nitric oxide production and decreased expression of p-NF-κB p65 and p50. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the immunostimulatory properties of NFJ are facilitated through intracellular signaling pathways involving ERK1/2, Akt and NF-κB.",

Covariates of interest included age, demographic factors, smoking, body mass index, hormone replacement therapy, lifestyle factors, change in whole fruit intake, and change in sugar-sweetened beverage intake. The mean weight change was 3.2 lbs. over 3 years. In multivariable adjusted analyses, each 1 serving/day increase in 100% fruit juice intake was associated with a 3-year weight gain of 0.39 lbs.

The purpose of the present study was to systematically review and quantitatively summarise results from randomised controlled trials (RCT) examining effects of 100 % fruit juice on glucose-insulin homeostasis. Eligible studies were identified from a systematic review of PubMed and EMBASE and hand searches of reference lists from reviews and relevant papers. Using data from eighteen RCT, meta-analyses evaluated the mean difference in fasting blood glucose (sixteen studies), fasting blood insulin (eleven studies), the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; seven studies) and glycosylated Hb (HbA1c; three studies) between the 100 % fruit juice intervention and control groups using a random-effects model. Compared with the control group, 100 % fruit juice had no significant effect on fasting blood glucose (-0·13 (95 % CI -0·28, 0·01) mmol/l; P = 0·07), fasting blood insulin (-0·24 (95 % CI -3·54, 3·05) pmol/l; P = 0·89), HOMA-IR (-0·22 (95 % CI -0·50, 0·06); P = 0·13) or HbA1c (-0·001 (95 % CI -0·38, 0·38) %; P = 0·28). Results from stratified analyses and univariate meta-regressions also largely showed no significant associations between 100 % fruit juice and the measures of glucose control. Overall, findings from this meta-analysis of RCT suggest a neutral effect of 100 % fruit juice on glycaemic control. These findings are consistent with findings from some observational studies suggesting that consumption of 100 % fruit juice is not associated with increased risk of diabetes."

Here, we assessed phytochemical compositions, antioxidant activity, and effects of total and filtered fruit and leafy stem juices of Momordica charantia on human T cell proliferation and differentiation through quantification of Th1/Th2 cytokines. In the absence of stimulation, total fruit and leafy stem juices induced significant T cell proliferation. Under PHA stimulation, both juices potentiated plant-induced T cell proliferation. However, the filtered fruit and leafy stem juices significantly inhibited PHA-stimulated T cell proliferation, while neither juice influenced T cell proliferation. Moreover, total and filtered fruit juice increased IL-4 secretion, while total and filtered leafy stem juice enhanced IFN-γ production. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of tannins, flavonoids, anthocyans, steroids, and triterpenoids in both juices. Alkaloids, quinone derivatives, cardenolides, and cyanogenic derivatives were undetectable. The saponins present in total juices were undetectable after filtration. Moreover, both juices had appreciable antioxidant capacity. Our study supports the type 1 antidiabetic effect of filtered fruit juice of M. charantia which may be related to its immunosuppressive and T-helper 2 cell inducing capacities. Due to their immune-stimulatory activities and their ability to increase T-helper 1 cell cytokines, total fruit and leafy stem juices may serve in the treatment of immunodeficiency and certain infections.",

      "abstract": "Hypercholesterolemia is an important risk factor linked to the alteration of blood hematology and clinical chemistry associated with the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Previous studies have demonstrated the safety and potential health benefits of Baccaurea angulata (BA) fruit. We hypothesized that the oral administration of BA fruit juice could ameliorate the alteration in the hematological and biochemical biomarkers of diet-induced hypercholesterolemic rabbits. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different doses of BA juice on the hematological and biochemical biomarkers in normo- and hypercholesterolemic rabbits. Thirty-five healthy adult New Zealand White rabbits were assigned to seven different groups for 90days of diet intervention. Four atherogenic groups were fed a 1% cholesterol diet and 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5mL of BA juice per kg of rabbit daily. The other three normal groups were fed a commercial rabbit pellet diet and 0, 0.5, and 1.0mL of BA juice per kg of rabbit daily. Baseline and final blood samples after 90days of repeated administration BA juice were analyzed for hematological parameters while serum, aortic and hepatic lysates were analyzed for lipid profiles and other biochemical biomarkers. The alteration of the hemopoietic system, physiological changes in serum and tissues lipid profiles and other biochemicals resulting from the consumption of a high-cholesterol diet were significantly (P<.05) ameliorated by the administration of BA juice. Improvements of the biomarkers in rabbits were dose-dependent, markedly enhanced at the highest dose of juice (1.5mL/kg/day). The results suggest potential health benefits of the antioxidant-rich BA fruit juice against hypercholesterolemia-associated hematological and biochemical alterations in the rabbit.",

      "abstract": "Biological macromolecules are primarily composed of complex polysaccharides that strengthen microbial growth for the production of industrially relevant enzymes. The presence of polysaccharides in the form of the disrupted cell wall and cell materials are among major challenges in the fruit juice industry. The breakdown of such biological macromolecules including cellulose and pectin is vital for the juices processing. In this background, pectinolytic enzymes including polygalacturonase (PG), pectin lyase (PL), and pectin methylesterase (PME) were isolated from Aspergillus ornatus, statistically optimized and purified via ammonium sulfate fractionation (ASF), dialysis, and Sephadex G-100 gel permeation chromatography. After passing through Sephadex G-100 column, PG, PL, and PME were 2.60-fold, 3.30-fold, and 4.52-fold purified with specific activities of 475.2U/mg, 557.1U/mg, and 205.7U/mg. The active PG, PL, and PME, each separately, were surface immobilized using various concentrations of chitosan and dextran polyaldehyde as a macromolecular crosslinking agent. Prior to exploit for juice clarification purposes, various parameters including pH, thermal and Michaelis-Menten kinetic constants of purified and chitosan-immobilized fractions were investigated. A considerable improvement in the pH and thermal profiles was recorded after immobilization. However, the negligible difference between the Km and Vmax values of purified free and chitosan-immobilized fractions revealed that the conformational flexibility of pectinolytics was retained as such. A significant color and turbidity reductions were recorded after 60min treatment with CTS-PG, followed by CTS-PME, and CTS-PL. It can be concluded that the clarification of apples, mango, peach, and apricot juices was greatly affected by CTS-PG, CTS-PME, and CTS-PL treatments rendering them as potential candidatures for food industry applications.",

After intervention, serum and tissues specimens were collected for biomarker and gene expression measurement. FV juice intervention increased total antioxidant capacity, glutathione, vitamin C, β-carotene, total polyphenols, flavonoids levels andglutathione peroxidaseenzyme activity in rat serum or tissues (p < 0.05). FV juice intervention caused reduction of malondialdehyde levels in rat liver (p < 0.05) and significantly modulated transcript levels of glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase l (NQO1)in rat liver and brain (p < 0.05).

In the current study, we investigated the effects of noni fruit juice (NFJ) in the treatment of C57BL/6 mice, which were continuously exposed to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 9 consecutive days. NFJ consumption had no impact on the reduction of the clinical signs of the disease or on weight loss. Nonetheless, when a dilution of 1 : 10 was used, the intestinal architecture of the mice was preserved, accompanied by a reduction in the inflammatory infiltrate. Regardless of the concentration of NFJ, a decrease in both the activity of myeloperoxidase and the key inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IFN-γ, was also observed in the intestine. Furthermore, when NFJ was diluted 1 : 10 and 1 : 100, a reduction in the production of nitric oxide and IL-17 was detected in gut homogenates. Overall, the treatment with NFJ was effective in different aspects associated with disease progression and worsening. These results may point to noni fruit as an important source of anti-inflammatory molecules with a great potential to inhibit the progression of inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease.",

(Noni), have been widely used in traditional medicine in South and Southeast Asia for several centuries. The therapeutic effects of the noni are believed to be mediated through several phytochemicals such as anthraquinones, iridoid, fatty acid glycosides, alcohols, etc. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of Morinda citrifolia fruit juice (noni fruit juice; NFJ) on neural-immune interactions through the involvement of intracellular signaling pathways both in vitro and in vivo in the splenic lymphocytes of young and old male F344 rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the in vitro study, splenocytes from young and old F344 rats were isolated and treated with 0.0001-1% concentrations of NFJ for a period of 24h, while in the in vivo study, old F344 rats were orally administered (5ml/kg body weight) with NFJ (5%, 10% and 20%) twice daily for 60 days. After the treatment period, concanavalin A (Con A)-induced lymphocyte proliferation, cytokines (IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-6, and TNF-α) production, expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (p-TH), nerve growth factor (NGF), m-TOR, IκB-α, p-NF-κB (p50 and p65), p-ERK, p-Akt, p-CREB and lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl formation, nitric oxide (NO) production were examined in the splenocytes. RESULTS: In vitro NFJ incubation of splenic lymphocytes increased Con A-induced lymphocyte proliferation, IL-2 and IFN-γ production, and expression of p-ERK, p-Akt, and p-CREB in young and old rats. In vivo treatment of old rats with NFJ increased lymphoproliferation, IL-2 and IFN-γ production, the expression of p-TH, NGF, and NO production, and suppressed IL-6 production, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl formation, and the expression of IκB-α and p-NF-κB (p50) in the splenocytes. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results suggest that Morinda citrifolia fruit juice enhanced neural-immune interactions and cell survival pathways while inhibiting inflammatory processes that may be useful in the treatment of age-associated diseases.",

OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the antidiabetic activities of Momordica charantia (bitter gourd) on streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wister rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups. Group I, Normal control; Group II, STZ diabetic; Group III and IV, Momordica charantia fruit juice was orally administered to diabetic rats (10 mL/kg/day either as prophylaxis for 14 days before induction of diabetes then 21 days treatment, or as treatment given for 21 days after induction of diabetes). The effects of MC juice were studied both in vivo and in vitro by studying the glucose uptake of isolated rat diaphragm muscles in the presence and absence of insulin. Histopathological examination of pancreas was also performed. RESULTS: This study showed that MC caused a significant reduction of serum glucose (135.99 ± 6.27 and 149.79 ± 1.90 vs. 253.40* ± 8.18) for prophylaxis and treatment respectively, fructosamine (0.99 ± 0.01 and 1.01 ± 0.04 vs. 3.04 ± 0.07), total cholesterol, triglycerides levels, insulin resistance index (1.13 ± 0.08 and 1.19 ± 0.05 vs. 1.48 ± 1.47) and pancreatic malondialdehyde content (p < 0.05). While it induced a significant increase of serum insulin (3.41 ± 0.08 and 3.28 ± 0.08 vs. 2.39 ± 0.27), HDL-cholesterol, total antioxidant capacity levels, β cell function percent, and pancreatic reduced glutathione (GSH) content (p < 0.05) and improved histopathological changes of the pancreas. It also increased glucose uptake by diaphragms of normal (12.17 ± 0.60 vs. 9.07 ± 0.66) and diabetic rats (8.37 ± 0.28 vs. 4.29 ± 0.51) in the absence and presence of insulin (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Momordica charantia presents excellent antidiabetic and antioxidant activities and thus has great potential as a new source for diabetes treatment whether it is used for prophylaxis or treatment.",

      "abstract": "An extracellular exo-polygalacturonase (exo-PG) from Penicillium notatum was immobilized in sodium-alginate matrix through two different protocols, viz. covalent bonding and adsorption to enhance its catalytic activity, thermal stability and life-time properties for industrial applications. Covalent immobilization was more efficient in terms of high relative activity (45.89%) and immobilization yield (71.6%) as compared to adsorption. Immobilized exo-PG derivatives displayed maximum activities at pH 5.5 and 55°C as compared to free enzyme which showed its optimum activity at pH 6.0 and 50°C. The affinity of enzyme towards its substrate (Km(app)) was reduced after immobilization and Vmax of covalently immobilized exo-PG decreased to 66.7% while the Vmax value of adsorbed enzyme increased up to 150% as compared to free counterpart. Both immobilization techniques greatly enhanced the thermal stability profile of the enzyme. At 60°C, immobilized exo-PGs retained more than 90% of their residual activities after 60min of heating, while free enzyme did not show any activity at the same temperature. Thermodynamic properties (i.e., Ea, ΔH*, ΔS*and ΔG*) of the free and immobilized enzymes were also investigated. Sodium-alginate covalently immobilized and adsorbed enzymes showed excellent recycling efficiencies and retained 50.0% and 41.0% of original activities, respectively after seven consecutive batch reactions. Moreover, the immobilized enzymes treatment achieved promising results in turbidity and viscosity reduction as well as clarity amelioration in various fruit juices. Altogether catalytic, thermo-stability and fruit juices clarification characteristics of the immobilized ex-PGs suggest a high potential for biotechnological exploitability.",

Noni fruit juice has recently become a very popular remedy for the treatment of several diseases, including psychiatric disorders. This study aimed to investigate the anticraving effect of Tahitian Noni® Juice (TNJ) against ethanol seeking behavior in ICR male mice using the conditioned place preference (CPP) test. The CPP procedure consisted of four phases: preconditioning, conditioning, extinction, and reinstatement. During conditioning, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of ethanol (2 g/kg body weight (bw)) and normal saline (10 ml/kg bw) were given on alternate days for 12 days. Then, the animals were subjected to extinction trials for the next 12 days to weaken CPP. Finally, CPP was reinstated in the extinguished animals by a single low-dose priming injection of ethanol (0.4 g/kg bw, i.p.). The effect of TNJ (as a source of drinking water) on different phases of ethanol CPP in mice was studied. TNJ-treated mice showed a significant reduction in ethanol seeking behavior in the CPP test. The reference drug, acamprosate (ACAM) also showed a similar effect in the CPP test. The outcome of this study suggests that TNJ is effective in attenuating ethanol craving in mice and could be utilized for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Further clinical studies in this direction are warranted to support the present preclinical findings.",

This paper provides an overview of the effect on these qualities by the use of alternatives to traditional thermal treatments in fruit-juice processing, for three key operations in fruit-juice production such as microbial inactivation, enzyme inactivation, and juice-yield improvement. These alternatives are UV light, high-intensity light pulses, γ-irradiation, pulsed electric fields, radiofrequency electric fields, Ohmic heating, microwave heating, ultrasound, high hydrostatic pressure, supercritical carbon dioxide, ozonation, and flash-vacuum expansion. Although alternatives to heat treatments seem to be less detrimental than the thermal treatment, there are many parameters and conditions that influence the output, as well as the nature of the juice itself, hampering comparisons between different studies. Additionally, future research should focus on understanding the mechanisms underlying the changes in the overall quality of fruit juices, and also on scaled-up processes, process design, and optimization that need to be deal with in detail to maximize their potential as alternative nonthermal technologies in fruit-juice processing while maintaining fruit-juice attributes to the maximum.",

As such, this fruit form has the potential to improve antioxidant status and mediate outcomes influenced by redox status. A systematic review of the literature published between 1995 and 2013 was conducted using PubMed database to evaluate associations between intake of 100% FJ and markers of antioxidant/oxidant status and blood lipid levels in healthy, free-living adults ≥18 years. Data extraction and analysis was conducted according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Evidence Analysis Process. Limited evidence from ten clinical trials meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria suggests potential improvements in a variety of antioxidant or oxidants biomarkers postconsumption of 100% FJ. Weak evidence from five studies suggests that one or more blood lipid measures may be positively influenced by consumption of 100% FJ. Heterogeneity in study methodology including biomarkers, 100% FJ type, dosage, and intervention duration precludes the ability to make evidence-based recommendations regarding a specific dose-duration-juice effect. Key characteristics in study designs were identified which must either be controlled or statistically adjusted for in future investigations in order to obtain a more accurate understanding of the complex relationship between metabolic outcomes and consumption of 100% FJ in context of a healthy dietary pattern.",

      "abstract": "Citrus junos Tanaka (yuzu) has a strong characteristic aroma, and hence, yuzu juice is used in a number of Japanese foods. We herein evaluated the functional compounds of yuzu juice to investigate whether underwater shockwave pretreatment affects its functionality. Employing the shockwave pretreatment at an increased discharge and energy of 3.5kV and 4.9kJ, respectively, resulted in an increase in the flavanone glycoside content and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). The ORAC value of yuzu juice cultivated in Rikuzentakata increased approximately 1.7 times upon underwater shockwave pretreatment. The treatment method proposed herein exhibited reliable and good performance for the extraction of functional and antioxidant chemicals in yuzu fruits, and was comparable with traditional squeezing methods. The high applicability and reliability of this technique for improving the antioxidant functionality of yuzu fruit juice was demonstrated, confirming the potential for application to a wide range of food extraction processes.",

Hence, breakdown of cellulose along with pectin and starch is important for the juice processing. In this context, magnetic tri-enzyme nanobiocatalyst was prepared by simultaneously co-immobilizing three enzymes; α-amylase, pectinase and cellulase onto amino-functionalized magnetic nanoparticle by 60mM glutaraldehyde concentration with 10h cross-linking time for one pot juice clarification. The prepared nanobiocatalyst was characterized by FT-IR, SEM and XRD. The thermal (50-70°C) and pH (3-6) stability studies indicated more than two folds increment in half-life and enhanced tolerance to lower pH. The immobilized enzymes retained up to 75% of residual activity even after eight consecutive cycles of reuse. Finally, the clarification of apple, grapes and pineapple juices using magnetic tri-enzyme showed 41%, 46% and 53% respective reduction in turbidity till 150min treatment.",

After extraction, juice samples were incubated with hydrochloric acid in order to achieve hydrolysis of naringin to naringenin. The hydrolysis parameters were optimized by using a half-fraction factorial central composite design (CCD). After sample preparation, chromatographic separation was obtained on a Chiralcel® OJ-RH column using the mobile phase consisting of 10mM aqueous ammonium acetate:methanol:acetonitrile (50:30:20; v/v/v) with detection at 288nm. The average recovery of the analyzed compounds ranged from 85.6 to 97.1%. The proposed method was satisfactorily used for the determination of naringenin enantiomers in various fruit juices samples.",

Results showed that the cactus juice exhibited desirable technological characteristics. Besides, it also contained a high amount of phenolic compounds being the major contributors to the overall antioxidant activity of juice. HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS(n) measurements in the fruits' peel and pulp showed that isorhamnetin 3-O-rutinoside was determined as the single flavonol found only in the fruit's peel. Treating fruit mash with a moderate electric field strength increased juice yield and improved juice characteristics. Promisingly, the highest release of isorhamnetin 3-O-rutinoside from fruit's peel into juice was maximally achieved by PEF.",

(commonly known as Noni) has been explored in ancient folk remedies with a wide range of therapeutic utility, including antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antitumour, analgesic, hypotensive, anti-inflammatory and immune enhancing effects. AIM: The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of Noni fruit juice on serum lipid profile in high fat diet induced murine model of dyslipidemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hyperlipidemia was induced by feeding a cholesterol rich high fat diet for 45 days in wistar albino rats of either sex (n=8). Noni fruit juice administered at 50mg/kg/day and 100mg/kg/day, per oral, was compared with the standard drug Atorvastatin (10mg/kg/day, oral) fed for the latter 30 days. The blood samples were then sent for complete blood lipid profile, after 30 days of treatment. The data presented as mean ± SEM was analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test. The p <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: The Noni fruit juice treated group showed a significant decrease in the total cholesterol, triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein - Cholesterol at both the doses when compared to the disease control (p<0.05). However, the decrease in the TC (102.75±9.79 mg/dL) and LDL-C (47.87±7.47 mg/dL) levels observed with the noni fruit juice at the 50mg/kg dose employed, failed to show a statistical significance when compared to atorvastatin. CONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence for the hypolipidemic activity of Noni fruit juice in high fat diet induced hyperlipidemia in rats."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pomegranate fruit has been shown to exhibit the inhibitory activity against prostate cancer and lung cancer in vitro and in vivo, which might be a resource for chemoprevention and chemotherapy of cancer. Our previous documented findings indicated that treatment of urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma cell with the ethanol extract isolated from the juice of pomegranate fruit grown in Taiwan could inhibit tumor cell. In this study we intended to uncover the molecular pathway underlying anti-cancer efficacy of Taiwan pomegranate fruit juice against urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma. METHODS: We exploited two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to find the de-regulated proteins. Western immunoblotting was used to confirm the results collected from proteomics study. RESULTS: Comparative proteomics indicated that 20 proteins were differentially expressed in ethanol extract-treated T24 cells with 19 up-regulated and 1 down-regulated proteins. These de-regulated proteins were involved in apoptosis, cytoskeleton regulation, cell proliferation, proteasome activity and aerobic glycolysis. Further studies on signaling pathway demonstrated that ethanol extract treatment might inhibit urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma cell proliferation through restriction of PTEN/AKT/mTORC1 pathway via profilin 1 up-regulation. It also might evoke cell apoptosis through Diablo over-expression. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide a global picture to further investigate the anticancer molecular mechanism of pomegranate fruit.",

One of them is Citron syrup (Sharbat-e-Balang) containing edible Citrus medica L. fruit juice and sugar. The present study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of Citron syrup on patients with migraine headache. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Citron syrup was prepared as described in Qarabadin-e-kabir. In this double blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, ninety patients with migraine headache were allocated to three parallel groups (Citron syrup, propranolol or placebo). Patients received 15ml of Citron syrup, placebo syrup or 20mg of propranolol tablet three times daily after a meal for 4 weeks. Primary outcomes were obtained from three measures: the frequency (per month), mean duration (hour) and mean intensity (visual analogue scale \"VAS\" 0-10 score) of headache attacks evaluated prior to and following 4 weeks of the intervention. RESULTS: Citron syrup was superior to placebo in reduction of headache attacks intensity (P<0.01) and duration (p<0.0001) and as effective as propranolol in patients with migraine headache (P>0.05). However, unlike propranolol, Citron syrup could not significantly reduce the frequency of attacks compared to placebo. No indication of any serious side effects from Citron syrup was observed. CONCLUSION: According to obtained results, Citron syrup as a traditional Persian remedy can be suggested as an effective treatment for decreasing pain intensity and duration of attacks in migraine headache and the effectiveness is comparable to propranolol. However, the syrup did not show significant effect on frequency of attacks.",

      "abstract": "The biological activity of carotenoids depends on their bioaccessibility and solubilization in the gastrointestinal tract. These compounds are poorly dispersed in the aqueous media of the digestive tract due to their lipophilic nature. Thus, it is important to analyze the extent to which some factors, such as the food matrix and food processing, may improve their bioaccessibility. Beverages formulated with a blend of fruit juices and water (WB), milk (MB) or soymilk (SB) were treated by high-intensity pulsed electric fields (HIPEF) (35 kV cm(-1) with 4 μs bipolar pulses at 200 Hz for 1800 μs), high-pressure processing (HPP) (400 MPa at 40 °C for 5 min) or thermal treatment (TT) (90 °C for 1 min) in order to evaluate the influence of food matrix and processing on the bioaccessibility of carotenoids and on the lipophilic antioxidant activity (LAA). The bioaccessibility of these compounds diminished after applying any treatment (HIPEF, HPP and TT), with the exception of cis-violaxanthin + neoxanthin, which increased by 79% in HIPEF and HPP beverages. The lowest carotenoid bioaccessibility was always obtained in TT beverages (losses up to 63%). MB was the best food matrix for improving the bioaccessibility of carotenoids, as well as the LAA. The results demonstrate that treatment and food matrix modulated the bioaccessibility of carotenoids as well as the lipophilic antioxidant potential of beverages. Additionally, HIPEF and HPP could be considered as promising technologies to obtain highly nutritional and functional beverages.",

The changes in polyphenols composition were monitored using High Performance Liquid Chromatography Diode Array Detection and Folin Ciocalteu's method. Clarification treatment of pummelo fruit juice with a commercial pectinase was optimized based on incubation temperature, time and enzyme concentration. Both varieties of pummelo fruit juice were treated with different optimized variables which produced the highest clarities with the least effect to the juice physical quality. Tambun variety was found to have significantly more total phenolic compounds (p <0.05) in comparison to Ledang variety, possibly due to the amount of naringin. Three types of hydroxycinnamic acids (chlorogenic, caffeic and coumaric acid) and three compounds of flavanones (naringin, hesperidin and narirutin) were found in both fruit juices, where naringin and chlorogenic acid were the major contributor to the total phenolic content. Naringin, which gave out bitter aftertaste to the juice, was found to decrease, 1.6 and 0.59 % reduction in Ledang and Tambun respectively, post-enzymatic treatment. The decrease in naringin, albeit nominal, could be a potential benefit to the juice production in reducing the bitterness of the juice. Post-enzymatic analysis furthermore resulted in no significance differences (p <0.05) on the total phenolic compounds of both varieties. This study in summary provides a compositional database for Malaysian pummelo fruit juice of various phenolic compounds, which can provide useful information for evaluating the authenticity and the health benefits from the juice."

Pasteurization (63°C/30 min) and pH adjustment (pH 3.7 or pH 6.8) had either non-significant or slight effects on FJMB's antioxidant capacity, while sterilization significantly (p<0.05) increased or decreased its ABTS and FRAP depending on the different models. In vitro digestion of WP in FJMB was obviously (p < 0.05) inhibited by phenolics to varying degrees, and little influenced (p>0.05) by pasteurization, whereas sterilization initially accelerated WP digestion but did not change its overall digestibility.",

Twenty-five individuals completed the study. The study was a placebo-controlled crossover study, where every individual consumed 1 of the 4 treatments in turn. Each treatment phase was 4-week long and was followed by a 2-week washout period. The trial beverages were 350 g taken in 2 doses every day (ie, 175 mL taken twice daily). The hypothesis for the study was that the combination of polyphenols and fiber would have a greater benefit on gut health than the placebo product or the fiber or polyphenols on their own. There were no differences in fecal levels of total bacteria, Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas group, Bifidobacteriumspecies, Clostridium perfringens, or Lactobacillus species among any of the treatment groups. Fecal short chain fatty acid concentrations did not vary among treatment groups, although prostaglandin E2 concentrations were higher after consumption of the Boysenberry juice beverage. No significant differences were found in quantitative measures of gut health between the Boysenberry juice beverage, the apple fiber beverage, the Boysenberry juice plus apple fiber beverage, and the placebo beverage.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The juice was administered orally for 7, 14, 21 and 30 days at doses of 2.5 ml/kg, 5 ml/kg and 10 ml/kg. Memory was assessed in the one-way passive avoidance task (step through) which consisted of one training session and two retention tests (3 hours and 24 hours after training). The variables measured were the latency time to step into the dark compartment of the apparatus and the learning criterion (remaining in the illuminated compartment for at least 180 sec). RESULTS: Oral administration of Aronia melanocarpa fruit juice for 7 and 14 days resulted in a dose-dependent tendency to increase the latency time and the learning criterion compared to saline-treated controls but the effect failed to reach statistical significance. After 21 days of treatment, the juice dose-dependently prolonged the latency time at the retention tests, the effect being significant at doses of 5 ml/kg and 10 ml/kg. Applied for 30 days, the juice in all the tested doses increased significantly the latency time at the retention tests and the dose of 10 ml/kg significantly increased the percentage of rats reaching the learning criterion. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that Aronia melanocarpa fruit juice could improve memory in rats. The effect is probably due to the polyphenolic ingredients of the juice which have been shown to be involved in learning and memory processes.",

PFJ and EA have been reported to suppress various cancers, including prostate cancer. However, their chemopreventive effects on development and progression of prostate cancer using in vivo models have not been established yet. METHODS: The transgenic rat for adenocarcinoma of prostate (TRAP) model was used to investigate the modulating effects of PFJ and EA on prostate carcinogenesis. Three-week-old male transgenic rats were treated with EA or PFJ for 10 weeks. In vitro assays for cell growth, apoptosis, and Western blot were performed using the human prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP (androgen-dependent), PC-3 and DU145 (androgen-independent). RESULTS: PFJ decreased the incidence of adenocarcinoma in lateral prostate, and both EA and PFJ suppressed the progression of prostate carcinogenesis and induced apoptosis by caspase 3 activation in the TRAP model. In addition, the level of lipid peroxidation in ventral prostate was significantly decreased by EA treatment. EA was able to inhibit cell proliferation of LNCaP, whereas this effect was not observed in PC-3 and DU145. As with the in vivo data, EA induced apoptosis in LNCaP by increasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase 3 activation. Cell-cycle related proteins, p21(WAF) , p27(Kip) , cdk2, and cyclin E, were increased while cyclin D1 and cdk1 were decreased by EA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that PFJ and EA are potential chemopreventive agents for prostate cancer, and EA may be the active component of PFJ that exerts these anti-cancer effects.",

A total of eight semi-continuously-fed single and co-digesters were operated side-by-side at sludge retention times (SRT) of 20 and 10 days. Co-digestion of industrial waste streams (TWAS and SC) with MC and LL resulted in increased operational stability compared to the single digestion of industrial TWAS at the higher organic loading (10 d SRT). Although digester operational temperature had no statistically significant effect on organics removal and biogas production, mesophilic digesters had consistently higher total coliform densities (8838-37,959 most probable number or MPN/g-dry weight) compared to the thermophilic digesters (41-6723 MPN/g-dry weight) at both SRTs. Coliform analysis results also proved that most of the thermophilic digestates could be classified as Class A biosolids according to regulations. Furthermore, addition of industrial TWAS to co-digesters enhanced the dewaterability of the digested streams. A cost-benefit analysis confirmed the benefits and indicated that a full-scale co-digester utilizing all four waste streams can decrease the total capital and operational cost by 22% ($10.52 million).",

The fruit juice was analyzed by the high-performance liquid chromatography method, and quercetin, ellagic acid, catechin, rutin, eriodictyol, gallic acid, pyrocatechol, syringic acid, and eriocitrin were identified. The results showed a significant anti-inflammatory activity of F. sellowiana fruit juice, sustained also by an effective antioxidant activity observed in preliminary studies on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) test. In particular, the anti-inflammatory activity edema inhibition is significant since the first hour (44.11%) and persists until the fifth hour (44.12%) of the treatment. The effect on superoxide anion release was studied in human whole blood, in the presence of activators affecting neutrophils by different mechanisms. The juice showed an inhibiting response on neutrophils basal activity in all experimental conditions. In stimulated neutrophils, the higher inhibition of superoxide anion generation was observed at concentration of 10(-4) and 10(-2) mg/mL in whole blood stimulate with phorbol-myristate-13-acetate (PMA; 20% and 40%) and with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP; 15% and 48%). The significant reduction of edema and the inhibition of O2(-) production, occurring mainly through interaction with protein-kinase C pathway, confirm the anti-inflammatory effect of F. sellowiana fruit juice.",

(Annonaceae) (AM) fruit juice is widely consumed either raw or after processing in tropical countries because of its very juicy, creamy and sweet character including its medicinal importance. The safety of AM fruit was investigated in Sprague-Dawley rats for acute and 60-day subchronic toxicity effects. Methods: Rats were administered distilled water (DW) and AM daily at doses of 80, 400 and 2000 mg/kg orally for 60 days. At the end of the study, blood samples were assayed for biochemical and hematological parameters. Vital organs were harvested and assessed for antioxidants and histopathology. Results: There was no mortality recorded up to 2000 mg/kg following acute administration. There were no significant changes in vital organ weights and hematological and biochemical parameters. However, significant (p<0.05) reduction in platelet count and packed cell volume was observed at 2000 and 400 mg/kg, respectively, which was reversed after cessation of treatment. Interestingly, subchronic oral administration of AM (80, 400 or 2000 mg/kg) significantly (p<0.001) increased sperm count and motility in comparison to vehicle-treated control. AM long-term treatment induced significant (p<0.05, <0.01 and <0.001) increases in the levels of glutathione, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase, respectively, in the liver and kidney. Conversely, AM (2000 mg/kg) produced significant (p<0.001) increase in malondialdehyde level with decreased (p<0.05) SOD activity in the brain. Conclusions: The study established that AM did not induce any significant toxic effect, indicating that it is safe in rats following oral administration for 60 consecutive days."

Development of nanoemulsion was optimized for process parameters such as surfactant type, surfactant concentration and emulsification time to obtain lower droplet diameter with greater stability. Increase in surfactant concentration and emulsiﬁcation time resulted in nanoemulsion with minimized droplet diameter. Tween80 was more effective in reducing droplet size when compared to that of Tween20. Selected formulation with optimized process parameter (with oil-surfactant mixing ratio of 1:3 v/v and Tween80 as surfactant) was used for delivery of eugenol. Eugenol-loaded nanoemulsion was formulated with droplet diameter of 13 nm and was stable for more than 1 month. Sesame oil blended eugenol-loaded nanoemulsion demonstrated lower droplet size and higher stability than only-eugenol (without sesame oil) nanoemulsion. Eugenol-loaded nanoemulsion S3E3 exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Inactivation kinetics of S. aureus showed time and concentration killing of bacteria upon treatment with S3E3 nanoemulsion. Fluorescence microscopy results demonstrated that S3E3 nanoemulsion treatment resulted in alteration of membrane permeability. In situ assessment of S3E3 in orange juice exhibited a significant reduction in the native bacteria population.",

The in vitro antioxidant and antiproliferative activity against mouse melanoma B16 cells of patatin were investigated. The results showed that the monosaccharide composition of patatin included rhamnose, mannose, glucose, and galactose with a molar ratio of 41 : 30 : 21 : 8, and patatin consisted of (1 → 3) linked α-mannose, (1 → 4) linked α-galactose, (1 → 4) linked β-glucose, and (1 → 2) linked α-rhamnose. Furthermore, patatin possessed significant antioxidant activities measured by scavenging of the DPPH and superoxide free radicals, notable reducing power, protective effects against hydroxyl radical-induced oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation inhibitory. Moreover, patatin was identified as a potent antiproliferative agent against mouse melanoma B16 cells, causing cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Assays of apoptotic cells also showed that patatin treatment at concentrations of 20 mg mL(-1) resulted in a marked reduction of viable cells. These results obtained in in vitro models suggested that patatin may have potential application as a cancer chemopreventive agent and food ingredient.",

We have observed a reduction in genotoxic effects of MMC and DXR caused by the juice. TNJ provoked a marked decrease in all kinds of MMC- and DXR-induced mutant spots, mainly due to its antirecombinagenic activity.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To our knowledge, no data have yet shown the combined effects of GSTM1/GSTT1 gene polymorphisms with high consumption of a fruit and vegetable diet on the body's antioxidant capacity. A 2-wk dietary intervention in healthy participants was conducted to test the hypothesis that the antioxidant biomarkers in individuals with different glutathione-S-transferases (GST) genotypes will be different in response to a high fruit-juice and vegetable diet. METHODS: In our study, 24 healthy volunteers with different GST genotypes (12 GSTM1+/GSTT1+ and 12 GSTM1-/GSTT1- participants) consumed a controlled diet high in fruit-juice and vegetables for 2 wk. Blood and first-void urine specimens were obtained at baseline, 1-wk, and 2-wk intervals. The antioxidant capacity-related biomarkers in blood and urine were observed and recorded at the scheduled times. RESULTS: Erythrocyte GST and glutathione reductase (GR) activities response to a high fruit-juice and vegetable diet are GST genotype-dependent. Two weeks on the high fruit-juice and vegetable diet increased GST and GR activities in the GSTM1+/GSTT1+ group (P < 0.05 compared with baseline or GSTM1-/GSTT1- group), although no effects were observed on GST and GR activities in GSTM1-/GSTT1- participants. Dietary intervention increased total antioxidant capacity and decreased plasma malondialdehyde content in all participants (P < 0.05 compared with baseline), whereas GSTM1+/GSTT1+ participants respond more quickly to a high fruit-juice and vegetable diet than GSTM1-/GSTT1- participants. The diet intervention was effective in enhancing glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities in all participants (P < 0.05 compared with baseline), although there was no influence on erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The effects of a diet rich in fruit-juice and vegetables on antioxidant capacity were dependent on GSTM1/GSTT1 genotypes.",

The present study validates self-reported fruit, juice and vegetable (FJV) intakes in 8- to 11-year-old children by comparing intake with plasma carotenoid concentration, and by comparing the reported FJV intake to actually eaten FJV, as observed by a photographic method. A total of eighty-one children, assisted by parents, reported their diet for seven consecutive days. For the same five schooldays as they reported their diet, the children's school lunch was photographed and weighed before and after eating. In the week after the diet reporting, fasting blood samples were taken. Self-reported intake of FJV and estimated intake of carotenoids were compared with plasma carotenoid concentration. Accuracy of self-reported food and FJV consumption at school lunch was measured in terms of matches, intrusion, omission and faults, when compared with images and weights of lunch intake. Self-reported intake of FJV was significantly correlated with the total carotenoid concentration (0·58) (P< 0·01). Fruit and juice consumption showed higher correlations than vegetables with plasma carotenoid concentration (0·38 and 0·42 v. 0·33) (P< 0·01). A total of 82 % of the participants fell into the same or adjacent quartiles when cross-classified by FJV intake and carotenoids biomarkers. WebDASC attained 82 % reporting matches overall and a higher percentage match for reporting fruits compared with beverages. The present study indicated that WebDASC can be used to rank 8- to 11-year-old Danish children according to their intake of FJV overall and at school meals.",

      "abstract": "Concentrated fruit juice industries use a wide volume of water for washing and fruit processing, generating a large volume of wastewater. This work studied the combination of an aerobic biological process with a chemical coagulation/flocculation step to treat a high concentrated fruit juice wastewater. This wastewater presents a good biodegradability (BOD(5)/COD = 0.66) allowing a chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal above 90% in most reactors. The best results in aerobic biological treatment were obtained in reactors initially loaded with 2 g VSS L(-1) of biomass concentration and 20 g COD L(-1) of organic matter concentration. Three different kinetic models were evaluated (Monod, Haldane and Contois). The Haldane-inhibition model was the one that best fitted the COD biodegradation. AQUASIM software allowed calculate the following kinetic constants ranges for aerobic biodegradation: K (s): 6-20 g COD L(-1); v (max): 2.0-5.1 g COD g(-1) VSS day(-1) and K (i) values: 0.10-0.50 g COD L(-1). These constants corresponds to maximum removal rates (v*) between 0.11 and 0.26 g COD g(-1) VSS day(-1) for substrate concentrations (S*) from 0.77 to 3.16 g COD L(-1). A tertiary coagulation/flocculation process improved the efficiency of the biological pre-treatment. Ferric chloride was selected as best compromise to treat this wastewater. Optimal conditions were 0.44 g L(-1) of coagulant at pH = 5.5, achieving 94.4% and 99.6% on turbidity and COD removal, respectively.",

      "abstract": "This study has been carried out to assess the performance of a combined system consisting of an anaerobic hybrid (AH) reactor followed by a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) for treatment of fruit-juice industry wastewater at a temperature of 26 degrees C. Three experimental runs were conducted in this investigation. In the first experiment, a single-stage AH reactor was operated at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 10.2 h and organic loading rate (OLR) of 11.8 kg COD m(-3) d(-1). The reactor achieved a removal efficiency of 42% for chemical oxygen demand (COD), 50.8% for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), 50.3% for volatile fatty acids (VFA) and 56.4% for total suspended solids (TSS). In the second experiment, two AH reactors connected in series achieved a higher removal efficiency for COD (67.4%), BOD5 (77%), and TSS (71.5%) at a total HRT of 20 h and an OLR of 5.9 kg COD m(-3) d(-1). For removal of the remaining portions of COD, BOD5 and TSS from the effluent of the two-stage AH system, a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was investigated as a post-treatment unit. The reactor achieved a substantial reduction in total COD, resulting in an average effluent concentration of 50 mg L(-1) at an HRT of 11 h and OLR of 5.3 kg COD m(-3) d(-1). Almost complete removal of total BOD5 and oil and grease was achieved, i.e. 10 mg L(-1) and 1.2 mg L(-1), respectively, remained in the final effluent of the SBR.",

However, though diet represents a key factor in the modulation of inflammatory processes, evidence is not currently available on the nutritional regulation of IL-17 in humans. In a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, crossover study, we investigated the effect of High Fat Meal (HFM) on IL-17 circulating levels in presence of a placebo (HFM-P) or with a Fruit Juice Drink (HFM-FJD) composed of pineapple, blackcurrant and plum in fourteen healthy overweight humans. Fasting in the morning subjects ingested a test meal providing 1344 Kcal. Ingestion of HFM-P induced an inflammatory response mediated by TNF-α (p < 0.001), IL-6 (p < 0.001) and IL-17 (p < 0.01). Plasma IL-17 concentration significantly increased at 1 h (+2.6 ± 1.1 pg/ml), remaining high at 4 h (+2.98 ± 1.2 pg/ml), 6 h (+2.38 ± 0.6 pg/ml) and 8 h (+2.8 ± 0.9 pg/ml) (ANOVA for time-course p=0.009). When the HFM was consumed in the presence of the FJD a marked inhibition of IL-17 response to the HFM was observed (ANOVA between treatment p=0.037). We provided, for the first time, evidence on the role of diet in modulating IL-17 production in healthy overweight subjects.",

      "abstract": "High exposure of manganese is suggested to be a risk factor for many lung diseases. Evidence suggests anticancerous and antiangiogenic effects by products derived from Morinda citrifolia (noni) fruit. In this study, we investigated the effect of noni fruit juice (NFJ) on the expression of HIF-1α, a tumor angiogenic transcription factor in manganese-chloride (manganese)-stimulated A549 human lung carcinoma cells. Treatment with manganese largely induced expression of HIF-1α protein but did not affect HIF-1α mRNA expression in A549 cells, suggesting the metal-mediated co- and/or post-translational HIF-1α upregulation. Manganese treatment also led to increased phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated protein kinase-1/2 (ERK-1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 (JNK-1), protein kinase B (PKB), S6 and eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2α (eIF-2α) in A549 cells. Of note, the exposure of NFJ inhibited the manganese-induced HIF-1α protein upregulation in a concentration-dependent manner. Importantly, as assessed by results of pharmacological inhibition and siRNA transfection studies, the effect of NFJ on HIF-1α protein downregulation seemed to be largely associated with the ability of NFJ to interfere with the metal's signaling to activate PKB, ERK-1/2, JNK-1 and S6 in A549 cells. It was further shown that NFJ could repress the induction of HIF-1α protein by desferoxamine or interleukin-1β (IL-1β), another HIF-1α inducer in A549 cells. Thus, the present study provides the first evidence that NFJ has the ability to strongly downregulate manganese-induced HIF-1α protein expression in A549 human lung cancer cells, which may suggest the NFJ-mediated beneficial effects on lung pathologies in which manganese and HIF-1α overexpression play pathogenic roles.",

Coumaric acid, narirutin and hesperidin were the most abundant phenolic compounds in the FJ-SM beverage, while the main carotenoids were lutein, zeaxanthin and β-carotene. Immediately after HIPEF or heat processing, hesperidin content of the beverage showed a huge rise, resulting in a significant increase on the total phenolic concentration. Regarding carotenoid concentration, HIPEF or thermal treatment lead to a significant decrease; lutein, zeaxanthin and β-cryptoxanthin being the most affected compounds. In contrast, the content of some individual phenolics and carotenoids increased with time, while others tended to decrease or remained with no significant changes with regards to their initial values. Total phenolic concentration seemed to be highly stable during storage; while, total carotenoid content gradually diminished, irrespectively of the treatment applied. Overall, the changes observed in HIPEF treated FJ-SM beverage were less than those in the heat processed one. Hence, HIPEF is a feasible technology to obtain FJ-SM beverages with extended shelf-life and a similar profile of antioxidant compounds to freshly made beverages."

High vitamin C retention was observed in HIPEF and thermally treated beverages, but a significant depletion of the vitamin during storage occurred, which was correlated with antioxidant capacity. HIPEF treatment did not affect the concentration of group B vitamins, which also remained constant over time, but thermally treated beverages showed lower riboflavin (vitamin B2) concentration. With regard to enzyme activity, thermal processing was more effective than HIPEF on POD and LOX inactivation. The color of the beverages was maintained after HIPEF processing and during storage.

      "abstract": "In this work, a simple, practical and environmentally friendly sample pre-treatment method, ultrasound-assisted surfactant-enhanced emulsification microextraction coupled with high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector/electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry, was developed to determine diethofencarb and pyrimethanil residues in water and fruit juice samples. Tween 80 was used as an emulsifier and carbon tetrachloride was chosen as the extraction solvent, and no dispersive organic solvent was needed, which is typically required in common dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction methods. Several variables, such as the type and volume of extraction solvent and surfactant, extraction temperature and ultrasound extraction time were investigated and optimised. Under optimal conditions, the enrichment factors were 265 and 253 for diethofencarb and pyrimethanil, respectively. The limits of detection (LODs), calculated as three times the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), were 0.01 μg L(-1) for both diethofencarb and pyrimethanil. The linearity of the method was obtained in the range of 0.05-2000 μg L(-1), with correlation coefficients of 0.9994-0.9998. The water (at fortified levels of 0.1 and 1.0 μg L(-1)) and fruit juice samples (at fortified levels of 0.1 and 1.0 μg L(-1)) were successfully analysed using the proposed method, and the relative recoveries were in the range of 88-114%, 93-111%, 86-117% and 94-101%, respectively.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The health effects of added sugars have received much attention, but few studies have examined the association between foods that naturally contain sugar, such as 100% fruit juice, and risk of obesity and related conditions. Therefore, our purpose was to study the association between 100% fruit juice intake and risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome in a representative sample of the U.S. population. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of a multiethnic sample of U.S. adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004 was undertaken to examine the association between 100% fruit juice consumption and the odds of obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m2) and metabolic syndrome (Adult Treatment Panel [ATP] III definition). We used logistic regression analysis to estimate the odds of obesity and metabolic syndrome per category of fruit juice consumption exposure, while adjusting for covariates that may be confounders of this association. RESULTS: Of 14,196 adults included in the sample, 3961 were consumers of fruit juice. Consumers of 100% fruit juice, relative to nonconsumers, had lower mean BMI, lower waist circumference, and lower homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) insulin resistance (p < 0.001). Level of intake (oz/d) had a linear inverse association with HOMA (p < 0.001), whereas the association with BMI and waist circumference was U-shaped (p < 0.001). Consumers relative to nonconsumers had 22% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 13%-30%) lower odds of obesity and 15% (95% CI = 10%-28%) lower odds of metabolic syndrome. After adjustment for demographics and lifestyle factors, the lower odds of obesity remained statistically significant, but a statistically significant reduction in odds of metabolic syndrome was no longer noted. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with nonconsumers, those who consumed 100% fruit juice were leaner, were more insulin sensitive, and had lower odds of obesity and metabolic syndrome. The association with metabolic syndrome was explained primarily by other lifestyle factors, while the association with obesity remained independent. Experimental studies are needed to determine whether any direct physiologic link exists between consumption of 100% fruit juice and lower risks for obesity and metabolic syndrome.",
