      "abstract": "The prevalence of testicular dysfunction is increasing as it is a common diabetes mellites (DM) complication. The objective of this study is to explore the potential protective effect of sulbutiamine against testicular hypofunction associated with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DM in rats. Sulbutiamine was administered orally (60 mg/kg) to male Wistar rats for 8 weeks starting 72 h after a single injection of STZ (45 mg/kg, i.p.). Blood glucose level (BGL), serum testosterone level, sperm number, and motility were determined. Testicular tissue was examined histopathologically, and the Johnson score was evaluated. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), protein kinase C (PKC), nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were measured. Apoptosis was evaluated by immunohistochemical determination of B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 associated X-protein (Bax), and caspase-3. Sulbutiamine administration managed to reduce BGL and boost testicular function as manifested by increased testicular weight, testosterone level, sperm number, and motility compared to the STZ group. Additionally, histopathological examination revealed an improved histological picture and Johnson score of testicular tissue after sulbutiamine treatment. Sulbutiamine administration reduced testicular PKC, MDA, and PCNA levels and increased Nrf2 compared to the untreated group. Moreover, sulbutiamine treatment suppressed apoptosis triggered by STZ as evidenced by elevated Bcl-2, decreased Bax and reduced caspase-3. The present work revealed for the first time a promising protective role of sulbutiamine against STZ-induced testicular dysfunction which may add to the clinical utility of sulbutiamine. The underlying mechanisms involve reducing BGL and PKC, activating Nrf2 and inhibiting apoptosis.",

      "abstract": "One of the serious complications of diabetes mellitus is diabetic nephropathy (DN) which may finally lead to renal failure. The current study aimed to explore the effect of sulbutiamine, a synthetic derivative of vitamin B1, in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DN and related pathways. Experimental DN was successfully induced 8 weeks after a single low dose of STZ (45 mg/kg, I.P.). Four groups of rats were used in this study and divided randomly into: control group, diabetic group, sulbutiamine control (control + sulbutiamine) group, and sulbutiamine-treated (60 mg/kg) (diabetic + sulbutiamine) group. The fasting blood glucose level (BGL), the levels of kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1), urea and creatinine in serum, as well as the renal content of malondialdehyde (MDA), protein kinase C (PKC), toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) were determined. Additionally, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) contents were evaluated immunohistochemically. Sulbutiamine treatment decreased fasting BGL and improved the kidney function tests compared to diabetic rats. Moreover, TLR-4, NF-κB, MDA and PKC contents were substantially reduced following sulbutiamine treatment compared to the diabetic group. Sulbutiamine managed to obstruct the production of the pro-inflammatory TNF-α and IL-1β and suppressed TGF-β1 level, in addition to attenuating the histopathological changes associated with DN. This study revealed, for the first time, the ability of sulbutiamine to ameliorate STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy in rats. This nephroprotective outcome of sulbutiamine against DN may be attributed to glycemic control in addition to its anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects.",

      "abstract": "Sulbutiamine is a thiamine derivative developed in Japan in the mid-60's as a beriberi treatment drug. Since then, different potential applications have been described. For instance, there is some evidence that sulbutiamine can have anti-fatigue, nootropic, and antioxidant effects, which led to its use as a sport supplement (although some authors argue it is actually a masking doping strategy). Moreover, this molecule has been proposed as a possible treatment for some microsporidial infections and even for certain types of cancer. Despite these potential effects, sulbutiamine is still a relatively unknown molecule, which justifies the present review, where we discuss its history and the existing literature on its health applications. We conclude that there is a great potential for sulbutiamine use, well beyond its first described function (to increase thiamine tissue concentration). Indeed, new mechanisms of action have been found, mainly associated with its derivatives. Nevertheless, and although the research on sulbutiamine started 50 years ago, only a limited number of studies were conducted during this time frame. As so, methodological concerns need to be addressed and new studies are necessary, especially randomized controlled trials. Only then will the full potential of this versatile molecule be identified."

      "abstract": "Malignant cells frequently demonstrate an oncogenic-driven reliance on glycolytic metabolism to support their highly proliferative nature. Overexpression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) may promote this unique metabolic signature of tumor cells by inhibiting mitochondrial function. PDKs function to phosphorylate and inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. Silencing of PDK expression has previously been shown to restore mitochondrial function and reduce tumor cell proliferation. High dose Vitamin B1, or thiamine, possesses antitumor properties related to its capacity to reduce PDH phosphorylation and promote its enzymatic activity, presumably through PDK inhibition. Though a promising nutraceutical approach for cancer therapy, thiamine's low bioavailability may limit clinical effectiveness. Here, we have demonstrated exploiting the commercially available lipophilic thiamine analogs sulbutiamine and benfotiamine increases thiamine's anti-cancer effect in vitro. Determined by crystal violet proliferation assays, both sulbutiamine and benfotiamine reduced thiamine's millimolar IC50 value to micromolar equivalents. HPLC analysis revealed that sulbutiamine and benfotiamine significantly increased intracellular thiamine and TPP concentrations in vitro, corresponding with reduced levels of PDH phosphorylation. Through an ex vitro kinase screen, thiamine's activated cofactor form thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) was found to inhibit the function of multiple PDK isoforms. Attempts to maximize intracellular TPP by exploiting thiamine homeostasis gene expression resulted in enhanced apoptosis in tumor cells. Based on our in vitro evaluations, we conclude that TPP serves as the active species mediating thiamine's inhibitory effect on tumor cell proliferation. Pharmacologic administration of benfotiamine, but not sulbutiamine, reduced tumor growth in a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model. It remains unclear if benfotiamine's effects in vivo are associated with PDK inhibition or through an alternative mechanism of action. Future work will aim to define the action of lipophilic thiamine mimetics in vivo in order to translate their clinical usefulness as anticancer strategies.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatigue is the most frequent and often debilitating symptom for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). There are no available effective therapies for fatigue associated with MS, and it is unclear whether a successful therapy of MS leads to clinical improvement. Sulbutiamine is a lipophilic compound that crosses the blood-brain barrier more readily than thiamine and increases the levels of thiamine and thiamine phosphate esters in the brain. Whereas several clinical trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of sulbutiamine in patients with asthenia, there have been no reports on the effects of sulbutiamine on fatigue in patients with MS. OBJECTIVES: Our study was designed to evaluate the short-term effects of sulbutiamine on fatigue in patients with MS. METHODS: Patients were included if fatigue was one of their three predominant symptoms. They were required to have a total score on the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) of >20, and on the Beck Depression Inventory of <17, and no relapse in the last 3 months prior to onset of the study. Patients were advised to receive 400mg orally of sulbutiamine once daily for two months. The outcome of the study was in the changes of FIS. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with MS (18 females and 8 males) were selected. The patients were 18-57 years of age (mean:37,2). The average score of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of the patients was 2,71. A significant number of the subjects who were on some kind of disease modifying treatment (DMT) demonstrated obvious improvement in their total FIS scores, whereas none of the subjects who were not on any DMT improved (13/23 vs. 0/5). The average fatigue score was 77 (SD:30,5) at the baseline and 60,5 (SD:29,7) on Day 60, respectively. Sulbutiamine intake resulted in a significant reduction on the total score of FIS and on all three subscales assessing physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning (all p-values < 0,01). There were no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Sulbutiamin appears to be effective in treating fatigue in MS; particularly in patients who were on some DMT, but not on those who were not. It is well-tolerated by all. This observation may encourage further evaluations of the efficacy of sulbutiamine on fatigue in MS.",

Here we study the effect of sulbutiamine, a synthetic thiamine analogue that can cross the blood-brain barrier easily, on hippocampal neurons under an in vitro model of ischemia, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). We find that exposure to OGD in the presence of sulbutiamine significantly increases neuronal viability and enhances electrophysiological properties such as excitatory synaptic transmissions and intrinsic neuronal membrane input resistance in a concentration-dependent manner. Overall, here we report, for the first time, the neuroprotective evidence of sulbutiamine on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons under OGD, which may have beneficial implications as a possible therapeutic agent/substance against ischemic insult.",

The presence of sulbutiamine in urinary doping control samples was monitored to evaluate the relevance of its use in sports. As one of the sulbutiamine metabolites has very close retention time and the same characteristic ion (m/z 194) as the main boldenone metabolite, the raw data files generated from the screening for anabolic steroids were automatically reprocessed to identify the samples containing sulbutiamine. It was found that of ca. 16 000 samples analyzed in the Russian laboratory during 2009, about 100 samples contained sulbutiamine. It is important to note that most of these samples were collected in-competition, and sulbutiamine concentration was estimated to be greater than 500 ng/ml.

Sulbutiamine did not modify memory in the DNMTS task but improved it in the object recognition task. Dizocilpine, impaired both acquisition and retention of the DNMTS task in the saline-treated group, but not in the two sulbutiamine-treated groups, suggesting that sulbutiamine may counteract the amnesia induced by a blockade of the N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors.

      "abstract": "AIMS OF THE STUDY: Asthenic symptoms such as weakness accompany illness. This study investigates whether the centrally acting cholinergic agent, vitamin B analogue (sulbutiamine), is effective and acceptable in relieving these symptoms in infectious disease when combined with specific anti-infective treatment. METHODOLOGY: In a prospective uncontrolled, non-randomised, commercial, observational study, 1772 patients with an infectious disease and asthenic symptoms, drawn from the practice of 350 randomly selected physicians throughout India, received vitamin B analogue (sulbutiamine) in addition to specific anti-infective treatment for 15 days. The primary outcome variable was complete resolution of asthenic symptoms with treatment. RESULTS: The number (%, 95% confidence interval) of patients with complete resolution of all asthenic symptoms was 916 (51.7, 49.4-54). In the remaining patients, severe asthenia was reduced but persisted in 11 (0.6, 0-26); and moderate asthenia in 94 (5.3, 0-17.6). The response was greater in patients with acute infection and symptoms more related to cerebral function. Side effects occurred in 10 (0.6%), patients and well being improved significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin B analogue (sulbutiamine) may be a useful adjunct to specific anti-infective treatment.",

      "abstract": "Asthenia is the most frequent medical reason for people seeking help from their physician. In 75% of cases, the cause is functional (either reactive or psychiatric) and in 25% it is organic. In order to provide patients with rapid relief of symptoms, appropriate antiasthenic treatment should be initiated immediately, while at the same time, adequate clinical and laboratory assessments should be performed to detect the underlying cause of asthenia. Sulbutiamine, a highly lipophilic thiamine derivative, is the only antiasthenic compound known to cross the blood-brain barrier and to be selectively active on specific brain structures directly involved in asthenia. This article reviews the current knowledge on the effects of sulbutiamine in animal models and in various forms of human asthenia."

They were randomly assigned either sulbutiamine (Arcalion(®)) (15 patients) or no treatment (control group; 15 patients). Glycaemic control was assessed by blood glucose and HbA1. Severity of neuropathy was assessed by symptom and sign score, and electrophysiological parameters (nerve conduction velocity and compound muscle action potential) at entry to the study and after 6 weeks. There were improvements in the electrophysiological parameters in the treatment group when compared to the controls with significant improvement in the median nerve conduction velocity (p<0.001), median compound muscle action potential (p<0.001), peroneal nerve conduction velocity (p<0.001), and peroneal compound muscle action potential (p<0.001). No significant improvement in symptom and sign scores were noted between the groups but a significant improvement compared to base line was noted for the sulbutiamine treated group. (p< 0.05). The glycaemic control in both groups was not significantly different at base line and was stable throughout the study. Sulbutiamine objectively improved peripheral nerve function in diabetic polyneuropathy although the symptom score did not improve, possibly due to the short duration of the study."

In the same treated animals, an increase of D1 dopaminergic (DA) binding sites was measured both in the prefrontal and the cingular cortex, while no modification of the D2 binding sites was detected. Furthermore, an acute sulbutiamine administration induced a decrease of kainate binding sites but no change of the density of D1 and D2 DA receptors. Acute sulbutiamine injection led to a decrease of the DA levels in the prefrontal cortex and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels in both the cingular and the prefrontal cortex. These observations are discussed in terms of a modulatory effect of sulbutiamine on both dopaminergic and glutamatergic cortical transmissions.",

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Psycho-behavioural inhibition is characteristic of major depressive disorder and frequently recedes after the other depressive symptoms. This may induce an important psychosocial impairment which could be a risk factor for relapse. METHODS: The aim of this eight weeks, multicentric, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of sulbutiamine (Arcalion) [600 mg p.d.] on the symptoms of psycho-behavioural inhibition of inpatients with DSM III-R defined Major Depressive Episode (MDE) treated by adjusted doses of clomipramine [75 to 150 mg pd]. Moderate doses of hypnotics and anxiolytics without potential activity on the mood were authorized during the trial. The MDE was assessed with the MADRS, HAM-A and CGI scales. Patients who did not respond adequately to the antidepressant treatment were prematurely withdrawn from the trial. The three Sheehan Disability Scales (SDS), the Norris Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Depressive Psychomotor Retardation Scale (ERD) were used to monitor psycho-behavioural inhibition. RESULTS: The mean intake scores were, as expected, fairly high: MADRS (32), HAMA-A (23), CGI (5) and ERD (27). The SDS and EVA scores showed that the patients felt severely handicapped in their social, professional and family life functioning as well as in their emotional, affective, cognitive and behavioural performances. At four weeks the MADRS, HAM-A and CGI scores indicated that the global improvement of the MDE was comparable in both treatment groups. However, the scores at the EVA and SDS scales showed that the patients treated with sulbutiamine were significantly less incapacitated than the placebo group in all of the various facets (affective, cognitive, emotional, behavioural) of psycho-behavioural inhibition. Furthermore, the safety data shows that both treatment groups were comparable and in particular that sulbutiamine had not induced any inappropriate behaviour, including suicide attempts, or mania. CONCLUSIONS: Sulbutiamine has no antidepressive effect but it can hasten the resorption of psycho-behavioural inhibition occurring during major depressive disorder and thereby facilitate the rehabilitation of patients in their social, professional and family life functioning.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Chronic fatigue remains a medical mystery and a therapeutic failure. The subgroup of chronic fatigue postinfectious fatigue (CPIF) is an interesting one since it is quite frequent in general practice. METHODS: We studied sulbutiamine (Su), isobutyryl-thiamine disulfide in this context. We included 326 general-practice patients suffering from CPIF: they received randomly either Su, 400 mg daily (n = 106), or Su, 600 mg daily (n = 111), or placebo (n = 109) for 28 days in a double-blind, parallel-group study. 315 patients completed the study. RESULTS: The evaluation of fatigue, by multiple means including mainly MFI, a validated multidimensional fatigue scale, showed overall no significant difference between the groups. On the 7th day, however, women receiving Su, 600 mg had less fatigue (P < 0.01), but the figures were quite diverse and no persistent effect was noted at the 28th day. CONCLUSION: Thus, we showed for the first time that a high level general-practice study of fatigue is feasible using specific tools. Whether the effect observed after 1 week in women represents a true finding needs additional research. Further studies are in progress in order to characterize better the potential usefulness of Su in chronic fatigue.",

The present experiment was aimed at testing whether, inversely, chronic administration of large doses of sulbutiamine would have a facilitative effect on memory and would induce changes in central cholinergic activity. Accordingly mice received 300 mg/kg of sulbutiamine daily for 10 days. They were then submitted to an appetitive operant level press conditioning test. When compared to control subjects, sulbutiamine treated mice learned the task at the same rate in a single session but showed greatly improved performance when tested 24 hr after partial acquisition of the same task. Parallel neurochemical investigations showed that the treatment induced a slight (+ 10%) but significant increase in hippocampal sodium-dependent high affinity choline uptake. The present findings and previous results suggest that sulbutiamine improves memory formation and that this behavioral effect could be mediated by an increase in hippocampal cholinergic activity.",
