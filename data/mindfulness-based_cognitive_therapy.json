      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional gastrointestinal disorder causing a great burden on patients' lives due to its physical and psychological symptoms. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has previously alleviated IBS symptoms. Bioenergy economy (BEE) is a novel mind-body intervention that has shown moderating effects on many psychological and physical symptoms, particularly in chronic diseases. This research aimed to compare the effectiveness of MBCT and BEE on IBS symptom severity, somatic symptoms, depression, and anxiety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted using a quasi-experimental method with a pre-test, post-test, and follow-up design with a control group in Isfahan, Iran. Forty-five patients with IBS were divided into two experimental and one control group (15 subjects in each group). The patients were assessed using the ROME III Diagnostic Criteria for IBS, IBS Severity Index (IBS-SI), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15) before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed using analysis of covariance, and SPSS-22 software was used. RESULTS: The findings showed that MBCT and BEE both had significant effects on the IBS symptom severity, somatic symptoms, depression, and anxiety (P < 0.01), but there was no significant difference between the mean scores of the two experimental groups in any of the post-test or the follow-up stages (P > 0.05). This concludes that there was no difference between the effectiveness of MBCT and BEE programs (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Although both interventions had significant results in improving patients' symptoms, the BEE program had a stronger and wider range of effectiveness."

      "abstract": "This article explores the potential relevance of Mindfulness-Based Programs, particularly Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), to support the mission of higher education by facilitating the journey from information to knowledge, and from knowledge to wisdom. It thus addresses the problems of distractibility and superficial engagement caused by information overload and aims to prepare students for a fulfilling life. Based upon an in-depth dialogue among authors belonging to different disciplines, this conceptual synthesis integrates the various perspectives of Buddhist studies, philosophy of education, anthropology of education, clinical psychology, and psychiatry, to construct a comprehensive view of mindfulness for higher education. The structure of its argument progresses from the languishing to the flourishing of students, and from mindfulness taught in the form of interventions, to mindfulness cultivated as the very thread of learning. The article starts by reviewing the evidence regarding students' mental health and vulnerabilities, and moves to directly listening to their voices, larger aspirations, and more existential concerns. It next elaborates an epistemic and developmental model of mindful education, making creative use of T. S. Eliot's questions regarding information, knowledge, wisdom, and Life, to capture some ongoing, complex issues. MBCT's principles, formats, practices, and adaptations are then examined to envision skillful responses to these perceived challenges, with a proposal to further weave mindfulness into the constitution of higher education. Ultimately, in reference to Simone Weil, mindfulness training is conceived as guiding the \"formation of attention,\" along the \"joy of learning,\" to accomplish two interrelated humanistic ideals: academic excellence and human flourishing."

      "abstract": "Background: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is effective in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Understanding for whom and how MBCT works may allow for improvements in treatment allocation and effectiveness. In this study, our aim was to investigate depressive rumination, content-independent perseverative thinking, mindfulness skills, and self-compassion as potential moderators and mediators of MBCT. Methods: In this non-randomized controlled trial, patients with persistent (n = 53) or recurrent MDD with (n = 31) or without (n = 51) a current depressive episode were assigned to an intervention (MBCT plus treatment as usual [TAU], n = 94) or control group (TAU only, n = 40) based on the time between the date of inclusion and the start of MBCT. Assessments were carried out before, halfway, and after 8 weeks of MBCT + TAU or TAU. Latent growth models were employed to examine moderation, while cross-lagged structural equation models were used to assess the mediating effects of several possible mediators of MBCT-induced change in depressive symptoms and overall functional impairment. Results: MBCT + TAU was more effective in reducing depressive symptoms (and overall functional impairment than TAU with a medium [d = -0.54] and small [d = 0.44] effect size, respectively). Higher baseline levels of rumination and perseverative thinking and lower levels of self-compassion moderated the effect of MBCT on depressive symptoms and overall functional impairment. Task-based negative intrusive thoughts moderated the effects of MBCT on overall functional impairment. No mediators were established, particularly due to a lack of effect of MBCT on all assessed mediators at mid-treatment. For interpretative purposes, a sample split (based on Johnson-Newman values) showed moderate-to-large effects in depressive symptom reduction for those with high rumination, high perseverative thinking, and low self-compassion, while negative-to-small nonsignificant effects were found for the opposite traits. Conclusion: In the future, MBCT allocation based on levels of rumination and self-compassion might lead to a more efficient reduction in depressive symptoms. Directions for mediation analysis within the context of MBCT for depression are discussed. Preregistration: This study was initially preregistered in the Dutch National Trial Register (NL7842). However, due to the NTR no longer being available since June 2022, the trial was reregistered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05802966, dd 09-Apr-2023). The statistical analysis plan was adjusted after the start of the trial but before the finalization of data collection (NCT05802966; ClinicalTrials.gov).",

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for children (MBCT-C) is an adapted version of traditional MBCT that targets emotional problems in children. The present study aimed to provide a framework for the implementation of a clinical trial for its effectiveness in reducing anxiety, depression, and IA in adolescents with IA. This study protocol proposes a randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms (MBCT-C versus active control). Eighty Iranian adolescents (Persian ethnicity; males and females; 12 to 15 years) diagnosed with IA will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (12 sessions of MBCT-C group therapy) or the control group (12 life skills training sessions). Pre-intervention, post-intervention, and three-month follow-up assessments will be conducted using Mindful Attention Awareness Scale-Adolescents (MAAS-A), Mindfulness Program Satisfaction Questioner (MPSQ), Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Children (STAI-C), MBCT-C Adherence Scale (MBCT-C-AS), and Internet Addiction Test (IAT). Data will be analyzed using mixed regression model using STATA-18 to assess the effectiveness of MBCT-C. The current study has the potential to make a significant contribution to evaluate the effectiveness of MBCT-C to address IA, anxiety, and depression in adolescents with IA.",

      "abstract": "Internet gaming disorder (IGD) affects 3% of the global population and poses an increasing risk due to advancements in technology. However, there is currently no definitive treatment for this condition. IGD is not a primary disorder but rather a result of \"self-prescription\" in response to emotional stressors. Unlike conventional mental health treatments that focus on the disorder itself, it is crucial to provide alternative activities that can alleviate negative emotions. This paper extends the concept of the self-medication hypothesis and integrates it with cognitive models of cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. In addition, it introduces the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy-game (MBCT-G), a program designed to explore alternative activities through gaming, focusing on the processes of response and reward, which are not typically emphasized in traditional treatments. This study serves as the theoretical foundation for the development of MBCT-G. MBCT-G aims to train individuals in positive coping strategies that alleviate psychological distress, offering a novel approach to treating self-prescription disorders such as IGD.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The research method was a three-stage, three-group semiexperimental design. To this end, the statistical population including all the employees who worked in the technical departments of Tam Kar Company in Isfahan and in terms of the level of stress in middle and higher levels, using purposive sampling, 60 employees were selected and randomly divided into three groups (20 for each group). Geldard (1989) burnout inventory (GBI) was used for data collection. Experimental group 1 received eight 90-min sessions of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy training, and experimental group 2 received job stress coping training in ten 90-min sessions. Repeated measurement ANOVA was used to analyze the data with the help of a statistical software package in social sciences (SPSS) version 22. RESULTS: The results showed that coping with job stress training and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy were equally effective in reducing the employees' burnout (P ≤ 0.05) and this effect continued at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Given the high prevalence of burnout and psychopathologic symptoms among industry staff, coping with job stress training and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy training can be suggested to reduce burnout syndrome in the industry."

MBCT is a clinical intervention that integrates cognitive therapy with mindfulness practices to prevent depression relapses and improve mental health. Methods: The review focuses on the effects of MBCT on brain structure changes, cognitive processes, and emotional regulation, which are related to improvements in subjective well-being. A total of 87 studies were included in the review to assess the effectiveness of MBCT. Results: Evidence from the studies highlights the effectiveness of MBCT in reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. MBCT was also shown to enhance cognitive functions and emotional regulation across diverse populations. These findings point to the potential for MBCT to induce neuroplastic changes in the brain and widen the applicability of the treatment for a variety of disorders, calling for further research into long-term benefits and underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Conclusions: The review emphasizes the potential of MBCT to bring about neuroplastic changes, calling for further research into its long-term benefits and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. This study underlines the need to incorporate multidisciplinary measures by integrating psychology and neuroscience to comprehend comprehensively the effects of MBCT."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has emerged as a promising intervention for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). This study evaluated MBCT's effectiveness for GAD and examined whether childhood maltreatment moderates its impact. METHODS: Individuals with GAD were randomized to receive one of two 8-week interventions, either MBCT in-person or psychoeducation on-line (n = 27 per group). At baseline and after 4 and 8 weeks of intervention, both groups were assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory and Penn State Worry Questionnaire as well as several secondary questionnaires. Changes in the severity of anxiety and worry over time, as determined using linear mixed modeling, were compared between the two groups as a whole and among subgroups stratified according to type of maltreatment in childhood. RESULTS: Among all participants, severity of worry decreased significantly more in the MBCT group than in the psychoeducation group, whereas severity of anxiety decreased to a similar extent in the two groups. Among individuals who had experienced emotional abuse in childhood, MBCT reduced the severity of anxiety significantly more than psychoeducation. In fact, MBCT was significantly more effective against anxiety in individuals who had experienced emotional abuse than in those who had not. CONCLUSIONS: MBCT might be effective in alleviating worry symptoms in GAD, while its effectiveness against anxiety symptoms appears to be influenced by the history of maltreatment, particularly emotional abuse.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence has shown that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is effective in improving depressive symptoms in the older population. However, the accessibility to MBCT is limited by the shortage of psychotherapists or mindfulness teachers. One potential solution is to involve social workers, who have the knowledge and skills to promote individual and community well-being in various settings, in delivering modified MBCT to enhance its accessibility and sustainability. This study examined the effectiveness of an eight-week age-modified MBCT led by different mental health professionals (mindfulness teacher only vs. mindfulness teacher and social worker) in improving mental health outcomes as compared with a control group. METHODS: Older adults (N = 112) were recruited through five community-based centres for older adults and mental wellness in Hong Kong. Participants were allocated to one of three groups: (1) mindfulness teacher-led modified MBCT, (2) social worker/teacher co-led modified MBCT (50% led by social workers and 50% led by mindfulness teacher), or (3) control (care as usual). The age-modified MBCT consisted of eight weekly sessions, with age-related modifications including more sitting meditation, shortened duration of each session, and the removal of the retreat. Outcome variables (i.e., depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, and mindfulness) were assessed at baseline (T0), after the intervention (T1), and four weeks after the intervention (T2), through self-reported questionnaires. Linear mixed models were performed while controlling for demographic variables to examine changes in outcome variables between the groups. RESULTS: Participants from the age-modified MBCT intervention groups (teacher-led and social worker/teacher co-led) showed significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms and stress, as well as greater increase in mindful non-reactivity, compared to the control group post-intervention. No significant interaction effect of time and group was found for anxiety and both overall mindfulness and its other facets. The improvements in mental health and mindfulness outcomes post-intervention were not significantly different between the teacher-led and social worker/teacher co-led MCBT groups. DISCUSSION: Age-modified MBCT is beneficial in managing depressive and stress symptoms and in improving mindful non-reactivity among older adults at risk for depression. The findings support the feasibility and effectiveness of partial task-shifting in the delivery of MBCT to trained social workers. Future studies may explore the possibility for social workers in leading MBCTs independently to further improve its scalability and service accessibility for older adults in the community.

Participants were randomized to a remotely delivered mindfulness intervention (MBCT-Brief) or heart disease education, both 8 weeks long. Follow-up was 6 months. Changes in stress (PSS-10; primary outcome) and secondary outcomes (depressive symptoms, anxiety, quality of life, disease-specific health status, actigraphy-assessed sleep) were compared between groups. RESULTS: The sample included 130 women with MI (mean age 59.8 ± 12.8 years, 34% racial/ethnic minorities). In intention-to-treat analysis, PSS-10 scores declined in the MBCT-Brief arm (-0.52 [95% CI: -0.77 to -0.28]) but not the heart disease education arm (-0.19 [95% CI: -0.45 to 0.06]; group×time interaction P = 0.070). The effect was stronger in per-protocol analysis of participants who completed ≥4 intervention sessions (P = 0.049). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes in intention-to-treat or per-protocol analyses. Within the MBCT-Brief arm, more frequent mindfulness practice was associated with greater reductions in stress (P = 0.007), depressive symptoms (P = 0.017), and anxiety (P = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: MBCT-Brief was associated with greater 6-month reductions in stress than an active control among adherent participants. More frequent mindfulness practice was associated with greater improvements in psychological outcomes. Strategies to engage women with MI in mindfulness training and support regular home practice may enhance these effects."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The birth and admission of a premature infant to the NICU is often an unexpected experience and a mental and spiritual challenge for families. Spiritual health is an influential factor affecting how a mother faces and endures a stressful situation. Improving the mother's spiritual health requires cognitive therapy approaches, including mindfulness techniques. Nurses can help mothers of infants admitted to the NICU to go through the hospitalization period more peacefully by using mindfulness techniques. To this end, the present study sought to investigate the effect of a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) program on spiritual health in mothers of infants admitted to the NICU. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study was conducted using a pre-test-post-test design in two intervention and control groups. The participants were 50 mothers of infants admitted to the NICU of Afzalipur Hospital, Kerman, who were selected via convenience sampling and randomly divided into two control and intervention groups (25 mothers in each group). The intervention involved providing counseling using a short-term mindfulness-based cognitive therapy program carried out in four 2-h sessions for the participants in the intervention group. The participants in the control group received routine NICU care. The participants in both groups completed a demographic information questionnaire and the Spiritual WellBeing Scale (SWBS) before and after the intervention. The collected data were analyzed with SPSS-25 software. RESULTS: The data showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of demographic characteristics (P > 0.05). Moreover, the mean score of spiritual health in the intervention group was 92.80 ± 12.14 and that of the control group was 92.16 ± 16.35 before the intervention. The mean score of spiritual health in the intervention group was 104.04 ± 6.60 and that of the control group was 92.56 ± 16.35 after the intervention. The results of the paired samples t-test revealed a statistically significant difference in the mean scores of spiritual health and its dimensions before and after the intervention in the intervention group (P < 0.001). DISCUSSION: The findings from the present study indicated that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy intervention was effective in improving the spiritual health of mothers with infants admitted to the NICU. NICU nurses can use mindfulness-based cognitive therapy as a practical intervention to improve the spiritual health of mothers of premature infants and promote the sense of meaningfulness and meaning of life in these mothers."

METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted with individuals diagnosed with treatment-resistant GAD. group A included patients unresponsive to citalopram, imipramine, paroxetine, and sertraline, who were then treated with low-dose Escitalopram (10 mg) combined with MBCT. group B comprised those unresponsive to venlafaxine and duloxetine, who were treated with Desvenlafaxine (25 mg) alongside MBCT. Participants were monitored over 24 weeks for changes in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) scores, with medication adherence measured using the Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS). The primary outcomes focused on the improvement in anxiety symptoms and overall mental well-being. RESULTS: Comparative analysis between the groups showed significant improvement in HAM-A and MAAS scores at week 16 in group B compared to group A (P < 0.01). Within-group analysis also demonstrated a significant reduction in scores at week 12 in group B compared to group A at week 16 (P < 0.01). No significant difference was observed in medication adherence between the two groups (P = 0.122). CONCLUSION: Patients treated with low-dose Desvenlafaxine combined with MBCT exhibited greater improvements in managing treatment-resistant GAD compared to those treated with low-dose Escitalopram. This approach highlights the potential for more inclusive and effective mental health strategies, contributing to enhanced quality of life and well-being.",

      "abstract": "Low-income, urban-dwelling Black adults are disproportionately affected by traumatic experiences, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression and encounter inequities in treatment access. In addition to the benefits Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) for depression, there is preliminary evidence of successful symptom reduction in PTSD via MBCT across two prior pilot studies in veterans. Studies examining the effects of MBCT among trauma-exposed Black adults remains limited, and examination of effects across specific PTSD clusters is almost nonexistent. We examined the preliminary efficacy of adapted MBCT versus waitlist control (WLC) on PTSD and depression symptoms in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). Black adults (N = 80; 86.10 % women) with repeated trauma exposure, who screened positive for PTSD and depression, were recruited from an urban public hospital and randomized to 8-week adapted MBCT or WLC. Symptoms were measured pretreatment and posttreatment with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Mixed model analyses were conducted with an intent-to-treat approach, examining change in PTSD and depression scores between MBCT and WLC over time. There was no significant difference in total PTSD and depression symptom change between MBCT and WLC. CAPS-5 avoidance symptoms showed a nominally significant decrease in the MBCT group (F[1, 68.10] = 5.98, p = .017; t[71.60] = 3.61, p < .001). Findings suggest MBCT might be helpful for addressing avoidance symptoms among Black adults with comorbid PTSD and depression. Although lacking power to draw final conclusions about treatment efficacy, this study provides preliminary data suggesting the importance of future fully powered trials."

      "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Background/ Objective: Due to the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on personal and social life, people living with HIV (PLWH) are faced with several challenges and issues. Therefore, PLWH requires psychological interventions. The study aims were to create a suitable platform for psychological structures that empower them to address their issues effectively. In this regard, we evaluated the effect of Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Silva-based Relaxation Therapy (SBRT) on Psychological Capital (PsyCap), Social Anxiety (SA), and CD4 count in PLWH. METHODS: This study employed an intervention-based semi-experimental design. The population consisted of 90 individuals infected with HIV. Participants were divided into two experimental groups receiving MBCT and SBRT, respectively, and one control group, selected randomly. Before and after the intervention, questionnaires and CD4+ tests were administered to the participants. Only two experimental groups received the intervention, while the control group received no training. The appropriate training for each group was conducted twice a week over eight sessions and each session lasted 90 minutes. In the intervention groups, all the people participated in all the group training sessions. No intervention was performed for the participants of the control group, and they only completed the questionnaires in the same period as the intervention groups. \"Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy\" and \"Mind Control\" books were used for the implementation of MBCT and SBRT, respectively. RESULTS: It was revealed that a number of male participants constituted the majority with 58 (64.4%) compared to females. Regarding the means of transmission, sexual contact was the most common with 62 (68.8%) compared to other routes. The mean age of the participants was 40.5 ± 10.8 years. For the SBRT group, the mean CD4+ count was higher, with 599.5 ± 290.9 for pretest and 563.2 ± 366.7 for post-test assessments, compared to other groups. After performing the linear regression analysis, it was found that the variables had no effect on the main outcome, which is CD4 count after the intervention (p-value= 0.27). For the MBCT group, the CD4+ count variable had a p-value = 0.10 (pretest: 447.2 ± 19.5, posttest: 411.9 ± 235.9), for the SBRT group, the CD4+ count variable had a p-value = 0.05 (pretest: 599.5 ± 290.9, posttest: 549 ± 259.9), and the control group, the CD4+ count variable had a p-value = 0.5 (pretest: 445 ± 222.7, posttest: 563.2 ± 366.7). CONCLUSION: MBCT and SBRT may enhance the mental well-being of PLWH. Therefore, following the interventions, the mean level of SA decreased, and PsyCap increased. Thus, strategies to improve psychological support interventions may have a significant impact on improving the health status of individuals living with HIV, including indicators of SA and PsyCap."

      "abstract": "The commonly used protocol for the treatment of panic disorder has been the application of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). With the advent of third-wave psychotherapies such as acceptance and commitment therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), which focuses on experiential acceptance, there have been variations in the treatment of panic disorder. However, no case report has adopted an integrated treatment protocol using elements of CBT and MBCT. Here, we have presented a practical psychotherapy report of a 31-year-old woman who was treated over 16 sessions using such an integrated treatment protocol based on her personality and clinical profile. During the first phase of treatment, components of CBT were introduced to help her obtain firsthand evidence of her catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations and to change her underlying threat schemas related to physical sensations. Aspects of MBCT were implemented in the intermediate phase to allow awareness and observation of her anxiety sensitivity, discourage immediate reactivity, and reduce overall catastrophizing tendencies. Moreover, MBCT also served to prevent relapse by enriching her overall quality of life by cultivating present-moment awareness through encouraging full engagement in experiences rather than being consumed by future-oriented concerns."

Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate both the effectiveness and durability of MBCT in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. METHODS: We systematically searched six databases from June 11, 2023 to September 16, 2023 for randomized control trials (RCTs) of adults diagnosed with anxiety or depressive disorders as per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision or the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems diagnostic criteria; the treatment group received the complete form of MBCT, whereas the control group received other interventions or treatment as usual; the treatment outcome focused on symptoms of depression or anxiety. Two independent reviewers included studies, assessed quality, and extracted data. The Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2.0 tool was applied to appraise the methodological quality of the included studies. R 4.2.1 software and the \"metafor\" package were used to estimate the effect sizes based on mean and standard deviation of anxiety and depressive disorders at baseline and postintervention, and at postintervention and follow-up periods for both the treatment and control groups. RESULT: A total of 1,470 studies were reviewed, and 21 RCTs met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed an overall standardized mean difference of -0.4806 [CI: -0.7185; -0.2428] and -0.3817 [CI: -0.5407; -0.2228] for reducing anxiety and depression symptoms, respectively indicating the effectiveness of MBCT. Comparison between postintervention and follow-up or follow-up measurement showed a small and nonsignificant effect size for depression (0.0130 [CI: -0.2109; 0.2369]) and anxiety (0.0198 [CI: -0.0660; 0.1057]), suggesting that recovered symptoms in the treatment group were maintained until the follow-up evaluation. CONCLUSION: MBCT produces long-term treatment effects in the management of both depressive and anxiety disorders. PROTOCOL PREREGISTRATION: The current meta-analysis followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and got registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023465494)."

      "abstract": "The pervasiveness of anxiety and stress among college students necessitates the investigation of potential alternative and accessible interventions which can be implemented into existing curricular and student-support programming to improve students' mental health. Mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) smartphone applications have shown promising outcomes in alleviating anxiety and stress. However, it is essential to gain insight into the feasibility and efficacy of such an interventional approach in a collegiate population, as well as explore potential underlying mechanisms, which could be better targeted to enhance the efficacy of future interventions for promoting mental health and well-being. The aims for this study were (1) to assess the efficacy of a 4-week MBCT intervention using the Sanvello smartphone application in reducing trait-level anxiety and chronic stress in college-aged young adults (n = 150) compared to a positive control group (n = 139), and (2) to examine potential mediators of this effect. Participants completed assessments of trait anxiety, chronic stress, cognitive reappraisal, cognitive refocusing, distractive refocusing, and negative automatic thoughts at pretest and following 4 weeks of the interventions. Analysis of primary outcomes revealed greater reductions in trait anxiety and chronic stress for the MBCT group, relative to the positive control group with small to moderate effect sizes. The anxiolytic and stress-reducing effects of the MBCT intervention were observed to be mediated by changes in negative automatic thoughts but not by changes in cognitive reappraisal, constructive refocusing, or distractive refocusing. Given the efficacy of the Sanvello smartphone application and the overwhelmingly strong assessments of the appropriateness and feasibility of it use; student support initiatives may be well served by adopting such a platform within the context of first-line treatment and prevention of high anxiety and chronic stress within first year college students.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Anxiety disorder is one of the most prevalent mental disorders. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is effective for treating anxiety disorders. However, no studies have investigated the cost-effectiveness of MBCT for anxiety disorders. We aimed to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to clarify the cost-effectiveness of MBCT for anxiety disorders. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis alongside an RCT was conducted for 8 weeks in 40 patients with anxiety disorders at a university hospital. Patients (1) aged 20-75 years; (2) who were diagnosed with panic disorder/agoraphobia or social anxiety disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria; and (3) who provided written consent were analyzed. The participants were allocated randomly (1:1 ratio) to the augmented MBCT group (i.e., MBCT plus treatment as usual [TAU]) or TAU (waitlist control) group. The cost-effectiveness was assessed using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which is the ratio of the incremental costs divided by the incremental state-trait anxiety inventory- state (STAI-S), state-trait anxiety inventory- trait (STAI-T), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The QALYs were estimated using The Japanese version of EuroQoL five-dimensional 3-level questionnaire. The unit cost data were derived from the government-regulated fees. This study was conducted from a public healthcare insurance perspective. No discount rates were considered. RESULTS: A total of 38 participants with complete data were included in the analysis. The MBCT was JPY 13,885 more than the cost of TAU and was associated with a STAI-S, STAI-T, and QALY increase of 10.13, 12.00, 0.009 respectively. The ICER were JPY 1,371 (USD13) per STAI-S, JPY 1,157 (USD 11) per STAI-T, and JPY 1,566,357 (USD 14,940) per QALY respectively. MBCT had an 77.5% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold in Japan (JPY 5,000,000 per QALY). The results of the four one-way sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of the base-case analysis findings. DISCUSSION: Augmented MBCT for anxiety disorders is cost-effective compared with TAU post-treatment from a public healthcare insurance perspective. Future studies should include long-term observations, and analysis from a societal perspective."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Personalised management of recurrent depression, considering individual patient characteristics, is crucial. AIMS: This study evaluates the potentially different mediating role of mindfulness skills in managing recurrent depression using mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) among people with varying depression severity. METHOD: Data from the Prevention of Depressive Relapse or Recurrence (PREVENT) trial, comparing MBCT (with antidepressant medication (ADM) tapering support, MBCT-tapering support) versus maintenance-ADM, were used. The study included pre, post, 9-, 12-, 18- and 24-month follow-ups. Adults with ≥3 previous major depressive episodes, in full/partial remission (below threshold for a current episode), on ADM, were assessed for eligibility in primary care practices in the UK. People were randomised (1:1) to MBCT-tapering support or maintenance-ADM. We used the Beck Depression Inventory-II to evaluate depressive symptom changes over the six time points. Pre-post treatment, we employed the Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire to gauge mindfulness skills. Baseline symptom and history variables were used to identify individuals with varying severity profiles. We conducted Latent Profile Moderated-Mediation Growth Mixture Models. RESULTS: A total of 424 people (mean (s.d.) age = 49.44 (12.31) years; with 325 (76.7%) self-identified as female) were included. A mediating effect of mindfulness skills, between trial arm allocation and the linear rate of depressive symptoms change over 24 months, moderated by depression severity, was observed (moderated-mediation index = -0.27, 95% CI = -0.66, -0.03). Conditional indirect effects were -0.42 (95% CI = -0.78, -0.18) for higher severity (expected mean BDI-II reduction = 10 points), and -0.15 (95% CI = -0.35, -0.02) for lower severity (expected mean BDI-II reduction = 3.5 points). CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness skills constitute a unique mechanism driving change in MBCT (versus maintenance-ADM). Individuals with higher depression severity may benefit most from MBCT-tapering support for residual symptoms. It is unclear if these effects apply to those with a current depressive episode. Future research should investigate individuals who are not on medication. This study provides preliminary evidence for personalised management of recurrent depression.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Fatigue is prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in remission. Previously, we showed that fatigued IBD patients experienced a significant decrease in fatigue after receiving mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). The current study examined to what extent these short-term beneficial effects of MBCT on fatigue were maintained over nine months follow-up, and whether patient characteristics were associated with clinically relevant improvement in fatigue. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial, including an MBCT and waiting-list control condition, was performed in fatigued IBD patients in remission. For this study, we analysed long-term outcomes of 108 patients who received MBCT (either directly or after three months waiting). The primary outcome was fatigue, assessed with the Checklist Individual Strenght-20. Secondary outcomes included fatigue interference, depression, anxiety, and quality of life. RESULTS: The reduced level of fatigue post-treatment did not change significantly during follow-up (F(2,76) = 1.68, p = 0.19). In total, 29% of patients reported clinically relevant improvement from pre-treatment to nine months follow-up. We found few significant differences in baseline characteristics between those reporting clinically relevant improvement and those not, except that patients who improved were significantly more often unemployed (χ2(1, n = 73) = 4.40, p = 0.04). Secondary outcomes, which did not change significantly during MBCT, also remained stable during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that reductions in IBD-related fatigue after receiving MBCT are sustained over nine months follow-up, with around one-third of patients reporting clinically relevant improvement from pre-treatment to follow-up. Employment status might be related to improvements in fatigue. Future research is needed to confirm these long-term outcomes. PREREGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03162575.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a viable alternative to maintenance antidepressant medication (M-ADM) to reduce risk of relapse/recurrence (RR) in recurrent depression, but its mechanism of action is not yet fully articulated. This secondary analysis of the PREVENT trial examined if MBCT with support to taper medication (MBCT-TS) reduces risk of RR in part by enhancing positive affect (PA). METHOD: In a single-blind, parallel, group randomized controlled trial, adults with ≥3 prior depressive episodes, but not currently in episode and who were taking M-ADM, were randomized to receive either MBCT-TS or ongoing maintenance M-ADM. The primary outcome was RR over 24-month follow-up. Levels of positive affect were assessed at intake and posttreatment. The original PREVENT trial was preregistered (ISRCTN 26666654), but this secondary analysis was not. RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty-four individuals (predominantly female and of White British ethnicity) were recruited, with 212 randomized to each arm. MBCT-TS led to significantly greater PA relative to M-ADM at posttreatment assessment (Δ = 2.78, 95% CI [1.47, 4.08], p < .001). RR was experienced during follow-up by 194 individuals (100 M-ADM; 94 MBCT-TS). Greater intake PA predicted a reduced hazard of RR across treatments (p < .001; hazard ratio = .96, 95% CI [0.94, 0.98]). In individuals who had not relapsed by posttreatment with complete data (121 M-ADM; 145 MBCT-TS), greater increase in PA from intake to posttreatment mediated reduced risk of subsequent RR (p = .04). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that greater levels of PA predict reduced risk of RR and that MBCT-TS in part acts to protect from RR when withdrawing from M-ADM by increasing PA.

This systematic review aims to investigate the effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) as an intervention for individuals with TRD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We will conduct a thorough search for publications of randomized clinical trials and quasi-experimental studies in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science databases, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Furthermore, reference lists of included studies will be manually screened for additional relevant articles, with no restrictions on language or publication date. The search will be conducted from the inception of the databases until June 2024. Our PICO-guided research questions are: (1) In adults with Treatment-Resistant Depression, is MBCT more effective than standard care or other active treatments in reducing depressive symptoms? (2) In adults with Treatment-Resistant Depression, does MBCT demonstrate a comparable safety profile to standard care or other active treatments? The quality of the included studies will be assessed independently using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB 2). This study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy as an intervention for Treatment-Resistant Depression, and will employ the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to appraise the confidence in the evidence.

BACKGROUND: Migraine is commonly comorbid with elevated depressive symptoms. MBCT reduces depressive symptoms and shows promise to reduce migraine-related disability. An abbreviated and remotely delivered version of MBCT could increase access to care. METHODS: People with migraine and elevated depressive symptoms were recruited from a large urban health system. Participants were assigned in blocks of eight to receive an evidence-based MBCT-brief treatment, including eight weekly group classes and home practice delivered via telephone (MBCT-T) or video (MBCT-V); MBCT-T was randomly selected for the first block. Sessions were recorded and coded for treatment fidelity. Feasibility was assessed via session attendance (primary), homework completion, recruitment rate, and survey completion rate. Acceptability was assessed via the eight-item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8; primary), the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ), the System Usability Scale (SUS), and items assessing survey acceptability. Participants completed the Headache Disability Inventory (HDI) and Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report 16-item (QIDS-SR16) at baseline, mid-treatment, and post-treatment. Feasibility and acceptability rates were compared to a priori benchmarks. RESULTS: Participants (n = 16) were all female with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 45 (13) years, the majority of whom identified as White (13/16, 81%) and non-Hispanic (14/16, 88%). The intervention met the a priori criteria set for therapist fidelity to treatment protocol (mean [SD] MBCT-Treatment Acceptability and Competence Scale Adherence score 2.9 [0.2]), feasibility (mean [SD] session attendance was 7.9/8 [0.3]), and acceptability (mean [SD] CSQ-8 score 28.8 [3.3]) for the entire sample and for each treatment arm. The usability of the remote-delivery system was high across study participants (mean [SD] SUS score 84.8 [11.0]). Survey procedures were broadly deemed acceptable, with at least 80% participants either endorsing \"Agree\" or \"Strongly Agree\" across all items. Using Wilcoxon tests, we observed significant reductions in both the HDI (pre-treatment median [interquartile range] score 63 [40, 70] vs. post-treatment 36 [26, 54], p = 0.004) and the QIDS-SR16 (pre-treatment median [interquartile range] score 8 [5, 13] vs. post-treatment 4 [3, 6], p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: We found that remotely delivered MBCT-brief for migraine and depressive symptoms was feasible and acceptable to patients in both the telephone and video modalities. Intervention was associated with significant post-treatment reductions in headache-related disability and depressive symptomatology, findings that must be interpreted cautiously in the absence of a control group.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Following acute coronary syndrome (ACS), up to 40% of patients report elevated depressive symptoms which is associated with a two-fold increase in mortality risk due to behavioral and biological mechanisms. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) delivered via synchronous group videoconferencing could help reduce depressive symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To guide MBCT adaptation for ACS patients for a future clinical trial, this qualitative study aimed to explore ACS patients' (1) symptoms after ACS, (2) needs for behavioral health treatment, (3) perspectives on mindfulness intervention and group videoconference delivery, and (4) willingness to self-collect dried blood spots in a research study. METHODS: We compared ACS patients with and without depressive symptoms to highlight particularly relevant treatment topics for patients developing depression following ACS experience. From 2/2019-11/2019, we conducted semi-structured individual telephone interviews with N = 23 patients after ACS (N = 13 with and N = 10 without elevated depressive symptoms; 63.4 (SD = 8.5) years, 87% male, 96% non-Hispanic white, 7.1 (SD = 7.5) years since ACS). In qualitative content analyses, four independent coders coded each interview. RESULTS: Participants with depressive symptoms experienced emotional, physical, social, and health behavior problems, while those without depressive symptoms made positive health behavior changes and struggled with anxiety symptoms. Both groups were interested in a behavioral health treatment for emotional and social support. Most were willing to participate in a mindfulness group via videoconferencing; some preferred in-person, but accessibility and convenience outweighed these cons. Almost all were willing to self-collect dried blood spots and some were already familiar with this technique. CONCLUSION: ACS patients, especially those with depressive symptoms, need help managing a multitude of quality of life concerns that can be targeted with an adapted MBCT approach. A videoconference-delivered MBCT approach is of interest. Suggestions for adapting MBCT to target the needs of ACS patients are discussed."

METHODS: The data of middle-aged and elderly suicide survivors in the medical system and nursing records of our hospital from January 2018 to August 2023 were retrospectively collected. The patients were divided into conventional group and MBCT group according to whether they actively received MBCT. The general demographic data of the patients and the changes in the scores of Suicidal Ideation Scale (SSI), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Patient Health Questionnaire 15 (PHQ-15), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) at admission and 3 and 6 months of follow-up were collected. Propensity score matching was used to balance the baseline data of the 2 groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the effect of the inpatient care program on each score. RESULTS: A total of 160 patients were included in the study, including 100 patients in the MBCT group and 60 patients in the conventional group. There was no significant difference in baseline data between the 2 groups after matching (P > .05). Suicidal Ideation Scale score, BHS score, PHQ-15 score, and GDS-15 score in MBCT group were lower than those in conventional group at 6 months of follow-up (P < .05). At the same time, multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the intervention program was the main factor affecting the SSI (OR = 1.538, P = .010), BHS (OR = 1.614, P = .006), PHQ-15 (OR = 1.797, P = .001), and GDS-15 scores (OR = 1.642, P = .004) at 6 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The application of nurse-led MBCT in hospitalized elderly suicide survivors may reduce suicidal ideation, hopelessness, and depression and improve physical symptoms."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer patients often experience anxiety, impacting their Quality of Life (QOL) . Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is a 3rd generation psychotherapy from CBT combined with MBSR where mindfulness methods are carried out in a structured and scheduled manner, able to provide a pause between the stressor and the automatic response it causes. This study aimed to assess MBCT's effectiveness in alleviating anxiety and enhancing QOL in Stage III breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, with mild-moderate anxiety disorders. METHOD: The experimental research, conducted at Moewardi General Hospital Surakarta from March to June 2023, employed a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest control group design. Thirty subjects were divided into intervention (MBCT) and control (psychoeducation) groups. Participants completed demographic forms, disease history, and assessments using the Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale (HADS-A) and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). RESULT: There was a significant improvement in HADS-A scores in both groups (P <0.001) where the difference in the median HADS score in intervention group was higher compared to the control group. The effect of MBCT to the score improvement of HADS-A showed statistically significant results P=0.003 with HR 1.288. In the EORTC QLQ C30 Global score, the intervention group experienced a significant increase P<0.001, and in the control group, it did not significantly increase p=0.087 although multivariate analysis showed that MBCT was not significant in improving the global EORTC score. From the continued multivariate analysis of the EORTC QLQ C30 function, score improvement was significantly influenced by MBCT with P=0.035 and HR 3.086. Meanwhile, for the EORTC symptoms, score improvement was influenced by MBCT with P=0.005 and HR3.401. CONCLUSION: There is a score improvement in HADS-A and EORTC with the provision of MBCT psychotherapy and with the provision of psychotherapy. However, the HADS and EORTC improvement scores were significantly higher with MBCT compared to psychotherapy alone.",

METHODS: Analyses used data from Veterans at high-risk for suicide assigned to either MBCT-S (n = 71) or eTAU (n = 69) in a randomized clinical trial. Potential predictors (n = 55) included available demographic, clinical, and neurocognitive variables. Random forest models were used to predict risk of suicidal event (suicidal behaviors, or ideation resulting in hospitalization or emergency department visit) within 12 months following randomization, characterize the prediction, and develop a Personalized Advantage Index (PAI). RESULTS: A slightly better prediction model emerged for MBCT-S (AUC = 0.70) than eTAU (AUC = 0.63). Important outcome predictors for participants in the MBCT-S arm included PTSD diagnosis, decisional efficiency on a neurocognitive task (Go/No-Go), prior-year mental health residential treatment, and non-suicidal self-injury. Significant predictors for participants in the eTAU arm included past-year acute psychiatric hospitalizations, past-year outpatient psychotherapy visits, past-year suicidal ideation severity, and attentional control (indexed by Stroop task). A moderation analysis showed that fewer suicidal events occurred among those randomized to their PAI-indicated optimal treatment. CONCLUSIONS: PAI-guided treatment assignment may enhance suicide prevention outcomes. However, prior to real-world application, additional research is required to improve model accuracy and evaluate model generalization.",

      "abstract": "Depressive disorders are an enormous societal burden given their high prevalence and impact on all facets of being human (e.g., relationships, emotions, motivation). There is a variety of evidence-based psychological treatments, with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) being the gold standard for major depression. Research has shown that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) are an effective relapse prevention and treatment for depression and that MBIs can be integrated in individual therapy. Furthermore, various delivery modes (e.g., digital-delivered therapy) and settings are offered to best meet different needs and improve accessibility: Evidence suggests that therapist-guided digital CBT, blended therapy, and, to some degree, digitalized MBIs may be an efficacious supplement to traditional face-to-face therapy. This chapter provides an overview of the principles and evidence base for CBT and MBCT as well as different delivery modes for depressive disorders in adults. Finally, chances and challenges of integration are discussed as implications for practice, as well as recommendations and ideas for future research.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of aromatherapy with lavender and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for sexuality (MBCT-S) on female sexual function. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Health centers in Roudan city, Iran. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty married women, ages 18 to 45 years, were recruited using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Participants were selected from health centers in 2022 via convenience sampling. INTERVENTION AND MEASUREMENTS: Upon their completion of a demographic checklist and the FSFI as a pretest, participants were divided into three groups, including lavender aromatherapy (n = 20), MBCT-S (n = 20), and control (n = 20) through random selection with permutation blocks. All groups completed FSFI as a posttest. Data were analyzed by SPSS 26 using chi-square, Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney statistical tests. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference among the three groups before the intervention (p = .652), but there was a significant difference among them after the intervention (p = .001). There was a significantly positive difference between the intervention groups and the control group (p < .001). A significant relationship was observed among the three groups in sexual desire, pain, satisfaction, lubrication, and arousal. The mean scores of the posttest in sexual desire, pain, satisfaction, and lubrication were positively higher in the MBCT-S group than in the aromatherapy group, and both intervention groups showed the same effect for sexual arousal. Aromatherapy and counseling had no significant effect on improving sexual orgasm. CONCLUSION: MBCT-S can be used to improve many aspects of female sexual function, except for orgasm disorders; aromatherapy may improve sexual arousal.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anhedonia, deficits in motivation and pleasure, is a transdiagnostic symptom of psychopathology and negative prognostic marker. METHODS: In this randomized, parallel-arm clinical trial, a novel intervention, Behavioral Activation Treatment for Anhedonia (BATA), was compared to an individually administered Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) in a transdiagnostic cohort of adults with clinically significant anhedonia (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers NCT02874534 and NCT04036136). Participants received 8-15 individual psychotherapy sessions, once weekly, with either BATA (n = 61) or MBCT (n = 55) and completed repeated self-report assessment of anhedonia and other internalizing symptoms. RESULTS: Indicators of treatment feasibility were similar across conditions, though MBCT showed a trend towards greater attrition rates than BATA, with an adjusted odd's ratio of 2.04 [0.88, 4.73]. Treatment effects on the primary clinical endpoint of anhedonia symptoms did not significantly differ, with a 14-week estimated difference on the Snaith Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) of -0.20 [-2.25, 1.84] points in BATA compared to MBCT (z = 0.19, p = 0.845, d = 0.05). The expected 14-week change in SHAPS scores across conditions was -7.18 [-8.22, -6.15] points (z = 13.6, p < 0.001, d = 1.69). There were no significant differences in the proportion of participants demonstrating reliable and clinically significant improvements in SHAPS scores, or in the magnitude of internalizing symptom reductions. LIMITATIONS: Limitations included a modest sample size, lack of longer-term follow up data, and non-preregistered analytic plan. DISCUSSION: There was no evidence to support superior clinical efficacy of BATA over MBCT in a transdiagnostic cohort of adults with elevated anhedonia. Both interventions reduced anhedonia symptoms to a comparable magnitude of other existing treatments.",

It is necessary to implement timely psychological intervention for the caregivers of allergic rhinitis children. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is a safe and effective psychological therapy, and the effect of online intervention can be comparable to the traditional face-to-face intervention program. This study focused on the mental health status in the main caregivers of children with allergic rhinitis, and conducted a modified online MBCT intervention on the caregivers, in order to improve their adverse mental state, meanwhile, improve the quality of care they provide. The results show that online MBCT intervention is applicable to the main caregivers of children with allergic rhinitis, and can effectively reduce caregiver burden, relieve anxiety and depression, and improve the level of mindfulness in the caregivers."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) presents a significant challenge, affecting approximately 30% of individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder and leading to poor treatment responses. Innovations in digital mental health, especially online mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (eMBCT), offer promising avenues for enhancing access to effective mental health care for individuals with TRD in a clinical setting. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of eMBCT in an individual clinical context to decrease depressive symptoms for TRD. METHODS: Conducted at the Institute of Psychiatry of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, this parallel-arm, randomized controlled feasibility trial involved outpatients diagnosed with TRD, aged 18 and above. Of the 39 outpatients invited, 28 were randomized into two groups: an intervention group receiving the eMBCT program (n = 15) and a control group (n = 13). The intervention, consisting of an 8-week course, was delivered via live video sessions. Following the assessment period, participants in the control group were offered the eMBCT intervention. Assessments using standardized questionnaires were conducted at the start and end of the study. RESULTS: Within the eMBCT group, improvements were observed in depression symptoms (Z = -3.423; p = 0.001; effect size r = 0.78), anxiety symptoms (Z = -3.361; p = 0.001; effect size r = 0.77), with no significant changes in the control group. Comparatively, the eMBCT group showed significant reductions in depression symptoms and improvements in clinical global impressions over the control group (BDI2: U = 30.5; p = 0.015; effect size r = 0.47, CGI1: U = 21.0; p = 0.004; effect size r = 0.56). CONCLUSION: eMBCT in an individual format combined with medication, appears to be a feasible treatment for TRD, decreasing symptoms of depression. In a future trial the control group may have a manualized intervention.

METHODS: Sixty-four eligible patients according to the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into the control group and the observation group, with 32 patients in each group. The control group received conventional therapy, while the observation group received MBCT on top of conventional therapy. The depressive symptoms, brain potential, and neuroimmunoinflammatory factors were measured in the two groups. RESULTS: After treatment, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score, tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin-6 levels were decreased, while the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale score, total number of response execution score, and 5-hydroxy tryptamine level were increased in both groups. Moreover, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score, tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin-6 levels were decreased more significantly, while the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale score, total number of response execution score, and 5-hydroxy tryptamine level were increased more significantly in the observation group compare to the control group ( P < 0.01). In addition, the latency in the observation group was shorter and the amplitude was longer than those in the control group ( P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with conventional therapy, the use of MBCT combined with conventional therapy can effectively reduce depressive symptoms, suppresses inflammatory responses, and optimize attention and response to target stimulation and is worthy of wide clinical implementation.",

A total of 80 participants (intervention n  = 43; standard care n  = 37) were included in the postintervention analysis. There were no statistically significant differences in the primary outcomes between the groups over time. An improvement was found, however, on the trait mindfulness observing subscale in favor of the intervention group. Eight sessions of MBCT integrated into an inpatient stroke rehabilitation program over 6 weeks was not effective in improving depression and anxiety compared to standard care.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People with Parkinson's disease (PD) are very sensitive to the effects of stress. The prevalence of stress-related neuropsychiatric symptoms is high, and acute stress worsens motor symptoms. Animal studies suggest that chronic stress may accelerate disease progression, but evidence for this in humans is lacking. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) train participants to focus on the present moment, on purpose and without judgement. Previous studies suggest that MBIs may alleviate stress and reduce depression and anxiety in PD. We aim to demonstrate the efficacy of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) as a non-pharmacologic treatment strategy for neuropsychiatric (and motor) symptoms in PD, and to identify the mechanisms underlying stress and stress reduction in PD. METHODS: In a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT), we investigate whether 8 weeks of MBCT, as compared to care as usual, can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression in people with PD. We aim to include 124 PD patients, who experience mild-moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression, are eligible for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and naïve to mindfulness, and who have a disease duration ≤ 10 years. Every participant is followed for 12 months. Clinical and biochemical assessments take place at baseline (T0), after 2 months (T1), and after 12 months (T2); MRI assessments take place at T0 and T2. Our primary outcome is the total score on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at T1, while correcting for the HADS score at T0, age, and gender. Beyond testing the effects of MBCT on symptoms of anxiety and depression in PD, we explore whether MBCT: (1) has an effect on motor symptom severity, (2) influences cerebral and biochemical markers of stress, and (3) leads to a change in biomarkers of PD progression. DISCUSSION: MIND-PD is one of the first RCTs with a 1-year follow-up to investigate the effects of MBCT on symptoms of anxiety and depression in PD, and to explore possible mechanisms underlying stress and stress reduction in PD. Insight into these mechanisms can pave the way to new treatment methods in the future. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05779137. Registered on 12 January 2023.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression poses a major threat to public health with an increasing prevalence in the United States. Mindfulness-based interventions, such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), are effective methods for managing depression symptoms and may help fortify existing efforts to address the current disease burden. The in-person group format of MBCT, however, incurs barriers to care such as expenses, childcare needs, and transportation issues. Alternate delivery modalities such as MBCT delivered via the web can be investigated for their capacity to overcome these barriers and still reduce symptoms of depression with adequate feasibility and efficacy. OBJECTIVE: This study protocol aims to examine the feasibility and efficacy of MBCT delivered via the web for the treatment of depression. METHODS: To attain study aims, 2 phases will be implemented using a waitlist control design. A total of 128 eligible participants will be randomized into either an 8-week MBCT intervention group plus treatment as usual (MBCT + TAU; group 1) or an 8-week waitlist control group (group 2). In phase I (8 weeks), group 1 will complete the intervention and group 2 will proceed with TAU. In phase II (8 weeks), group 2 will complete the intervention and group 1 will continue with TAU until reaching an 8-week follow-up. TAU may consist of receiving psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or combined treatment. Data collection will be completed at baseline, 8 weeks (postintervention for group 1 and preintervention for group 2), and 16 weeks (follow-up for group 1, postintervention for group 2). The primary outcomes will include (1) current, residual, or chronic depression symptoms and (2) psychiatric distress. Secondary outcomes will include perceived stress and facets of mindfulness. The feasibility will be measured by assessing protocol adherence, retention, attendance, and engagement. Finally, the extent of mindfulness self-practice and executive functioning skills will be assessed as mediators of intervention outcomes. RESULTS: This study began screening and recruitment in December 2022. Data collection from the first cohort occurred in January 2023. By November 2023, a total of 30 participants were enrolled out of 224 who received screening. Data analysis began in February 2024, with an approximate publication of results by August 2024. Institutional review board approval took place on September 11, 2019. CONCLUSIONS: This trial will contribute to examining mindfulness-based interventions, delivered via the web, for improving current, residual, or chronic depression symptoms. It will (1) address the feasibility of MBCT delivered via the web; (2) contribute evidence regarding MBCT's efficacy in reducing depression symptoms and psychiatric distress; and (3) assess the impact of MBCT on several important secondary outcomes. Findings from this study will develop the understanding of the causal pathways between MBCT delivered via the web and depression symptoms further, elucidating the potential for future larger-scale designs.

METHODS: In this study, 80 patients suffering from FD in an outpatient clinic were enrolled from January to December 2020. Patients were randomly allocated into the control group (conventional treatment) and observation group (MBCT treatment). Patients in the control group were prescribed rabeprazole and mosapiride, and patients in the observation group were given MBCT therapy in addition to the above drugs. After treatment for 8 weeks, the changes in gastrointestinal symptom scores, anxiety, depression, mindfulness and sleep quality and gastric emptying testing were compared between these two groups. RESULTS: The observation group showed strikingly lower gastrointestinal symptom scores, SAS, SDS, PSQI, and SCL-90 scale scores, and higher FFMQ scale scores than the control group (p < 0.05). There was no conspicuous change in gastric emptying monitoring (p > 0.05).

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence supports mindfulness as a potential psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Individuals with subthreshold PTSD experience significant impairment in their daily life and functioning due to PTSD symptoms, despite not meeting the full diagnostic criteria for PTSD in DSM-5. Mindfulness skills, including non-judgmental acceptance, attentional control and openness to experiences may help alleviate PTSD symptoms by targeting characteristics such as intensified memory processing, dysregulated hyperarousal, avoidance, and thought suppression. This trial aims to test the effects of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) when compared to an active control. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: This 1:1 randomised controlled trial will enroll 160 participants with PTSD symptoms in 2 arms (MBCT vs. Seeking Safety), with both interventions consisting of 8 weekly sessions lasting 2 h each week and led by certified instructors. Assessments will be conducted at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), and 3 months post-intervention (T2), with the primary outcome being PTSD symptoms measured by the PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) at T1. Secondary outcomes include depression, anxiety, attention, experimental avoidance, rumination, mindfulness, and coping skills. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be performed. Mediation analysis will investigate whether attention, experimental avoidance, and rumination mediate the effect of mindfulness on PTSD symptoms. DISCUSSION: The proposed study will assess the effectiveness of MBCT in improving PTSD symptoms. The findings are anticipated to have implications for various areas of healthcare and contribute to the enhancement of existing intervention guidelines for PTSD.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the efficacy of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in alleviating depression in older adults. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in 4 electronic databases and 1 registered database from inception up to July 2021 to identify relevant trials. The meta-analysis employed Hedge's g, along with its 95% CI, and associated z and P-values for the included studies, utilizing Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. RESULTS: Qualitative synthesis was performed on 5 eligible studies. Evaluation of methodological quality and bias risk across the papers involved scrutiny of key variables due to the heterogeneous research formats. Our findings indicated a significant moderating effect of MBCT against current depressive symptoms in older adults (g = 0.53, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) = 0.31-0.75) and a similar effect size for anxiety (g = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.20-0.65). However, caution is warranted due to the limited number of studies and potential publication bias. Further extensive research with longer follow-up measures and larger sample sizes is essential. CONCLUSION: This study underscores the effectiveness of MBCT as a treatment for anxiety and despair in older individuals. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy should be recommended for its positive impact on older adults with depression, and the involvement of authorized psychiatric nurses is crucial for conducting successful MBCT interventions. However, caution is warranted due to the limited number of studies and potential publication bias. Further extensive research with longer follow-up measures and larger sample sizes is essential."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During the period from pregnancy through the first year postpartum, vulnerable individuals are at elevated risk for the onset or worsening of psychological distress, and accessible (e.g., virtually delivered) mental health interventions are needed. Research suggests that Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) can effectively mitigate psychological distress, although few studies have evaluated MBCT in the perinatal period, and samples have been clinically homogenous. Thus, we have designed and are conducting a pilot trial of virtually delivered MBCT with pregnant individuals experiencing a range of psychological symptoms to assess its feasibility and preliminarily explore its effectiveness. Here, we present the study protocol. METHODS: Eligible participants (target N = 70) are ≥18 years with pregnancies between 12 and 30 weeks of gestation. Participants complete a diagnostic interview, self-report symptom ratings, and a computerized cognitive battery assessing self-regulation at the baseline. Participants are then randomized to either MBCT or care as usual. The MBCT intervention involves eight weekly group sessions delivered virtually, with each session focusing on a mindfulness practice followed by group discussion and skill development. Participants in the intervention group are also encouraged to practice mindfulness skills between sessions. Participants in the control condition are provided with information about mindfulness and treatment resources. Baseline measures are repeated following the eight-week intervention period and at three months postpartum. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of virtually delivered MBCT and explore group differences in psychological symptoms during the perinatal period, and will lay the foundation for a larger clinical trial focused on optimizing this intervention to improve psychological functioning among diverse pregnant individuals.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify moderators of treatment effect (i.e. depressive symptoms and well-being) of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Positive Psychology Intervention (PPI) in patients with bipolar disorder. METHODS: Data were drawn from two multicenter randomized controlled trials investigating effectiveness of MBCT vs treatment as usual (TAU; n = 144) and PPI vs TAU (n = 97) in bipolar disorder. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, posttreatment, and 12 months after baseline. Data were analyzed using separate linear regression models, comparing the pooled MBCT or PPI outcomes to TAU, and comparing MBCT to PPI. RESULTS: The exploratory analyses not corrected for multiple comparisons showed a number of variables that were associated with stronger response to the interventions, including higher baseline anxiety, lower well-being, and lower levels of self-focused positive rumination, well-being, and self-compassion, and variables associated with a stronger response to either MBCT (higher levels of depression and anxiety and being married) or PPI (being male). After correcting for multiple testing, depressive symptoms appeared to be the most robust variable associated with better response to MBCT than PPI. LIMITATIONS: The RCTs handled slightly different enrollment criteria and outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: The most robust finding is that patients with more severe symptomatology seem to benefit more from MBCT than PPI. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This is a first step to improve personalized assignment of third-wave CBT interventions for patients with bipolar disorder. However, before definite treatment assignment criteria can be formulated and implemented in clinical practice, these findings should be replicated.",

To identify potential predictive and response biomarkers, this study examines the relationship between clinical domains and resting-state network connectivity in OCD patients undergoing a 3-month MBCT programme. Twelve OCD patients underwent two resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions at baseline and after the MBCT programme. We assessed four clinical domains: positive affect, negative affect, anxiety sensitivity, and rumination. Independent component analysis characterised resting-state networks (RSNs), and multiple regression analyses evaluated brain-clinical associations. At baseline, distinct network connectivity patterns were found for each clinical domain: parietal-subcortical, lateral prefrontal, medial prefrontal, and frontal-occipital. Predictive and response biomarkers revealed significant brain-clinical associations within two main RSNs: the ventral default mode network (vDMN) and the frontostriatal network (FSN). Key brain nodes -the precuneus and the frontopolar cortex- were identified within these networks. MBCT may modulate vDMN and FSN connectivity in OCD patients, possibly reducing symptoms across clinical domains. Each clinical domain had a unique baseline brain connectivity pattern, suggesting potential symptom-based biomarkers. Using these RSNs as predictors could enable personalised treatments and the identification of patients who would benefit most from MBCT.",

Mindfulness-based treatments improve low sexual desire and arousal and associated distress. One theorized mechanism of change is the cultivation of increased mind-body awareness via greater concordance between psychological and physiological components of sexual response. We examined sexual psychophysiology data from 148 cisgender women randomized to receive mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MCBT: n = 70) or supportive sex education (STEP: n = 78) over eight weekly group sessions. Women completed in-lab assessments of subjective, affective, and genital sexual responses to an erotic film pre- and post-treatment, and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Both groups showed positive changes in sexual and affective responses, but these were generally more pronounced for MBCT. MCBT increased sexual concordance to a greater degree, and gains in sexual concordance predicted improvements in sexual distress throughout treatment."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People with schizophrenia often face challenges such as lower psychological resilience, reduced self-worth, and increased social stigma, hindering their recovery. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has shown promise in boosting psychological resilience and self-esteem while diminishing stigma. However, MBCT demands professional involvement and substantial expenses, adding to the workload of professionals and the financial strain on patients. Mixed-mode Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (M-MBCT) integrates both \"face-to-face\" and \"self-help\" approaches to minimize staff effort and costs. This study aims to assess the impact of M-MBCT on the psychological resilience, self-esteem, and stigma in schizophrenia patients. METHODS: This randomized, controlled, parallel-group, assessor-blinded clinical trial enrolled 174 inpatients with schizophrenia. Participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. The experimental group underwent an 8-week M-MBCT intervention, while the control group received standard treatment. Data collection employed the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale (ISMI), and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) before and after the intervention. Post-intervention, significant differences in ISMI, CD-RISC, and RSES scores were observed between the experimental and control groups. RESULTS: In the experimental group, ISMI scores notably decreased, while CD-RISC and RSES scores significantly increased (P < 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis identified age, education, and family history of mental illness as significant factors related to stigma (P < 0.05). Additionally, correlation analysis indicated a significant negative relationship between the reduction in CD-RISC scores and the reduction in ISMI scores (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: M-MBCT effectively enhanced psychological resilience and self-esteem while diminishing stigma in individuals with schizophrenia. M-MBCT emerges as a promising treatment option for schizophrenia sufferers. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on 03/06/2023 ( www.chictr.org.cn ; ChiCTR ID: ChiCTR2300069071).",

      "abstract": "Migraine is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Third wave therapies, such as Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy for Migraine (MBCT-M), have proven efficacious in reducing headache-related disability. However, research is needed to better understand the change mechanisms involved in these third-wave therapies. Acceptance is a fundamental component of third wave therapies, and more research is warranted on the role of pain acceptance in MBCT-M. It is also valuable to understand the independent roles of the two components of pain acceptance-pain willingness (PW) and activity engagement (AE). The current study is a secondary analysis of a randomized control trial of MBCT-M. Sixty participants were included in the study (MBCT = 31; WL/TAU = 29). Baseline correlations between overall pain acceptance, PW, AE, and headache-related disability were run. Mixed models assessed change from baseline to one-month post-treatment and treatment-by-time interaction for overall pain acceptance, PW, and AE. Mixed models also assessed maintenance of changes at 6-month follow-up in the MBCT-M group. Longitudinal mediation models assessed whether change in pain acceptance, PW, and AE mediated the relationship between treatment and change in headache-related disability. Pain acceptance, PW, and AE were all negatively correlated with headache-related disability at baseline. Pain acceptance, PW, and AE all significantly increased over time in both the waitlist/ treatment-as-usual group (WL/TAU) and the MBCT-M group. Only AE increased more in the MBCT group than the WL/TAU group. Change in pain acceptance, PW, and AE all significantly mediated the relationship between MBCT and change in headache-related disability. The study supports the importance of pain acceptance, specifically the activity engagement component, in MBCT-M.",

METHODS: One hundred sixteen SSD patients who had participated in an MBCT program and completed ≥4 intervention sessions were included in a retrospective study (76.7% women, mean age = 40.0, SD = 9.5). Psychometric measures of psychosomatic symptom distress [Brief Symptom Inventory-18 Global Severity Index (BSI-GSI)], self-compassion [Self-Compassion Scale (SCS)], and alexithymia [Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS)] were collected upon admission to the MBCT program and at 6-month follow-up following treatment inclusion. RESULTS: Serial mediation analysis (MBCT→ΔSCS→ΔTAS→ΔBSI-GSI) suggested that changes in both self-compassion and alexithymia had significant indirect effects on improvement in psychosomatic distress [ΔSCS β = -1.810, 95% bootstrap CI (-2.488, -1.160); ΔTAS β = -1.615, bootstrap 95% CI (-2.413, -0.896); ΔSCS→ΔTAS β = -0.621, bootstrap CI (-1.032, -0.315)]. Furthermore, a post-hoc analysis with a reverse sequence (MBCT→ΔTAS→ΔSCS→ΔBSI-GSI) revealed that reduction in alexithymia improved psychosomatic distress and that an increase in self-compassion was a subsequent outcome of alleviation of alexithymia [ΔTAS β = -2.235, bootstrap 95% CI (-3.305, -1.270); ΔSCS β = 0.013, 95% bootstrap CI (-0.600, 0.682); ΔTAS→ΔSCS β = -1.823, bootstrap CI (-2.770, -1.047)]. CONCLUSION: Both alleviation of alexithymia and improvement in self-compassion play a mediating role in the reduction of psychosomatic distress in SSD patients following an MBCT program. Improvement in self-compassion might be a subsequent outcome of MBCT-related alleviation of alexithymia."

This article compares mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), developed for relapse prevention in depression, and mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior therapy (MiCBT), developed for transdiagnostic applications, on: (1) origins, context and theoretical rationale (why), (2) program structure, practice and, professional training (how), and (3) evidence (what). While both approaches incorporate behavior change methods, MBCT encourages behavioral activation, whereas MiCBT includes various exposure procedures to reduce avoidance, including a protocol to practice equanimity during problematic interpersonal interactions, and a compassion training to prevent relapse. MBCT has a substantial research base, including multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses. It is an endorsed preventative treatment for depressive relapse in several clinical guidelines, but its single disorder approach might be regarded as a limitation in many health service settings. MiCBT has a promising evidence base and potential to make a valuable contribution to psychological treatment through its transdiagnostic applicability but has not yet been considered in clinical guidelines. While greater attention to later stage dissemination and implementation research is recommended for MBCT, more high quality RCTs and systematic reviews are needed to develop the evidence base for MiCBT."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Online mindfulness based cognitive therapy (eMBCT) has been shown to reduce psychological distress in people with cancer. However, this population has reported lack of support and asynchronous communication as barriers to eMBCT, resulting in higher nonadherence rates than with face-to-face MBCT. Using a co-creation process, we developed 2 formats of eMBCT: group, blended (combination of therapist-guided group and individual online sessions) and individual, unguided (individual, unguided online sessions only). Group, blended eMBCT offers peer support and guidance, whereas individual, unguided eMBCT offers flexibility and the possibility of large-scale implementation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this nonrandomized feasibility study was to assess aspects of feasibility of the group, blended and individual, unguided eMBCT interventions. METHODS: Participants were people with cancer who chose between group, blended and individual, unguided eMBCT. Both intervention conditions followed the same 8-week eMBCT program, including an introductory session and a silent day (10 sessions total). All sessions for individual, unguided eMBCT occurred via the platform Minddistrict, whereas group, blended eMBCT consisted of 3 online videoconference sessions guided by a mindfulness teacher and 5 sessions via Minddistrict. We assessed the feasibility of the intervention quantitatively and qualitatively by evaluating its acceptability among participants. Additionally, we assessed limited efficacy by looking at the number of questionnaires participants completed pre- and postintervention. RESULTS: We included 12 participants for each eMBCT condition. Participants in group, blended eMBCT completed, on average, 9.7 of 10 sessions, compared with an average 8.3 sessions for individual, unguided eMBCT (excluding dropouts). Of the 24 participants, 13 (54%) agreed to be interviewed (5 unguided and 8 blended). Participants in both conditions reported positive experiences, including the convenience of not having to travel and the flexibility to choose when and where to participate. However, among the barriers for participation, participants in the group, blended condition reported a preference for more group sessions, and participants in the individual, unguided condition reported a lack of guidance. Additionally, for the group, blended condition, the effect sizes were small for all outcome measures (Hedges g range=0.01-0.36), except for fatigue, which had a moderate effect size (Hedges g=0.57). For the individual, unguided condition, the effect sizes were small for all outcome measures (Hedges g range=0.24-0.46), except for mindfulness skills (Hedges g=0.52) and engagement with the intervention (Hedges g=1.53). CONCLUSIONS: Participants in this study had a positive experience with group, blended and individual, unguided eMBCT. Based on the results from this study, we will adjust the intervention prior to conducting a full-scale randomized controlled trial to evaluate effectiveness; we will add 1 group session to the group, blended eMBCT using Zoom as the platform for the group sessions; and we will send reminders to participants to complete questionnaires.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been documented to be effective in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, the neurobiological basis of MBCT remains largely elusive, which makes it clinically challenging to predict which patients are more likely to respond poorly. Hence, identifying biomarkers for predicting treatment outcomes holds both scientific and clinical values. This prognostic study aims to investigate whether pre-treatment brain morphological metrics can predict the effectiveness of MBCT, compared with psycho-education (PE) as an active placebo, among patients with OCD. METHODS: A total of 32 patients with OCD were included in this prognostic study. They received magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans before treatment. Subsequently, 16 patients received 10 weeks of MBCT, while the other 16 patients underwent a 10-week PE program. The effectiveness of the treatments was primarily assessed by the reduction rate of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) total score before and after the treatment. We investigated whether several predefined OCD-associated brain morphological metrics, selected based on prior published studies by the ENIGMA Consortium, could predict the treatment effectiveness. RESULTS: Both the MBCT and PE groups exhibited substantial reductions in Y-BOCS scores over 10 weeks of treatment, with the MBCT group showing a larger reduction. Notably, the pallidum total volume was associated with treatment effectiveness, irrespective of the intervention group. Specifically, a linear regression model utilizing the pre-treatment pallidum volume to predict the treatment effectiveness suggested that a one-cubic-centimeter increase in pallidum volume corresponded to a 22.3% decrease in the Y-BOCS total score reduction rate. CONCLUSIONS: Pallidum volume may serve as a promising predictor for the effectiveness of MBCT and PE, and perhaps, other treatments with the shared mechanisms by MBCT and PE, among patients with OCD.",

The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of dry cupping and counselling with the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) approach on fertility QoL and conception success in infertile women due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). METHODS: This was a two-arm pilot randomized clinical trial from first January 2021 to the end of November 2022. In this regard, 19 women with infertility who were referred to the health centers affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences and met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. Participants were randomly divided into two groups (10 in the virtual MBCT group and 9 in the cupping group). All participants completed the fertility quality of life (FertiQol) tool before the intervention and three months after the end of the intervention. In addition, after the end of the intervention, a human chorionic gonadotropin test was performed monthly for three months, too. We used ANOVA/ANCOVA and its related effect sizes, including mean difference (MD) and standard mean difference (SMD: Hedges's g), and chi-square tests to compare the study group outcomes in Stata 14.2. P-values equal to or less than 0.10 were considered significant. RESULTS: The intervention resulted in significant differences in the mean overall scores of FertiQol between the counseling and cupping groups (61.76±14.28 and 50.65±12.53, respectively) [P=0.091, MD=11.11 (90% CI: 0.33 to 21.89), SMD=1.07 (90% CI: 0.279 to 1.84)]. No significant difference was found in conception rates between the groups after the intervention. CONCLUSION: This pilot study found that MBCT improved the fertility QoL in PCOS-related infertility patients better than cupping therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: IRCT201706110334452N1.",

      "abstract": "AIM: Mindfulness-based interventions have been tested as preventive programs for childhood internalizing difficulties, but most research has been at a 'universal' level with small to null effects. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children (MBCT-C) has similar effects to Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) when used as a small-group, targeted preventive program. Knowledge gaps include the longer-term effectiveness of MBCT-C relative to CBT and the benefits of adding a parent module. This trial aims to compare MCBT-C to traditional CBT, including a parent module, to 15-months post-intervention and to test the feasibility and acceptability of adding a parent module. METHODS: Participants will be recruited from primary schools in areas of socio-economic disadvantage in South Australia (n = 194). Children (aged 9-12) years with signs of internalizing difficulties (e.g., shy, withdrawn, worried), and their parents, will be eligible for this two-armed randomized controlled non-inferiority trial (RCT). Children will participate in 10 group sessions of MBCT-C or CBT, facilitated by psychologists, and parents from both conditions will participate in two parent-only group sessions. Child self-report measures include depression and anxiety, as well as attention, mindfulness and self-compassion. Parent measures include symptoms of depression and anxiety, mindfulness, and parent-child relationship strength. The primary outcome will be child anxiety and depression (Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale-25). Measures will be collected pre and post intervention, and at 3, 6, 12 and 15-month follow up. RESULTS: Schools will be recruited from October 2022. Nomination of children will commence from February 2023. Program implementation will begin May 2023. CONCLUSIONS: This trial will have implications for the feasibility of involving parents in preventative programs, as well as whether mindfulness-based interventions prevent internalizing difficulties over time.",

METHODS: Sixty-eight remitted participants with at least three prior episodes of depression were randomized to 8 weeks of MBCT (n = 33) or a waitlist control condition (n = 35). The Bergen Insomnia Scale was used to screen for insomnia symptoms before and after the intervention. The analyses were conducted using one-way between-groups analyses of covariance. RESULTS: Twenty-five MBCT participants and 30 waitlist controls completed the study (74.5% females; mean age 40.7 ± 12.9 years). At baseline, 83.6% screened positive for the insomnia diagnosis. Following the intervention and after controlling for corresponding insomnia parameters at baseline, MBCT completers reported significantly less severe insomnia symptoms (p = 0.017), as well as less problems with prolonged sleep onset (p = 0.047) and nocturnal awakenings (p = 0.023), relative to controls. No group differences were found on early morning awakening, daytime impairment, or dissatisfaction with sleep. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that MBCT improves certain insomnia symptoms. However, additional sleep-specific interventions may be needed to further improve this population's sleep.Clinical Trial Registration: ISRCTN, ISRCTN18001392, registered 22/11/2018.

The present study followed the schedule and content of Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), and only changed the treatment format (from offline to online) to investigate the effectiveness of online group MBCT for Chinese outpatients with depression. METHODS: The study used before-and-after controlled design, and included 88 depressed outpatients, of which 75 formally underwent a 10-week online group MBCT. The 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-24), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Self-Depression Rating Scale (SDS), Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), and Self-Acceptance Questionnaire (SAQ) were administered to patients one week prior to treatment, the fifth week of treatment, and the tenth week of treatment. Repeated-measures data were processed using linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: 75 patients (85.23 %) attended >4 sessions, 44 of whom were taking psychotropic medication during treatment. HAMD-24 and HAMA scores decreased significantly in both medicated and unmedicated patients (w10 < w1, p < 0.05). HAMD-24 and HAMA scores declined more rapidly in patients taking medication, with significant decreases in the fifth week (w5 < w1, p < 0.05). The remarkable effectiveness of treatment (HAMD-24 score reduction >50 %) was >30 %, but there were no significant changes in patients' SDS, MAAS, or SAQ scores. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the effectiveness of online group MBCT for outpatients with depression and the adherence of depressed patients to participate in online group MBCT was high.",

This study aims to evaluate the impact of MBCT adjunctive treatment on these variables. Main hypothesis was that MBCT would improve cognitive functioning and BDNF more than Psychoeducation and TAU. METHODS: Randomized, multicenter, prospective and single-blinded trial. Included BD outpatients randomly assigned to three treatment arms: MBCT plus treatment as usual (TAU), Psychoeducation plus Tau and TAU. Cognitive functions were assessed with Continuous Performance Test-III, Stroop Test, Trail Making Test, Digit Span and Letter-Number Sequencing from Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III, Face Emotion Identification Task and Face Emotion Discrimination Task. BDNF serum level was measured with ELISA. Patients were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks and 6 months. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients were recruited (TAU = 10, Psychoeducation = 34, MBCT = 40). No significant differences between treatment groups were found. MBCT does not achieve better results than Psychoeducation or TAU. DISCUSSION: Being Psychoeducation and TAU efficient interventions, as well as the scarce duration of a more complex intervention, such as MBCT, are suggested as explanatory variables of these results.

METHOD: This randomized controlled trial was performed with 120 liver transplant recipients hospitalized at the liver transplant department of a research and practice hospital (n = 120). While we administered no intervention to the patients in the control group (n = 60), we provided Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy to those in the experimental group (n = 60). We used the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale and the Immunosuppressant Therapy Adherence Scale to collect data. We utilized descriptive statistics, paired-samples t-tests, independent-samples t-tests, one-way analysis of variance, and chi-squared tests to analyze the data. RESULTS: After the intervention, the immunosuppressive therapy adherence levels of the experimental group increased significantly (p < 0.01). On the other hand, the control group had significantly higher adherence to immunosuppressive therapy and significantly higher levels of mindfulness in the pretest phase than it did in the posttest phase (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Complete adherence to immunosuppressive therapy is imperative for the prevention of graft rejection in liver transplant recipients. In our study, the experimental group equipped with enhanced mindfulness had higher adherence to immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, the use of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy in the promotion of adherence to immunosuppressive therapy is recommended.",

MBCT-TiF sits within a global mental health approach, which aims to help shift a wider distribution of the population towards mental well-being and away from mental ill health using a family of MBCT curricula. The primary hypothesis was that MBCT-TiF, compared to Ongoing Mindfulness Practice (OMP), would help MBCT/MBSR graduates improve their mental well-being. METHOD: A parallel RCT with repeated measures was conducted. 164 graduates of MBCT/MBSR were randomly assigned (1:1) to either MBCT-TiF or OMP. REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05154266). RESULTS: Of the 164 graduates recruited, 83 were randomly assigned to MBCT-TiF and 81 to OMP. MBCT-TiF was significantly more effective than OMP at improving mental well-being, with large effects post-intervention (B = 6.25; 95% CI = [4.20, 8.29]; Cohen's d = 0.78). No serious adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support MBCT-TiF, in the context of the proposed global mental health approach, to help MBCT/MBSR graduates sustain mental health benefits and experience further gains in mental well-being after completing an introductory MBCT/MBSR programme.

METHODS: This study was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews And Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The search was conducted during May and June 2023 using four databases: Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL. Different keywords combined with Boolean operators were used. Only 10 articles of the initial 177 were included. In the study, the standardized mean difference (SMD) was used along with a 95% confidence interval to measure the effect. Heterogeneity among the studies, assessed using Cochran's Q-test and the I2 statistic was found to be low, leading to the use of a fixed-effects model in the analysis. The effect size was expressed as Hedge'g. Furthermore, a subgroup analysis was conducted, taking into account the various tools used to assess sleep conditions. RESULTS: Mindfulness was found to reduce poor sleep quality in people with both long-term and short-term sleep disorders. Weighting effect model Hedge'g = -0.344 with a 95% confidence interval ranging from -0.425 to -0.263. In all cases, statistically significant results were observed, as well as moderate and negative effect sizes according to the Hedge's g index: -0.326 for Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), -0.343 for Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and -0.28 for Sleep Onset Latency (SOL). CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that mindfulness can be used to remedy poor sleep quality in older people, so it could be a viable treatment option for insomnia or other problems related to poor sleep quality in this population.",

METHODS: For this randomized controlled study, 97 patients were randomly assigned to either the MBCT-SH (n = 48) or control (n = 49) group. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-24), and Suicide Attitude Questionnaire (SAQ) were used to assess mindfulness, depression symptoms, and suicidal ideation, respectively, at baseline (T0), intervention week 4 (T1), intervention week 8 (T2), and 3-month follow-up (T3). The groups were also compared on treatment costs and readmission rates at a 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: In the MBCT-SH group, 46 of 48 participants (96%) completed the eight-week program. At T0, there were no statistically significant between-group differences in demographics, clinical characteristics, FFMQ, HAMD-24, or SAQ. Nor were there statistically significant differences on the HAMD-24 or SAQ between the MBCT-SH and control groups at T1 (p = 0.18 and p = 0.59, respectively), while mindfulness was significantly higher in the MBCT-SH group (t = 2.383, p = 0.019). At T2, there were significant between-group differences on the FFMQ, HAMD-24, and SAQ, all of which remained significant at T3. At the 6-month follow-up, per capita treatment costs were 5,298 RMB lower in the MBCT-SH group compared with the control group, while their readmission rates (6.1% and 4.2%, respectively) did not differ significantly.

      "abstract": "To examine the dose-response effect of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for college students with major depressive disorder (MDD), a randomized control trial with MBCT and a wait-list (WL) group was performed. All participants were invited to self-administer a set of questionnaires at baseline, mid-intervention (4th week), and post-intervention (8th week) by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS). The serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, BDNF were detected at baseline and post-intervention. After intervention, the scores of PHQ-9, GAD-7, PSQI, and the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α in the MBCT were significantly lower than those in WL group, and total scores of FFMQ, SCS, and the level of BDNF were significantly higher than those in WL group. In MBCT group, daily practice time and session numbers positively related to reduction rates of PHQ-9, GAD-7 and PSQI at post-intervention. The reduction rate of PHQ-9, GAD-7 and PSQI at post-intervention in the completers were higher significantly than those in the partial attendees. These findings suggested MBCT is effective for MDD, and the intervention has a dose-response effect. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registration number is [ChiCTR2100044309].",

The present study aims to investigate the effectiveness of MBCT adapted to individuals who are suicidal (MBCT-S) in a randomized controlled trial, comparing an intervention group receiving MBCT-S and treatment as usual (TAU) with a control group receiving TAU only. Participants who were 18 years or older and experienced suicidal ideation were included. Assessments on suicidal ideation and symptoms associated with suicidal behavior were carried out at baseline, post-treatment, and 12 weeks after the end of the training. When comparing the intervention group with the control group, a significant reduction was found at follow-up in suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms. When focusing on the intervention group only, a significant reduction was found in suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, hopelessness, worrying, defeat, and entrapment, and a significant increase in mindfulness both at post-treatment and at follow-up. The findings suggest that MBCT-S is a promising suicide-specific intervention as it may have the potential to reduce suicidal ideation and suicide-related components.",

We hypothesized that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, customized for visual symptoms (MBCT-vision), can treat VSS and modulate dysfunctional VNs. METHODS: An open-label feasibility study for an 8-week MBCT-vision treatment program was conducted. Primary (symptom severity; impact on daily life) and secondary (WHO-5; CORE-10) outcomes at Week 9 and Week 20 were compared with baseline. Secondary MRI outcomes in a subcohort compared resting-state functional and diffusion MRI between baseline and Week 20. RESULTS: Twenty-one participants (14 male participants, median 30 years, range 22-56 years) recruited from January 2020 to October 2021. Two (9.5%) dropped out. Self-rated symptom severity (0-10) improved: baseline (median [interquartile range (IQR)] 7 [6-8]) vs Week 9 (5.5 [3-7], P = 0.015) and Week 20 (4 [3-6], P < 0.001), respectively. Self-rated impact of symptoms on daily life (0-10) improved: baseline (6 [5-8]) vs Week 9 (4 [2-5], P = 0.003) and Week 20 (2 [1-3], P < 0.001), respectively. WHO-5 Wellbeing (0-100) improved: baseline (median [IQR] 52 [36-56]) vs Week 9 (median 64 [47-80], P = 0.001) and Week 20 (68 [48-76], P < 0.001), respectively. CORE-10 Distress (0-40) improved: baseline (15 [12-20]) vs Week 9 (12.5 [11-16.5], P = 0.003) and Week 20 (11 [10-14], P = 0.003), respectively. Within-subject fMRI analysis found reductions between baseline and Week 20, within VN-related FC in the i) left lateral occipital cortex (size = 82 mL, familywise error [FWE]-corrected P value = 0.006) and ii) left cerebellar lobules VIIb/VIII (size = 65 mL, FWE-corrected P value = 0.02), and increases within VN-related FC in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (size = 69 mL, cluster-level FWE-corrected P value = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: MBCT-vision was a feasible treatment for VSS, improved symptoms and modulated FC of VNs. This study also showed proof-of-concept for intensive mindfulness interventions in the treatment of neurological conditions.",

METHOD: A secondary analysis of an RCT using simple mediation, with 164 graduates of MBCT and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), was implemented whereby MBCT-TiF (vs ongoing mindfulness practice; OMP) was the independent variable; changes in mindfulness, self-compassion, and decentering during the intervention were the mediators; and mental well-being at post-intervention, whilst controlling for baseline, was the dependent variable. Secondary outcomes included psychological quality of life, depression, and anxiety. RESULTS: Compared to OMP, MBCT-TiF experienced significant improvements in mental well-being through changes in all three mediators (mindfulness: ab = 0.11 [0.03, 0.25]; decentering: ab = 0.16 [0.05, 0.33]; self-compassion: ab = 0.07 [0.01, 0.18]). A similar pattern was demonstrated for depression, but only mindfulness and decentering mediated effects on psychological quality of life and anxiety. CONCLUSION: The findings provide preliminary support for all three mediators in driving change in mental well-being in a sample of MBCT/MBSR graduates. Future work must be theory-driven and powered to test all mediators in parallel and alongside other potential mediators (e.g., equanimity) to further understand independent contributions and interacting effects.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05154266.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic fatigue is a common symptom among patients who have been treated for cancer. Current psychosocial interventions typically target the patient alone, despite growing evidence suggesting that a couples' approach can increase and broaden the efficacy of an intervention. Therefore, based on an existing web-based mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for patients, the couple intervention COMPANION was developed. OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives of this study are to determine the acceptability of COMPANION and its potential efficacy in reducing fatigue in patients with cancer. Our secondary objectives are to examine the feasibility of the trial procedures and the potential working mechanisms of the couple intervention. METHODS: We will conduct a single-arm pilot trial for couples (ie, patients with cancer with chronic fatigue and their partners). All couples are allocated to the web-based couple intervention that consists of psychoeducation, mindfulness, and cognitive-behavioral exercises. The 9 sessions of the intervention are supervised remotely by a trained therapist. Patients and partners will complete questionnaires before starting the intervention (T0), 2 weeks after completing the intervention (T1), and 1 month after T1 (T2). They will also fill out weekly diaries during the intervention period. A subsample of patients (n≈5) and partners (n≈5) as well as all the therapists providing COMPANION will participate in the final focus groups. Benchmark values have been defined to determine the acceptability (ie, ≥60% of couples complete the intervention and/or ≥70% of the participants are satisfied with the intervention) and potential efficacy (ie, a significant improvement in fatigue and/or a clinically relevant improvement in fatigue in 45% of the patients between T0 and T1) of the intervention. The trial procedures are deemed feasible if an average of at least three couples are included per recruiting month and/or adherence to the assessments is at least 65% for T1 and the diaries and 60% for T2. To establish potential working mechanisms, changes in affect, sleep, catastrophizing, partner communication and interactions, self-efficacy, mindfulness, and closeness will be examined. Quantitative outcomes will be interpreted along with the results from the focus groups. RESULTS: Data collection is expected to be completed by March 2024. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial will test the first web-based mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for couples targeting chronic cancer-related fatigue. Findings will indicate whether proceeding with a randomized controlled trial is warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05636696; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05636696.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Around 40-50% of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) suffer from obsessions and compulsions after receiving first-line treatments. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been proposed as a reasonable augmentation strategy for OCD. MBCT trains to decentre from distressful thoughts and emotions by focusing on them voluntarily and with consciousness. This practice develops alternative ways to deal with obsessions, which could increase non-reactivity behaviours and, in turn, reduce compulsions. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of MBCT to improve OCD symptoms. Secondly, it pursues to investigate which socio-demographic, clinical, and neurobiological characteristics mediate or moderate the MBCT response; and identify potential biomarkers of positive/negative response. METHODS: This study is a randomised clinical trial (RCT) of 60 OCD patients who do not respond to first-line treatments. Participants will be randomised to either an MBCT program or treatment as usual. The MBCT group will undergo 10 weekly sessions of 120min. Principal outcome: change in OCD severity symptoms using clinician and self-reported measures. Also, participants will undergo a comprehensive evaluation assessing comorbid clinical variables, neuropsychological functioning and thought content. Finally, a comprehensive neuroimaging protocol using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging will be acquired in a 3T scanner. All data will be obtained at baseline and post-intervention. DISCUSSION: This study will assess the efficacy of mindfulness in OCD patients who do not achieve clinical recovery after usual treatment. It is the first RCT in this subject examining clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging variables to examine the neural patterns associated with the MBCT response.

METHOD: One hundred sixty adults self-selected from the general population were randomized to one of four mindfulness practices: body scan, mindful movement, breath and body, and befriending. Study 1 explored state-level self-compassion, mindfulness, decentering (mechanisms), and pleasantness of thoughts, emotions, and body sensations at multiple time points using two single mindfulness sessions. Study 2 explored trait-level self-compassion, mindfulness, decentering, interoceptive awareness, attentional control (mechanisms), anxiety, depression, and psychological quality of life pre-post 2 weeks of daily practice. RESULTS: In study 1, state-level effects were demonstrated in all candidate mechanisms and outcomes within the whole sample across time points (d = 0.27 to 0.86), except for state decentering. After controlling for pre-scores and additional covariates, no between-group effects were found (p = 0.050 to 0.973). In study 2, trait-level effects were demonstrated in psychological quality of life and most candidate mechanisms within the whole sample (d = 0.26 to 0.64) but no between-group effects were found (p = 0.080 to 0.805). Within the whole sample, after controlling for pre-scores, changes in mindfulness, self-compassion, decentering, and interoceptive awareness (i.e. body listening) were associated with improvements in psychological quality of life (r = 0.23 to 0.40) and self-led mindfulness practice (r = 0.18 to 0.23).

The purpose of this multicentre, evaluator blinded RCT was to investigate the added value of MBCT to treatment as usual (TAU) in BD up to 15 months follow-up (NCT03507647). METHODS: A total of 144 participants with BD type I and II were randomised to MBCT + TAU (n = 72) and TAU (n = 72). Primary outcome was current depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes were current (hypo)manic and anxiety symptoms, recurrence rates, rumination, dampening of positive affect, functional impairment, mindfulness skills, self-compassion, and positive mental health. Potential moderators of treatment outcome were examined. RESULTS: MBCT + TAU was not more efficacious than TAU in reducing current depressive symptoms at post-treatment (95% CI [-7.0 to 1.8], p = 0.303, d = 0.24) or follow-up (95% CI [-2.2 to 6.3], p = 0.037, d = 0.13). At post-treatment, MBCT + TAU was more effective than TAU in improving mindfulness skills. At follow-up, TAU was more effective than MBCT + TAU in reducing trait anxiety and improving mindfulness skills and positive mental health. Exploratory analysis revealed that participants with higher depressive symptoms and functional impairment at baseline benefitted more from MBCT + TAU than TAU. CONCLUSIONS: In these participants with highly recurrent BD, MBCT may be a treatment option in addition to TAU for those who suffer from moderate to severe levels of depression and functional impairment.

BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common disabling neurological condition. MBCT-M combines elements of cognitive behavioral therapy with mindfulness-based approaches and has demonstrated efficacy in reducing migraine-related disability. METHODS: A total of 60 adults with migraine completed a 30-day run-in before randomization into a parallel design of either eight weekly individual MBCT-M sessions (n = 31) or waitlist/treatment as usual (n = 29): participants were followed for 1 month after. Participants completed the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire (CFQ) at Months 0, 1, 2, and 4. RESULTS: The PCS scores decreased more in the MBCT-M group (mean [SD] at baseline = 22.5 [9.6]; at Month 4 = 15.1 [8.8]) than in the waitlist/treatment as usual group (mean [SD] at baseline = 24.9 [9.0]; at Month 4 = 22.5 [10.4]) from Month 0 to 4 (β = -7.24, p = 0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI] -11.39 to -3.09). The CFQ (mean [SD] baseline = 27.6 [8.0]; at Month 4 = 25.0 [8.0]) did not change significantly from Month 0 to 4 (β = -1.2, p = 0.482, 95% CI -4.5 to 2.1). Parallel mediation analyses indicated that decreases in the PCS and CFQ together (β = -6.1, SE = 2.5, 95% CI -11.6 to -1.8), and the PCS alone (β = -4.8, SE = 2.04, 95% CI -9.1 to -1.1), mediated changes in headache disability in the MBCT-M treatment completer group (n = 19). CONCLUSION: In this study, pain catastrophizing showed strong promise as a potential mechanism of MBCT-M.

METHODS: An economic evaluation with a time horizon of 15 months was conducted from a societal perspective. Outcomes were expressed in costs per quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs per responder using the inventory of depressive symptomatology clinician rating score. RESULTS: People with BD (N = 144) were included in this study. From a societal perspective, the difference of total costs between MBCT + TAU and TAU was €615, with lower costs in the MBCT + TAU group. Only healthcare costs differed significantly between the two groups. A small difference in QALYs in favor of MBCT + TAU was found combined with lower costs (-€836; baseline adjusted) for MBCT + TAU compared to TAU, resulting in a dominant incremental cost-utility ratio. The probability that the MBCT + TAU was cost-effective was 65%. All sensitivity analyses attested to the robustness of the base case analyses. CONCLUSION: Concludingly, MBCT + TAU seems to be cost-effective compared to TAU alone, indicated by a small or neglectable difference in effect, in favor of MBCT + TAU, while resulting in lower costs."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alopecia areata (AA) is an immunological disorder characterised by hair loss. Individuals with AA report high levels of social anxiety. One intervention that holds potential for reducing social anxiety in individuals with AA is mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). AIMS: Our key aim was to investigate whether MBCT reduces social anxiety in individuals with AA. The study also investigated whether MBCT reduces depression, general anxiety, and increases quality of life and increases trait mindfulness in individuals with AA. METHOD: Five participants with AA took part in an 8-session in-person MBCT intervention. A multiple-baseline single-group case series design was adopted. Idiographic measures of social anxiety were measured each day from baseline, through intervention, to follow-up. Standardised questionnaires of trait mindfulness, social anxiety, depression, anxiety, and quality of life were completed at baseline, post-intervention, and at 4-week follow-up. RESULTS: All participants completed the MBCT course, but one participant was excluded from the idiographic analysis due to a high amount of missing data. The remaining four participants demonstrated reductions in idiographic measures of social anxiety from baseline to follow-up. These effects were larger between baseline and follow-up, than between baseline and post-intervention. Two participants demonstrated significant improvement in standardised measures of wellbeing from baseline to follow-up - they also practised mindfulness most regularly at home between sessions. CONCLUSION: MBCT may be effective in reducing social anxiety and improving wellbeing in individuals with AA, although this might be dependent on the extent to which participants regularly practise mindfulness exercises.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to conduct an economic evaluation of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in healthy participants by performing cost-utility analysis (CUA) and cost-benefit analysis (CBA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: CUA was carried out from a healthcare sector perspective and CBA was from the employer's perspective in parallel with a randomized controlled trial. Of the 90 healthy participants, 50 met the inclusion criteria and were randomized to the MBCT group (n = 25) or wait-list control group (n = 25). In the CUA, intervention costs and healthcare costs were included, while the mean difference in the change in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between the baseline and 16-week follow-up was used as an indicator of effect. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was produced, and uncertainty was addressed using non-parametric bootstrapping with 5000 replications. In the CBA, the change in productivity losses was reflected as a benefit, while the costs included intervention and healthcare costs. The net monetary benefit was calculated, and uncertainty was handled with 5000 bootstrapping. Healthcare costs were measured with the self-report Health Service Use Inventory. The purchasing power parity in 2019 was used for currency conversion. RESULTS: In the CUA, incremental costs and QALYs were estimated at JPY 19,700 (USD 189) and 0.011, respectively. The ICER then became JPY 1,799,435 (USD 17,252). The probability of MBCT being cost-effective was 92.2% at the threshold of 30,000 UK pounds per QALY. The CBA revealed that MBCT resulted in increased costs (JPY 24,180) and improved work productivity (JPY 130,640), with a net monetary benefit of JPY 106,460 (USD 1021). The probability of the net monetary benefit being positive was 69.6%. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that MBCT may be more cost-effective from a healthcare sector perspective and may be cost-beneficial from the employer's perspective."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Digital delivery of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy through the Mindful Mood Balance (MMB) program is clinically effective (Segal et al., 2020); however, the mechanisms through which this program delivers its benefits have not been established. METHOD: This study investigates the differential impact of the MMB program paired with usual depression care (UDC) compared to UDC alone on the putative targets of self-reported mindfulness, decentering, and rumination and the extent to which change in these targets mediates subsequent depressive relapse among a sample of predominantly White, female participants, with residual depressive symptoms. RESULTS: The MMB program relative to UDC was associated with a significantly greater rate of change in decentering (t = 4.94, p < .0001, d = 0.46), mindfulness (t = 6.04, p < .0001, d = 0.56), and rumination (t = 3.82, p < .0001, d = 0.36). Subsequent depressive relapse also was mediated by prior change in these putative targets, with a significant natural indirect effect for decentering, χ2(1) = 7.25, p < .008, OR = 0.57; mindfulness, χ2(1) = 9.99, p < .002, OR = 0.50; and rumination, χ2(1) = 12.95, p < .001, OR = 0.35. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the mechanisms of MMB are consistent with the conceptual model for mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and depressive relapse risk and that such processes can be modified through digital delivery.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Women who have experienced domestic violence and abuse (DVA) are at increased risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD). In 2014-2015, we developed a prototype trauma-specific mindfulness-based cognitive therapy curriculum (TS-MBCT) for the treatment of PTSD in a DVA population. This study aimed to refine the prototype TS-MBCT and evaluate the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) testing its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. METHODS: Intervention refinement phase was informed by evidence synthesis from a literature review, qualitative interviews with professionals and DVA survivors, and a consensus exercise with experts in trauma and mindfulness. We tested the refined TS-MBCT intervention in an individually randomised parallel group feasibility trial with pre-specified progression criteria, a traffic light system, and embedded process and health economics evaluations. RESULTS: The TS-MBCT intervention consisted of eight group sessions and home practice. We screened 109 women in a DVA agency and recruited 20 (15 TS-MBCT, 5 self-referral to National Health Service (NHS) psychological treatment), with 80% follow-up at 6 months. Our TS-MBCT intervention had 73% uptake, 100% retention, and high acceptability. Participants suggested recruitment via multiple agencies, and additional safety measures. Randomisation into the NHS control arm did not work due to long waiting lists and previous negative experiences. Three self-administered PTSD/CPTSD questionnaires produced differing outcomes thus a clinician administered measure might work better. We met six out of nine feasibility progression criteria at green and three at amber targets demonstrating that it is possible to conduct a full-size RCT of the TS-MBCT intervention after making minor amendments to recruitment and randomisation procedures, the control intervention, primary outcomes measures, and intervention content. At 6 months, none of the PTSD/CPTSD outcomes ruled out a clinically important difference between trial arms indicating that it is reasonable to proceed to a full-size RCT to estimate these outcomes with greater precision. CONCLUSIONS: A future RCT of the coMforT TS-MBCT intervention should have an internal pilot, recruit from multiple DVA agencies, NHS and non-NHS settings, have an active control psychological treatment, use robust randomisation and safety procedures, and clinician-administered measures for PTSD/CPTSD.

One hundred and six older adults participated and were assigned to the subclinical insomnia (n = 50) or moderate insomnia (n = 56) groups; subsequently, they were randomly assigned to the control and intervention groups. Subjects were evaluated at two times with the Insomnia Severity Index and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Significant results were obtained on both scales, with a reduction in insomnia symptoms in the subclinical and moderate intervention groups. The administration of a treatment that combines mindfulness and cognitive therapy is effective for treating insomnia in older adults."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) may have positive physiological and psychological benefits for breast cancer survivors. However, few studies involved a combination of the relevant literatures to confirm the effects. METHODS: Our study included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs comparing interventions of MBCT and control protocols for alleviation of symptoms among breast cancer survivors. We calculated pooled mean differences (MDs), standardized mean differences (SMDs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by using random effects models to estimate summary effect sizes. RESULTS: Thirteen trials with 20-245 participants were considered in our studies; for the meta-analysis, 11 of these studies were eligible for assessment. The pooled meta-analysis results revealed that at the end of the MBCT intervention, participants' anxiety (SMD, - 0.70; 95% CI, - 1.26 to - 0.13; I2 = 69%), pain (SMD, - 0.64; 95% CI, - 0.92 to - 0.37; I2 = 0%), and depression (SMD, - 0.65; 95% CI, - 1.14 to - 0.17; I2 = 75%) levels significantly decreased, and their mindfulness (MD, 8.83; 95% CI, 3.88 to 13.78; I2 = 68%) levels significantly increased. CONCLUSION: The MBCT may be associated with improved pain, anxiety, depression, and mindfulness. However, the quantitative analysis pointed to an inconclusive result due to moderate to high levels of heterogeneity among indicator of anxiety, depression, and mindfulness. Future work requires more studies to better elucidate the clinical significance of this possible association. The results suggest that MBCT is highly beneficial as an intervention for patients who have received treatment for breast cancer.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) suffer from psychological distress, fatigue and sleep disturbances, which are associated with reduced quality of life (QoL) and increased societal costs. Only limited psychosocial treatment options are available. As Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has demonstrated to improve psychological distress, QoL and sleep in other populations, MBCT might also be effective in patients with IBD. METHODS: The MindIBD study is a prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled trial comparing MBCT plus Treatment As Usual (TAU) versus TAU alone in a targeted number of 136 IBD patients in remission, aged 16 years and older with at least mild psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) total score ≥ 11). Primary outcome is reduction of psychological distress post-intervention, measured by the HADS. In addition, the effect of MBCT on sleep quality (including actigraphy and electroencephalography recordings), fatigue, disease activity, perceived disease control, QoL and positive mental health will be examined. Assessments will be conducted at baseline and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months follow-up. Cost-effectiveness will be determined and a process evaluation will be conducted. DISCUSSION: This study will provide valuable insight into the clinical effect of MBCT on psychological distress, sleep quality, fatigue and QoL in IBD patients and into the cost-effectiveness. If effective, MBCT can be a valuable addition to the available psychosocial interventions for patients with IBD. Moreover, findings from this study may also be applicable in patients with other chronic conditions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04646785, registered on 30/11/2020.",

RESULTS: Participants who received MBCT showed greater improvement on self-reported and clinician ratings of BDD symptoms, self-reported emotion dysregulation symptoms and executive function compared with TAU participants. Improvement for executive function tasks was partially supported. In addition, feasibility and acceptability of MBCT training were positive.

Although data are limited, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) might be a promising treatment for patients with chronic noncancer pain combined with OUD. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore the feasibility and process of change during MBCT in this particular population. METHODS: In this qualitative pilot study, 21 patients who were hospitalized for rotation to buprenorphine/naloxone as agonist treatment for chronic pain and OUD were offered MBCT. Semistructured interviews were conducted to explore experienced barriers and facilitators to MBCT. Patients who participated in MBCT were also interviewed on their perceived process of change. RESULTS: Of 21 patients invited to participate in MBCT, 12 initially expressed interest but only four eventually participated in MBCT. The timing of the intervention, group format, somatic complaints, and practical difficulties were identified as the main barriers to participation. Facilitating factors included having a positive attribution toward MBCT, an intrinsic motivation to change, and practical support. The four MBCT participants mentioned several important mechanisms of change, including reduction of opioid craving and improved coping with pain. CONCLUSIONS: MBCT offered in the current study was not feasible for the majority of patients with pain and OUD. Changing the timing of MBCT by providing it at an earlier stage of the treatment and offering MBCT in an online format may facilitate participation.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We applied 7 Tesla phase sensitive imaging to evaluate the impact of brain iron levels on depression severity and cognitive function in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) treated with mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). METHODS: Seventeen unmedicated MDD participants underwent MRI, evaluation of depression severity, and cognitive testing before and after receiving MBCT, compared to fourteen healthy controls (HC). Local field shift (LFS) values, measures of brain iron levels, were derived from phase images in the putamen, caudate, globus pallidus (GP), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and thalamus. RESULTS: Compared to the HC group, the MDD group had significantly lower baseline LFS (indicative of higher iron) in the left GP and left putamen and had a higher number of subjects with impairment in a test of information processing speed. In the MDD group, lower LFS values in the left and right ACC, right putamen, right GP, and right thalamus were significantly associated with depression severity; and lower LFS in the right GP was correlated with worse performance on measures of attention. All MBCT participants experienced depression relief. MBCT treatment also significantly improved executive function and attention. MBCT participants with lower baseline LFS values in the right caudate experienced significantly greater improvement in depression severity with treatment; and those with lower LFS values in the right ACC, right caudate, and right GB at baseline performed better on measures of verbal learning and memory after MBCT. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the potential contribution of subtle differences in brain iron to MDD symptoms and their successful treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an evidence-based treatment for depression. The current study focused on the long-term outcomes of MBCT for chronically, treatment-resistant depressed patients during a 6-months follow-up period. Additionally, predictors of treatment outcomes were explored. METHOD: The outcomes of MBCT on depressive symptoms, remission rates, quality of life, rumination, mindfulness skills and self-compassion were investigated in a cohort of chronically, treatment-resistant depressed outpatients (N = 106), who had taken part in an RCT comparing MBCT with treatment-as-usual (TAU). Measures were assessed pre-MBCT, post-MBCT, at 3-months follow-up, and at 6-months follow-up. RESULTS: Results of linear mixed effect models and Bayesian repeated measures ANOVA's reveal that depressive symptoms, quality of life, rumination, mindfulness skills and self-compassion consolidated during follow-up. Remission rates even further increased over the course of follow-up. When controlling for symptoms at baseline, higher baseline levels of rumination predicted lower depressive symptoms and quality of life at 6-month follow-up. No other predictors (i.e. duration of current depressive episode, level of treatment-resistance, childhood trauma, mindfulness skills, self-compassion) were found. LIMITATIONS: All participants received MBCT, therefore time or other non-specific effects might have influenced the results and replication studies including a control conditions are needed. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the clinical benefits of MBCT for chronically, treatment-resistant depressed patients persist up to 6 months after completing MBCT. Duration of the current episode, level of treatment-resistance, childhood trauma and baseline levels of mindfulness skills and self-compassion did not predict treatment outcome. When controlling for baseline depressive symptoms participants with high levels of rumination seem to benefit more; however more research is needed.

However, about one-third of graduates experience relapse within 1 year of completing the course. OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to explore the need and strategies for additional support following the MBCT course. METHODS: We conducted 4 focus groups via videoconferencing, two with MBCT graduates (n = 9 in each group) and two with MBCT teachers (n = 9; n = 7). We explored participants' perceived need for and interest in MBCT programming beyond the core program and ways to optimize the long-term benefits of MBCT. We conducted thematic content analysis to identify patterns in transcribed focus group sessions. Through an iterative process, multiple researchers developed a codebook, independently coded the transcripts, and derived themes. RESULTS: Participants said the MBCT course is highly valued and was, for some, \"life changing.\" Participants also described challenges with maintaining MBCT practices and sustaining benefits after the course despite using a range of approaches (ie, community and alumni-based meditation groups, mobile applications, taking the MBCT course a second time) to maintain mindfulness and meditative practice. One participant described finishing the MBCT course as feeling like \"falling off a cliff.\" Both MBCT graduates and teachers were enthusiastic about the prospect of additional support following MBCT in the form of a maintenance program. CONCLUSION: Some MBCT graduates experienced difficulty maintaining practice of the skills they learned in the course. This is not surprising given that maintained behavior change is challenging and difficulty sustaining mindfulness practice after a mindfulness-based intervention is not specific to MBCT. Participants shared that additional support following the MBCT program is desired. Therefore, creating an MBCT maintenance program may help MBCT graduates maintain practice and sustain benefits longer-term, thereby decreasing risk for depression relapse."

As a secondary analysis of a clinical trial, the aim of this study was to explore potential mechanisms through which three online-delivered approaches, added to treatment as usual, improve depressive symptoms in TRD patients. METHODS: The three approaches included (a) Minimal Lifestyle Intervention (MLI), (b) Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), and (c) Lifestyle Modification Program (LMP). Sixty-six participants with TRD completed assessments pre-post intervention (mindfulness skills [FFMQ]; self-compassion [SCS]; and experiential avoidance [AAQ-II]) and pre-intervention to follow-up (depressive symptoms [BDI-II]). Data were analyzed using within-subjects regression models to test mediation. RESULTS: Mindfulness skills mediated the effect of MBCT on depressive symptoms (ab = -4.69, 95% CI = -12.93 to-0.32), whereas the lack of experiential avoidance mediated the effect of LMP on depressive symptoms (ab = -3.22, 95% CI = -7.03 to-0.14). CONCLUSION: Strengthening mindfulness skills and decreasing experiential avoidance may promote recovery in patients with TRD, MBCT, and LMP have demonstrated that they may help increase mindfulness skills and decrease experiential avoidance, respectively. Future work will need to unpick the components of these interventions to help isolate active ingredients and increase optimization."

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Depression is prevalent. Treatment guidelines recommend practitioner-supported cognitive behavioral therapy self-help (CBT-SH) for mild to moderate depression in adults; however, dropout rates are high. Alternative approaches are required. OBJECTIVE: To determine if practitioner-supported mindfulness-based cognitive therapy self-help (MBCT-SH) is superior to practitioner-supported CBT-SH at reducing depressive symptom severity at 16 weeks postrandomization among patients with mild to moderate depression and secondarily to examine if practitioner-supported MBCT-SH is cost-effective compared with practitioner-supported CBT-SH. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was an assessor- and participant-blinded superiority randomized clinical trial with 1:1 automated online allocation stratified by center and depression severity comparing practitioner-supported MBCT-SH with practitioner-supported CBT-SH for adults experiencing mild to moderate depression. Recruitment took place between November 24, 2017, and January 31, 2020. The study took place in 10 publicly funded psychological therapy services in England (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies [IAPT]). A total of 600 clients attending IAPT services were assessed for eligibility, and 410 were enrolled. Participants met diagnostic criteria for mild to moderate depression. Data were analyzed from January to October 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Participants received a copy of either an MBCT-SH or CBT-SH workbook and were offered 6 support sessions with a trained practitioner. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The preregistered primary outcome was Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score at 16 weeks postrandomization. The primary analysis was intention-to-treat with treatment arms masked. RESULTS: Of 410 randomized participants, 255 (62.2%) were female, and the median (IQR) age was 32 (25-45) years. At 16 weeks postrandomization, practitioner-supported MBCT-SH (n = 204; mean [SD] PHQ-9 score, 7.2 [4.8]) led to significantly greater reductions in depression symptom severity compared with practitioner-supported CBT-SH (n = 206; mean [SD] PHQ-9 score, 8.6 [5.5]), with a between-group difference of -1.5 PHQ-9 points (95% CI, -2.6 to -0.4; P = .009; d = -0.36). The probability of MBCT-SH being cost-effective compared with CBT-SH exceeded 95%. However, although between-group effects on secondary outcomes were in the hypothesized direction, they were mostly nonsignificant. Three serious adverse events were reported, all deemed not study related. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, practitioner-supported MBCT-SH was superior to standard recommended treatment (ie, practitioner-supported CBT-SH) for mild to moderate depression in terms of both clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Findings suggest that MBCT-SH for mild to moderate depression should be routinely offered to adults in primary care services. TRIAL REGISTRATION: isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN13495752.",

We aimed to develop clinical prediction models to inform adults with recurrent depression choosing between antidepressant medication (ADM) maintenance or switching to Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). Using data from the PREVENT trial (N=424), we constructed prognostic models using elastic net regression that combined demographic, clinical and psychological factors to predict relapse at 24 months under ADM or MBCT. Only the ADM model (discrimination performance: AUC=.68) predicted relapse better than baseline depression severity (AUC=.54; one-tailed DeLong's test: z=2.8, p=.003). Individuals with the poorest ADM prognoses who switched to MBCT had better outcomes compared to those who maintained ADM (48% vs. 70% relapse, respectively; superior survival times [z=-2.7, p=.008]). For individuals with moderate-to-good ADM prognosis, both treatments resulted in similar likelihood of relapse. If replicated, the results suggest that predictive modeling can inform clinical decision-making around relapse prevention in recurrent depression."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: One third of cancer patients and survivors experience psychological distress. Previous studies have shown that online mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (eMBCT) supports cancer patients and survivors in managing distress. Lack of peer support and asynchronicity during online interventions have been reported as barriers for treatment adherence and can result in higher drop-out rates. Considering this, two new formats of eMBCT were created. The primary objective of the Buddy trial is to evaluate the (cost) effectiveness of blended and unguided eMBCT versus care as usual (CAU) on psychological distress among cancer patients and survivors. Secondary objectives include evaluating effects on other psychological outcomes and investigating working mechanisms and treatment effect moderators. METHODS: The Buddy trial is a parallel three-armed randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to blended therapist-assisted eMBCT, unguided individual eMBCT or CAU. Eligible participants will be Dutch-speaking adult cancer patients or survivors with access to internet. The primary outcome will be psychological distress scores as assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale immediately post-treatment. Secondary outcome measures include fear of cancer recurrence (FCRI), fatigue (CIS-F), rumination (RRQ), mindfulness skills (FFMQ), decentering (EQ), self-compassion (SCS-SF), positive mental health (MHCSF), health related quality of life (EQ-5D), and costs associated with psychiatric illness (TiC-P). Outcome measures will be evaluated at baseline, mid-treatment, immediately post-treatment, and three-, six-, and nine-months follow-up. Possible mediators, such as engagement with interventions (TWEETS), and moderators will be also analyzed. DISCUSSION: There is room to improve eMBCT for cancer patients prior to implementation to ensure adherence and scalability. Blended and unguided eMBCT may reduce psychological distress and improve quality of life and be easily accessible to cancer patients and survivors.

During treatment, patients with MDD may experience repeated episodes, negative counseling, and suicidal ideation, which can lead to further depression and ultimately affect quality of life. Recent studies have shown that MBCT can improve the level of depression and suicidal ideation in patients with MDD. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted. The literature search for articles up to December 2021 was performed in the following electronic databases: Airiti Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PubMed/MEDLINE, ProQuest, and the Index of the Taiwan Periodical Literature System. Records were independently evaluated by two reviewers. Disagreements were resolved through consensus. The quality of study was evaluated using the Modified Jadad Scale score. A meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager Version 5.3.5 software with a random-effects model. Thirteen studies (1159 participants) investigating MBCT for patients with MDD were included. The MBCT sessions lasted 1.5-2.5 h and were delivered by therapists five times per week for 8 weeks. The meta-effects of MBCT among patients with MDD showed significant improvement in depression and suicidal ideation. Future research should evaluate the long-term effects of MBCT. MBCT is relatively convenient and effective for preventing and alleviating depression and suicidal ideation. Further research can provide detailed suggestions for effective MBCT implementation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Major depression represents a pressing challenge for health care. In England, Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services provide evidence-based psychological therapies in a stepped-care approach to patients with depression. While introduction of these services has successfully increased access to therapy, estimates suggest that about 50% of depressed patients who have come to the end of the IAPT pathway still show significant levels of symptoms. This study will investigate whether Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), a group intervention combining training in mindfulness meditation and elements from cognitive therapy, can have beneficial effects in depressed patients who have not responded to high-intensity therapy in IAPT. It will seek to establish the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MBCT as compared to the treatment these patients would usually receive. METHODS: In a 2-arm randomised controlled trial, patients who currently meet the criteria for major depressive disorder and who have not sufficiently responded to at least 12 sessions of IAPT high-intensity therapy will be allocated, at a ratio of 1:1, to receive either MBCT (in addition to treatment as usual [TAU]) or continue with TAU only. Assessments will take place at baseline, 10 weeks and 34 weeks post-randomisation. The primary outcome will be reduction in depression symptomatology 34 weeks post-randomisation as assessed using the Public Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Secondary outcomes will include depressive symptomatology at 10 weeks post-randomisation and other clinical outcomes measured at 10-week and 34-week follow-up, along with a series of binarised outcomes to indicate clinically significant and reliable change. Evaluations of cost-effectiveness will be based on assessments of service use costs collected using the Adult Service Use Schedule and health utilities derived from the EQ-5D. DISCUSSION: This trial will add to the evidence base for the use of MBCT in depressed treatment non-responders. It will constitute the first trial to test MBCT following non-response to psychological therapy, with results providing a direct estimate of efficacy within the IAPT pathway. As such, its results will offer an important basis for decisions regarding the adoption of MBCT for non-responders within IAPT. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05236959.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: There is substantial evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) improve symptoms and functioning in adults with mood and psychotic disorders. There has been little work directly comparing these treatments among adolescents with early-onset mood or psychosis symptoms. METHOD: We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing remotely administered group CBT to group MBCT for adolescents (ages 13-17) with a mood disorder or attenuated psychosis symptoms. Adolescents attended nine sessions over 2 months; their parents attended parallel groups focused on the same skill practices. Participants were assessed for psychiatric symptoms and functioning at posttreatment and 3 months posttreatment. RESULTS: Sixty-six youth (Mage = 15.1 years, SD = 1.4; 44 females [66.7%]) initiated the trial (32 in CBT and 34 in MBCT), with 54 retained at posttreatment and 53 at the 3-month follow-up. The treatments were associated with comparable improvements in adolescents' mood, anxiety, attenuated psychosis symptoms, and psychosocial functioning over 5 months. CBT was associated with greater improvements than MBCT in emotion regulation and well-being during the posttreatment period. MBCT (compared to CBT) was associated with greater improvements in social functioning among adolescents with greater childhood adversity. Both treatments had comparable rates of retention, but youth and parents reported more satisfaction with CBT than MBCT. CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effect of both treatments in a group telehealth format is encouraging. Due to our limited sample, future research should investigate whether adolescents' history of adversity and treatment preferences replicate as treatment moderators for youth with mood or psychosis symptoms.

      "abstract": "The process-based approach assumes that transdiagnostic psychological processes are involved in the onset and maintenance of mental disorders. Case conceptualization is used to identify such psychological processes and to individualize the intervention accordingly. This approach is fundamentally different from syndrome-based approaches in which standardized treatments are administered for psychiatric diagnoses or symptoms. In the current case, we proposed a process-based conceptualization and treatment for a woman with concomitant problematic substance use and emotional symptoms. Our idiosyncratic process-based conceptualization showed that for this person, substance abuse consisted in a maladaptive coping strategy to deal with repetitive negative thinking and poor emotion regulation skills, for which we decided to use a mindfulness-based intervention. Treatment comprised 8 weeks of individually delivered mindfulness-based cognitive therapy sessions. A comprehensive assessment of psychiatric symptoms and psychological processes was conducted at baseline, post-intervention and 3-month follow-up. The post-treatment assessment revealed that psychological processes targeted by the intervention were improved, together with the mindfulness trait. At the symptom-based level, we observed a significant reduction in substance abuse and emotional symptoms. Treatment gains were maintained at follow-up. From a process-based perspective, this result implies that the intervention successfully targeted the psychological processes underlying the presenting symptoms. Adopting a process-based approach rather than symptom- or syndrome-based approaches is a valuable alternative in the conceptualization and treatment of complex cases presenting with multiple comorbidities.",

      "abstract": "Existing and emerging evidence indicates that perinatal depression is a key contributor to preventable morbidity and mortality during and after childbearing. Despite this, there are few effective options for prevention and treatment that are readily accessible for and appealing to pregnant people. Aspects of routine health care systems contribute to this situation. Furthermore, societal and health care systems factors create additional barriers for people of color, people living in rural regions, and people living in poverty. Our interprofessional team of perinatal care providers, mental health providers, community partners, health services scientists, health equity scientists, and business leaders developed and are piloting a perinatal mental health preventive intervention designed to increase access and appeal of a program incorporating mindfulness cognitive behavioral therapy with proven efficacy in preventing perinatal depression. In this article, we briefly summarize key systems barriers to delivering preventive care for perinatal depression in standard prenatal care clinics. We then describe Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Perinatal Depression and outline our adaptation of this intervention, Center M. Finally, we identify next steps, challenges, and opportunities for this recent innovation.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sarcoidosis-associated fatigue is highly prevalent and is often reported as the most burdensome symptom of sarcoidosis. Management of fatigue is challenging, and evidence-based therapies are lacking. In this TIRED trial, we aimed to assess the effects of a 12-week online mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (eMBCT) on fatigue. METHODS: This study was a prospective, open-label, multicentre randomised controlled trial, conducted at three centres in the Netherlands. Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had stable sarcoidosis, and a score of more than 21 points on the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS). Patients were randomised into either the eMBCT or the control group. Participants completed patient-reported outcome measures at baseline, after intervention (T1), and 12 weeks after completion of eMBCT (T2). The primary outcome was the change in FAS score at T1 in the eMBCT group compared with the control group, assessed with the independent students't test in all patients who started the study. Secondary outcomes included within-group difference in FAS score at T1 and T2, between-group difference in FAS score at T2, and changes in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory-Short Form, and the Kings Sarcoidosis Questionnaire. The study was registered at the Netherlands Trial Register, NL7816. FINDINGS: Between June 5, 2019, and Oct 28, 2021, 99 patients were randomly assigned to the eMBCT (n=52) or the control (n=47) groups. Six patients withdrew consent after psychological screening before the start of eMBCT. Baseline FAS score was similar in both groups (34·57 [SD 6·07] for 46 patients in the eMBCT group and 35·51 [4·65] for 47 patients in the control group). Mean change in FAS score at T1 was -4·53 (SD 5·77; p<0·0001) in the eMBCT group and -1·28 (3·80; p=0·026) in the control group (between-group difference 3·26 [95% CI 1·18 to 5·33; p=0·0025]). Furthermore, the eMBCT group had a significant improvement in anxiety (mean between-group difference 1·69, 95% CI 0·22-3·16; p=0·025), depressive symptoms (1·52, 0·08-2·95; p=0·039), mindfulness (3·1, 0·70-5·49; p=0·022), and general health status (6·28, 2·51-10·06; p=0·002) at T1, compared with the control group. INTERPRETATION: 12 week eMBCT improves fatigue, anxiety, depression, mindfulness, and health status in patients with sarcoidosis-associated fatigue.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on depressive symptoms in people with stroke. METHODS: The PubMed, CINAL, Web of Science, Embase, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, and Wangfang databases were searched for relevant articles from inception to September 1st, 2022. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effect of MBSR and MBCT on depressive symptoms in poststroke patients were included. Data extraction and critical appraisal were conducted independently by two investigators. RESULTS: Seven trials with 502 participants were included. Using standardized mean differences, the meta-analysis showed evidence of a significant effect in depression (SMD = -0.93, 95% CI (-1.34 to -0.53), Z = 4.48, p < 0.001). MBSR and MBCT both affected depressive emotions in poststroke participants with depression (SMD = -1.27, 95% CI (-1.71 to -0.84), p < 0.001) and poststroke participants without clinically defined depression (SMD = -0.46, 95% CI (-0.75 to -0.17), p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Although populations with stroke seem to potentially improve moods from MBSR/MBCT intervention, the impact on the physiological parameters of the disease has not been determined. Further studies with long-term follow-up and higher qualities are warranted for such interventions to determine the full effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Facial emotion recognition plays an important role in social functioning. Patients with late-life depression (LLD) often have abnormal facial emotion recognition. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is beneficial in treating depression. This study examined whether MBCT can act as an effective augmentation of antidepressants and improve facial emotion recognition in patients with LLD and its underlying neural mechanism. Patients with LLD were randomized into two groups (n = 30 per group). The MBCT group received an eight-week MBCT in conjunction with stable medication treatment. The other group was treated as usual (TAU group) with stable medication treatment. The positive affect (PA) scale, negative affect (NA) scale, and facial emotion recognition task with an fMRI scan were performed before and after the trial. After eight weeks of treatment, the repeated ANOVA showed that the PA score in the MBCT group significantly increased [F (1,54) = 13.31, p = 0.001], but did not change significantly [F (1,54) = 0.58, p = 0.449] in the TAU group. The NA scores decreased significantly in both the MBCT group [F (1,54) = 19.01, p < 0.001] and the TAU group [F (1,54) = 16.16, p < 0.001]. Patients showed an increase in recognition accuracy and speed of angry and sad faces after 8 weeks of MBCT. No improvement was detected in the TAU group after treatment. A significant interaction effect was found in the change of activation of the left superior temporal gyrus (L-STG) to negative emotional expression between time and groups. Furthermore, a decrease in activation of L-STG to negative emotional expression was positively correlated with the increase in PA score. The MBCT is beneficial for improving affect status and facial emotion recognition in patients with LLD, and the L-STG is involved in this process."
