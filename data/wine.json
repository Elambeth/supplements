      "abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a common adverse drug reaction that can result in liver injury, particularly in cases of paracetamol (APAP) abuse. Schisandra sphenanthera Rehd. et Wils. has attracted attention due to its hepatoprotective properties, and the underlying mechanism is unclear. In this study, a mouse model of APAP-induced liver injury was employed to evaluate network pharmacology analysis, histopathological analysis, the gut microbiota, and fecal metabolome to investigate the mechanism by which S. sphenanthera fruit extract (SFE) alleviates DILI. Network pharmacology indicated that the SFE can attenuate APAP-induced liver injury via key targets, including MAPK3 and CASP3. Furthermore, SFE effectively alleviated APAP-induced oxidative stress (MDA, SOD, and GSH) and inflammation (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β). Further analysis of gut microbiota and fecal metabolites revealed that SFE promoted the growth of Bacteroidales and Erysipelotrichales, and decreased the growth of Lactobacillales, leading to increased production of tryptophan metabolites. Correlation analysis showed that the increase in gut microbiota by SFE was positively correlated with improved antioxidant ability and improved liver and gut function. In conclusion, SFE pretreatment can alleviate APAP-induced liver injury by targeting the gut-liver axis, and provides a valuable reference for the clinical use of SFE in the prevention or treatment of DILI."

      "abstract": "At Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust, Pulsed Dye Laser (PDL) therapy is the first line laser treatment for port wine birthmarks (PWB). For recalcitrant PWB, we use triple wavelength therapy using Multiplex laser which is a combination of PDL 585 nm and Nd: YaG 1064 nm, superimposed by PDL at 595 nm five minutes later. Known complications following laser therapy are pain, redness, and bruising, however, scarring is very rare. In this the study we were keen to determine and publish the incidence and the possible risk factors associated with perioral scarring as a complication of laser therapy. A single centre retrospective observational study was performed amongst children aged 3-18 years with facial and perioral PWB who were treated with laser therapy. Patients who were treated for other facial vascular anomalies were excluded from the study. A total of 139 patients with perioral PWB were treated with laser from January 2019 to January 2022. The incidence of perioral scarring after laser treatment was 4.3% (6 patients) over a 3-year period. We found that the key risk factors for scarring were use of multiplex laser (particularly Nd: YaG), inadequate post-operative nursing care, lack of parental education, abnormal wound healing, and equipment failure with improper delivery of cooling. We concluded that the use multiplex laser (particularly Nd: YaG) entails a higher risk for peri-oral scarring. The perioral area is more vulnerable to complications and scarring from laser treatment, because the dermis in this area is thin and sensitive. The complications from laser therapy can be minimised by early recognition of pre-scarring signs, nursing advice and early treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hemoporfin-mediated photodynamic therapy (HMME-PDT) is a novel and promising treatment for port-wine stains (PWS); however, the factors affecting the efficacy and safety are controversial. AIM: In this study, the relationship between influential factors and the efficacy and safety of HMME-PDT for facial PWS was clarified. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 155 patients suffering from facial PWS who underwent HMME-PDT at 2-3 months interval were included. The efficacy was evaluated by the facial PWS area and severity index (FSASI) scoring system based on pre- and post-treatment photographs of the lesion. The demographic characteristics, lesion patterns, treatment history, number of treatment sessions, and adverse events were also recorded. RESULTS: After the first and second sessions of HMME-PDT, 61.9% and 92.9% of patients responded, respectively. The lesion subtype, degree of lip involvement, and number of HMME-PDT sessions were associated with the efficacy of HMME-PDT (p = 0.014, p = 0.034, p < 0.001, and respectively). Logistic regression analysis confirmed that the patients with red-type PWS (p = 0.019) and more HMME-PDT sessions (≥ 2) (p < 0.001) showed an association with a better response to HMME-PDT. The response rate was higher for lesions on the mandibular prominence area than that on the forehead area (p = 0.031). No photosensitivity or systemic adverse reactions were reported. Most adverse effects were well tolerated in all patients. Furthermore, the severity of crust was found positively associated with the efficacy (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: HMME-PDT is an effective and safe treatment approach for treating facial PWS. Patients who had red-type, nonforehead area, and more treatment sessions showed an association with better efficacy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pulsed-dye lasers (PDLs) are currently regarded as the gold standard for treating port-wine birthmarks (PWBs). Recently, the large-spot, variable-sequenced, long-pulsed potassium titanyl phosphate laser (KTP) has been introduced as a promising alternative for addressing dermatologic vascular lesions. Despite its growing use, data on the efficacy and safety of this technology in treating PWBs over an extended period remain limited. AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a large-spot, variable-sequenced, long-pulsed KTP in the treatment of PWBs over 3 years. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on PWB patients treated with the KTP between October 2021 and October 2024. Treatment outcomes were assessed using colorimetric analysis based on the CIE L*a*b* color space system and by measuring the surface area of the lesions. All adverse events (AEs) were documented. RESULTS: A total of 69 patients were included, with a mean age of 36.5 ± 15.6 years. 59.4% were female. Colorimetric analysis revealed an average lightening of PWBs by 75.7% ± 36.1%. Additionally, the surface area of the lesions decreased by 25.3% ± 24.4%. No severe AEs, such as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or scarring, were observed. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential of large-spot, variable-pulsed KTP as a safe and effective alternative for treating PWBs, demonstrating significant lesion lightening and surface area reduction. With no severe AEs observed, the findings suggest that this technology could complement or serve as an alternative to PDLs. Further prospective studies are warranted to optimize treatment protocols and evaluate long-term outcomes compared to PDL and other vascular treatment options.",

The reports of secondary oxalate nephropathy induced by high doses of vitamin C, portulaca oleracea, Peanut were described, but the cause as yellow wine consumption are rare. We report a 63-year-old man with acute kidney injury due to yellow rice wine. The patient has drunk yellow rice wine 500 mL/day for the past 10 years. He underwent an ultrasound-guided renal biopsy, which showed acute tubular injury and birefringent crystals were observed in the renal tubules under a polarizing microscope. The 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion established and the baseline serum creatinine of 407 µmol/L. Following 3 months therapy, subsequent laboratory evaluation demonstrated significant reduction in urinary oxalate excretion excretion and serum creatinine normal. CONCLUSIONS: Acute secondary oxalate nephropathy due to excessive dietary intake of oxalate may lead to AKI. Kidney biopsies in unknown cause AKI patients is important and attention should be payed to food behaviors when reasons for AKI are explored.",

METHODS: We examined the MEDLINE (via PubMed), Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases to conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis. PROSPERO has already recorded this study under registration number CRD42023396666. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies were included in this systematic review, and 29 were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled ES for the effect of red wine consumption on the different lipid profile parameters was significant only for the effect of red wine on the LDL parameter in the prepost studies (-0.29 (95% CI -0.54, -0.05)). The pooled ES for the effect of white wine in prepost studies and clinical trials for the effect of wine consumption on the different parameters did not show any significant results. CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that wine consumption has an effect on reducing LDL and has no effect on total cholesterol, HDL, triglycerides, or fibrinogen. This research revealed that the duration of the intervention affects triglyceride and total cholesterol levels, indicating that longer interventions are more effective for these two parameters.

As such, accurately illustrating system mechanisms with a robust and convincing methodology is crucial, while the influence of substrates must not be overlooked. In this Perspective, established techniques and critical issues are systematically compiled to serve as practical guidelines. Additionally, a newly proposed pathway, the direct oxidation transfer process (DOTP), is discussed in comparison to conventional mineralization processes by reactive oxidative species (ROS) in PS-AOPs. Overall, the investigation of PS-AOP mechanisms across various heterogeneous systems remains contentious and calls for standardization, for which this work aims to serve as a valuable reference.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Some patients with port-wine stain (PWS) who have undergone several sessions of pulsed dye laser (PDL) treatment desire further improvement through hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) photodynamic therapy (PDT). We attempted to analyse a possible number of recommended sessions and factors influencing the efficacy of multiple sessions of HMME-PDT for facial PDL-resistant PWSs. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with facial PDL-resistant PWSs who underwent at least three HMME-PDT sessions were included in this study. All patients received an intravenous injection of HMME (5 mg/kg) followed by 532-nm light-emitting diode green light therapy. Cumulative improvement scores and single improvement scores were obtained after each session to evaluate the degree of improvement. RESULTS: The excellent improvement rates of patients were 0% (0/48), 8.3% (4/48), 29.2% (14/48), 38.5% (10/26), and 50.0% (8/16) after 1-5 HMME-PDT sessions, respectively. A significant difference was observed in the cumulative improvement scores (p < 0.0001). Moreover, there were significant differences between any two sessions in the first four HMME-PDT sessions (p = 0.003). The improvement after the first HMME-PDT session was more obvious than that after each subsequent session (p = 0.004). A PWS less than or equal to 1% of the body surface area (OR = 9.05; 95% CI, 1.42-57.57; p = 0.020) and 5-10 sessions of previous PDL treatment (OR = 8.06; 95% CI, 2.01-32.33; p = 0.003) were positive influential factors for PDL-resistant PWS. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that at least 4 HMME-PDT sessions could be recommended for patients with PDL-resistant PWSs, and the improvement after the first HMME-PDT session was the most evident compared with that after each subsequent treatment. Moreover, greater erythema and a greater number of previous PDL session were associated with poor HMME-PDT efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Songaria Cynomorium Herb (SCH), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, is recognized for its dual role as both a dietary supplement and a therapeutic agent. It is traditionally reputed to have kidney-tonifying and Yang-strengthening effects, which have made it a common ingredient in nutritious food supplements and health products. This study investigates the underlying mechanisms by which wine-steamed SCH, enhances kidney aphrodisiac qualities, focusing on the tyrosine kinase/signal transduction and transcriptional activation factor (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was employed to qualitatively analyze the chemical constituents of SCH both before and after the wine-steaming process, and the significant differential components were screened out. A kidney-Yang deficiency model was induced by intragastric administration of hydrocortisone. Subsequently, the rats were treated with either raw SCH (RSCH) or wine-steamed SCH (WSCH) medicinal solutions. Urine output, organ indices, target gland axis-related indices, and renal tissue lesions were recorded and statistically compared between the treatment and control groups. RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis were utilized to assess the mRNA and protein expression levels of the JAK/STAT pathway and HIF-1α in the renal tissues of the animals. The results indicated that the chemical composition of the SCH underwent changes before and after the steaming process. The tonifying effects observed were more pronounced with WSCH than with RSCH, suggesting that the mechanism involves the inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway and the downregulation of HIF-1α expression.",

      "abstract": "Food safety and quality awareness have reached significant relevance as consumers are more interested in authentic foods and drinks with specific organoleptic values. Among foodstuffs, grape products can be contaminated by Ochratoxin A (OTA), a mycotoxin that can occur in red grape after infection with Aspergillus carbonarius. The high affinity of grape pomace with OTA makes its use advantageous as an adsorbing/decontaminating material whether the pomace is fresh, has undergone pressing, or has undergone a stabilizing process. The effects of different grape repassage treatments on wine metabolic profiles were studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy coupled with metabolomics. The relative quantification of discriminating metabolites for activated-carbon-treated samples revealed higher levels of ethyl acetate and succinate than for the grape-pomace-repassed wine samples. On the contrary, the latter exhibited a relatively high content of glycerol, lactate, tartaric, isobutanol, isopentanol, and polyphenols. Although a specific decrease in aromatic compounds such as gallic acid, tyrosine, and tyrosol was also observed compared with the controls, for the pomace-based processes, the activated carbon treatment led to a marked general impoverishment of the metabolomic profiles, with a reduction in organic acids and glycerol. The repassage of wine over the grape pomace did not significantly affect the quality attributes of the wine, offering an alternative natural adsorbing/decontaminating material for the removal of OTA."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 595 nm pulsed dye laser (PDL) for the treatment of port wine stain (PWS) in 120 Asian infant patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out to assess the efficacy and safety of 595 nm PDL in 120 Asian infant patients with PWS. RESULTS: This study identified excellent (21.67%), good (23.33%), fair (30.83%), and poor (15.83%) clearance. Multiple treatments significantly improved efficacy, with 61.56% of patients achieving good or excellent responses after more than six sessions. Younger patients showed better treatment outcomes than older patients did. The lesion location influenced the response, with leg lesions exhibiting the poorest response. The pink lesions were the most susceptible, whereas the purple lesions displayed the least response. Smaller lesions (<10 cm²) showed a size-dependent excellent rate (41.0%) and lower poor rate (5.1%). CONCLUSION: The 595 nm PDL treatment displayed a favorable safety profile, with only mild, well-tolerated adverse effects. Rare adverse effects were resolved within 3-6 months. No severe adverse events were reported. The 595 nm PDL is safe and effective for Asian infant patients with PWS. The side effects were mild and well-tolerated by the patients."

      "abstract": "Accurate classification of port wine stains (PWS, vascular malformations present at birth), is critical for subsequent treatment planning. However, the current method of classifying PWS based on the external skin appearance rarely reflects the underlying angiopathological heterogeneity of PWS lesions, resulting in inconsistent outcomes with the common vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (V-PDT) treatments. Conversely, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is an ideal tool for visualizing the vascular malformations of PWS. Previous studies have shown no significant correlation between OCTA quantitative metrics and the PWS subtypes determined by the current classification approach. In this study, we propose a novel fine-grained classification method for PWS that integrates OCT and OCTA imaging. Utilizing a machine learning-based approach, we subdivided PWS into five distinct subtypes by unearthing the heterogeneity of hypodermic histopathology and vessel structures. Six quantitative metrics, encompassing vascular morphology and depth information of PWS lesions, were designed and statistically analyzed to evaluate angiopathological differences among the subtypes. Our classification reveals significant distinctions across all metrics compared to conventional skin appearance-based subtypes, demonstrating its ability to accurately capture angiopathological heterogeneity. This research marks the first attempt to classify PWS based on angiopathology, potentially guiding more effective subtyping and treatment strategies for PWS."

      "abstract": "Yeast derivatives are additives commonly used in winemaking for different purposes. Their manufacturing process is not well standardized, being mostly based on thermal inactivation and enzyme-induced lysis; furthermore, the main strain currently authorized for their production belongs to Saccharomyces spp. In this study, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Torulaspora delbrueckii were used as starting microorganisms, whereas ultrasounds and high hydrostatic pressure were performed to induce autolysis, with the aim to evaluate the possibility to use different strains and emerging technologies as alternatives to the traditional methods to produce yeast derivatives. The chemical composition of the products obtained as well as the volatile profile of wines aged on yeast derivatives were mostly affected by the treatments performed during the manufacturing process. T. delbrueckii showed a good aptitude as starting microorganism for producing derivatives, whereas emerging, non-thermal technologies could replace the traditional methods for inducing autolysis, allowing to obtain products with enhanced content of polysaccharides (up to 178 mg/g) and antioxidant compounds (up to 9 µmol/g), and with low odor impact. The possibility to manage the chemical composition of yeast derivatives for specific winemaking purposes may thus be possible, by using specific starting microorganism and by applying the most suitable treatment to induce autolysis."

      "abstract": "Paeoniae Radix Alba (PRA) is a traditional Chinese medicine that can be processed with wine to achieve an enhanced effect of promoting blood circulation, thus alleviating blood stasis. However, to date, the changes in the bioactive compounds of PRA before and after wine-processing, as well as the mechanisms of action and the effects on ameliorating blood stasis syndrome (BSS), have not been adequately investigated. Therefore, we systematically elucidated the material basis and mechanisms of action of PRA in the treatment of BSS before and after wine processing by integrating serum pharmacochemistry, network pharmacology, and metabolomics approaches. The wine processing method significantly affected 11 components of PRA, including gallic acid, ethyl gallate, paeoniflorin, and 3-O-methylellagic acid 4-O-β-D-glucopyranoside. Benzoylpaeoniflorin and desbenzoylpaeoniflorin are key serum components of PRA both before and after wine processing. SRC and GAPDH are the central targets through which benzoylpaeoniflorin and desbenzoylpaeoniflorin exert their ameliorative effects on BSS, respectively. The metabolomics results indicated that six metabolic pathways-pyrimidine metabolism, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, tryptophan metabolism, and lysine degradation-play important roles in the amelioration of BSS by PRA and WPRA. 2'-Deoxycytidine, cortexolone, dihydrocortisol, L-gulonic gamma-lactone, L-uridine, D-ribulose, 4-trimethylammoniobutanoic acid, and indoleacetic acid have been identified as potential biomarkers for the amelioration of BSS by PRA and WPRA. The present study significantly contributes to elucidating the processing mechanism of PRA in \"promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis through wine processing\".",

Although several other types of lasers have been used to treat PWSs, few studies have focused on the factors that affect the outcome of 577-nm yellow lasers. We aimed to assess the efficacy and prognostic factors affecting the PWS treatment by 577-nm yellow laser. This study was carried out on 42 patients with PWS. Each patient received 6-10 treatment sessions with a 577-nm yellow laser at 4-week intervals. Treatment efficacy was considered adequate when improvement of ≥ 80% of the lesion occurred. After treatment, marked improvement occurred in 7 (16.7%) patients, moderate improvement in 17 (40.5%) patients, mild improvement in 10 (23.8%) and 8 (19%) patients showed poor improvement. There was a significant association between improvement and gender of the patients and site of lesion (p = 0.028, p = 0.001, respectively). However, linear regression analysis showed that the site of the lesion can significantly predict the improvement (p < 0.001), while other baseline characteristics were not associated and cannot act as predictors for improvement. Yellow laser is a successful therapy choice for PWS, with a statistically significant improvement and minimal adverse effects. No significant association was found between improvement following laser therapy and baseline parameters, except for the location of PWS.",

In this paper, the potential impacts on color and mouthfeel characteristics in wine, without pomace or prolonged pomace contact after different microwave treatment times, were investigated during storage. The results indicated that the trend changes in color and mouthfeel related parameters (including visible spectrum, brightness, red hue, yellow hue, color difference, saturation, hue angle, total polyphenol content, total monomer anthocyanins, total tannins, total flavan-3-ols, epigallocatechin, catechin, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, and fluorescence spectrum) after microwave-treated and natural aged wines without pomace and prolong pomace contact were very similar. Moreover, changes in these organoleptic parameters of microwave-treated wine were faster than those of untreated wine, which required a long aging time in traditional processing. Also, microwave treatment had a long-term influence on color and mouthfeel characteristics. All these results showed that prolonged pomace contact technology could obviously improve the clarity and yellowness of wine, and microwave technology could reduce wine aging and rapidly change its color and mouthfeel characteristics. In summary, prolonged pomace contact technology is an interesting strategy to replace traditional fining agents. Microwave technology, as an efficient artificial aging technology, might reduce aging time and rapidly change organoleptic characteristics for producing high quality wine."

Participants were assigned to three groups: Group A abstained from alcohol (n 20), Group B consumed red wine (n 21) and Group C (n 16) consumed an alcoholic beverage without wine micro-constituents. Biological samples were collected at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks. Enzyme activities of acetyl-CoA:lyso-platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetyltransferase, cytidine 5'-diphospho (CDP)-choline:1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol cholinephosphotransferase (PAF-cholinephosphotransferase), PAF-acetylhydrolase in leukocyte homogenates, serum lipoprotein-associated phospholipase-A2 and plasma markers of thrombosis were measured. PAF-, ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation was measured in human platelet-rich plasma. Red wine consumption led to a 15·3 % reduction in LysoPAF-acetyltransferase activity at 4 weeks (P= 0·008) compared with baseline and Group A (P= 0·01). PAF-cholinephosphotransferase activity was reduced by 11·1 % at 8 weeks (P= 0·04) compared with baseline and by 24·9 % compared with Group C (P= 0·02). PAF-acetylhydrolase activity was reduced by 36·2 % at 8 weeks compared with baseline (P= 0·001) and compared with Group A (P< 0·000) and Group C (P= 0·009). Fibrinogen levels in Group B reduced by 6-9 % at 4 (P= 0·04) and 8 weeks (P= 0·01) compared with baseline while D-dimer in Group C increased by 16·1 % at 8 weeks (P= 0·005) compared with baseline. Platelet aggregation against PAF and collagen was reduced in Group B (82·6 and 35·4 %, respectively), and in Group C (158·4 and 37·1 %, respectively) compared with baseline and Group A (P< 0·05). In conclusion, moderate wine consumption improved the activity of PAF-metabolism enzymes regardless of ethanol and reduced platelet aggregation, probably through mechanisms different from those of ethanol."

Although polyphenols from wine may have effects on hepcidin expression and iron absorption contrary to that of alcohol, we recently showed that consumption of 300 ml of red wine for 3 weeks, after an alcohol-free lead-in period of 2 weeks, resulted in decreased serum hepcidin in apparently healthy individuals (n = 13) and subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (n = 18). To determine the mechanism of decrease in hepcidin after wine intervention, additional biochemical analyses of spare serum samples from the same subjects were performed. The decrease in hepcidin was accompanied by increased erythropoietin levels in both groups, while the increase in erythroferrone reached statistical significance only in the T2D group. These results suggest activation of the erythropoietin-erythroferrone-hepcidin pathway by red wine consumption. As an indicator of the activation of the erythropoietin-erythroferrone-hepcidin pathway we observed an increase in the red cell distribution width in both groups and in the reticulocyte count in the T2D group, while serum ferritin decreased. Our study reveals a novel biological effect of wine that may be important in conditions influencing iron homeostasis and functions of hepcidin in general.",

Analyzing evolutionary trends and research focal points can illuminate current deficiencies and guide future investigations. We aim to conduct a scientometric analysis and meta-analysis to uncover the historical trajectory, research hotspots, and future directions of PWS. METHODS: We conducted a scientometric analysis of articles related to PWS published between 2000 and 2023. Data were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) and analyzed using R software, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace. Furthermore, we retrieved articles reporting therapeutic clearance rates for PWS from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane search engines. A meta-analysis was performed using Stata/MP to assess whether treatment outcomes for PWS have improved in the 21st century. RESULTS: The annual scientific output was stable from 2000 to 2023. The top three countries in terms of document production were the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. Pulsed dye laser (PDL) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) were the two primary modalities used in the treatment of PWS. A notable difference exists in the preference for these treatment modalities between China and Western countries. The meta-analysis shows improvement in treatment outcomes for PWS from 2000 to 2023. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited, treatment outcomes for PWS have shown improvement in the 21st century. However, there is a critical need for research directions that could revolutionize current treatment practices. Genetic discoveries have suggested promising therapeutic targets for potential breakthroughs in the future.",

This study demonstrates that X-ray and electron beam irradiation significantly enhance phenolic and aromatic compound extraction in wine, showing the potential of irradiation technology in the wine industry."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether mediated photodynamic therapy (HMME-PDT) in treating children with port-wine stains (PWS). METHOD: Literature related to the topic was searched in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and China Science Technology Journal Database online databases. The quality of the literature was evaluated using the Effective Public Health Practice Project. The I2 statistic was used to evaluate the consistency of the results. RESULTS: A total of 19 papers were included. Meta-analysis showed that more than half of the children (56.3%) achieved efficacy I (improvement ≥ 60%). 17% of children achieved efficacy II (improvement ≥ 75%). Regardless of whether the outcome variable was efficacy I or efficacy II, the therapeutic efficacy in children with PWS aged 0-3 years was superior to those aged 3-6 and 6-18 years, and children who underwent a treatment course of ≥3 sessions showed better outcomes compared to those who have only 1 or 2 sessions. After treatment with HMME-PDT, better efficacy was seen in the PWS of the face and neck and pink/red PWS. Additionally, almost all children with PWS treated with HMME-PDT developed edema (99.9%), more than half presented purpura (67.6%), some developed crust (30.8%) and hyperpigmentation (15.0%), and a few occurred scar (2.4%) and hypopigmentation (1.4%). CONCLUSION: After HMME-PDT treatment, more than half of the pediatric patients showed an improvement of ≥60%, and no serious adverse reaction events occurred. This study demonstrated that HMME-PDT possessed promising therapeutic efficacy in children with PWS, suggesting that HMME-PDT could be considered a recommended treatment strategy for pediatric PWS. However, future development of standardized assessment guidelines and comparative studies are needed to validate the aforementioned conclusions.

      "abstract": "The aroma and nutrition of Japanese apricot fruit change continuously as the fruit ripens. The differences in fruit aroma and nutrition can affect the resulting wine, which is produced by steeping the Japanese apricot fruit. In this study, we used HS-SPME-GC-MS to examine the aromatic compositions of Japanese apricot fruit and wine produced from its macerated fruit at different levels of ripeness. We employed UPLC to examine the nutritional components such as organic acids, amygdalin, and phenolics to support the identification of the optimal ripening time. The microwave aging technology was also used to treat the steeped mume wine in order to explore the optimal conditions for microwave aging. We found that the optimum aroma period for the 'Nannong Longxia' fruit was 81 d after flowering. Furthermore, the changes in the aroma of mume wine after steeping in 65%vol base wine were closer to those of the fruit than those of 42%vol base wine, and the optimum period for the aroma of mume wine after steeping was the same as the fruit. Analysis showed that the optimum nutritional period for the fruit coincided with the optimum aromatic period. The best aromatic and nutritional components of the finished wine were obtained when the fruit was picked 81 days after flowering and the steeped mume wine was made with a 65%vol base wine. Microwave aging technology can significantly increase the proportion of esters in the aroma composition and reduce the content of acids. Among them, 500 W treatment at 50 °C for 80 min had the best effect on improving aroma components. These findings represent a theoretical foundation for exploring the aroma optimum period for Japanese apricot fruit and steeped mume wine, and for determining the optimum harvest periods for production.",

Novel methods aimed at lowering sulfites used for wine stabilization are sought. UV-C irradiation has been proposed as an alternative for reducing the viable cell count of microorganisms in wine and grape juice. Nevertheless, UV-C treatment poses the risk of altering the chemical properties of wine. Therefore, this study aimed to test and implement iron oxide-silica core-shell nanomaterial functionalized with TiO2 in UV-C treatment of white and red wines. Material for the study consisted of the synthesized nanocomposite, Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model yeast, and Muscaris and Cabernet Cortis wines. The viability of yeasts under treatment, the physiochemical properties of wine, and polyphenol content were tested. Studies have shown that nanomaterial can modulate the effects of UV-C treatment regarding yeast viability and polyphenol content, and the effectiveness of the treatment depends on the wine type. These results open up discussion on the possible use of the proposed hurdle technology in winemaking to control the polyphenol composition and alcohol reduction.",

To address this gap, this study explored the effect of foliar Mn application on the aroma traits of grapes and wine. Mn nutrient solutions at different concentrations (0 (CK), 300, 1200, and 2400 mg/L) were sprayed on grapevines in 2017 and 2018 and the volatile compounds, odor activity, and sensory features of grapes and wine were investigated. The results showed that Mn application significantly increased Mn content in grape leaves and fruits at harvest. Compared with CK, the total volatile content of grapes was significantly increased by Mn treatment in both years because of the promotion of the accumulation of alcohols and esters. Particularly, 1200 mg/L Mn treatment resulted in a higher sensory score than CK, especially in terms of intensity, duration, and harmony. Multivariate analysis and odor activity values jointly identified eight volatile compounds (ethyl acetate, phenylethyl acetate, and phenylethyl alcohol, etc.) as key odorants that contribute to the floral and fruity flavors of Mn-treated wine. Overall, this study indicated that a moderate concentration of Mn is beneficial for improving the fragrance characteristics of grapes and wines. The results have implications for micronutrient management of grapevines to improve wine flavor quality."

To accelerate the maturation of rice wine, a 20 L scale multi-sweeping- frequency mode ultrasonic reactor was employed in this study to explore the promoting effects. Rice wines were subjected under 10 combined types of sonication treatments with 20/28/40 kHz in single/double/triple frequencies, and in fixed or sweeping modes, respectively. Then samples were aged in room temperature for up to 180 days. A 7.3 % increase of total esters content was observed in rice wine sample after treated by a fixed 40 kHz ultrasonication with 50 W/L intensity at 30 °C for 15 min, compared with the untreated sample. After sonication and stored for six months, 286.78 % increase of the volatile esters was found, compared to rice wine without ultrasoinc treatment and stored at same condition for same time. And the total volatile alcohol substances and total volatile aldehydes in rice wine decreased by 12.95 % and 67.46 %, while the total volatile acids increased by 17.11 %, respectively. The research results also demonstrated that ultrasonic induced free radicals accounted for the variations of rice wine properties.

The formation of these stilbenes was monitored in wine model solutions and red wines. The results indicated that resveratrol and piceid underwent transformation during heat treatment, forming their respective dimers.

YF and YDF wines exhibited similar correlations with aroma types, while there were differences in the kinds and number of VOCs. Moreover, CECA-inoculated fermentation was more favorable to the formation of aftertaste-A, umami, sourness, and richness. The KEGG metabolic pathway analysis indicated that the inoculation strategy significantly affected the amino acid metabolism. The antimicrobial treatment effectively enhanced bitterness, astringency, umami and saltiness while reducing acidity. Further studies are needed to assess the effects of antimicrobial treatment on lipid metabolism."

However, wine consumption information through self-reports is prone to measurement errors inherent to subjective assessments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between urinary tartaric acid, an objective biomarker of wine consumption, and the rate of a composite clinical CVD event. METHODS: A case-cohort nested study was designed within the PREDIMED trial with 1232 participants: 685 incident cases of CVD and a random subcohort of 625 participants (including 78 overlapping cases). Wine consumption was registered using validated food frequency questionnaires. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure urinary tartaric acid at baseline and after one year of intervention. Weighted Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of CVD. RESULTS: Tartaric acid was correlated with self-reported wine consumption at baseline [r = 0.46 (95% CI 0.41; 0.50)]. Five categories of post hoc urinary tartaric acid excretion were used for better representation of risk patterns. Concentrations of 3-12 and 12-35 μg/mL, which reflect ∼3-12 and 12-35 glasses/month of wine, were associated with lower CVD risk [HR 0.62 (95% CI 0.38; 1.00), P = .050 and HR 0.50 (95% CI 0.27; 0.95), P = .035, respectively]. Less significant associations between self-reported wine consumption and CVD risk were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Light-to-moderate wine consumption, measured through an objective biomarker (tartaric acid), was prospectively associated with lower CVD rate in a Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk.",

In June 2023, it received FDA clearance for the treatment of port-wine birthmarks (PWB) and infantile hemangiomas (IH) in the pediatric population. OBJECTIVE: Review the evidence regarding the efficacy, safety, and implications of using PDL for management of pediatric PWB and IH. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify peer-reviewed articles and clinical trials published between July 2002 and December 2022 in which PDL was used to treat pediatric PWB and IH. RESULTS: After application of criteria, 33 journal articles with 7725 total patients were included. Only 16 (0.8%) of the 2,033 patients with PWB and 11 (0.2%) of the 5692 patients with hemangioma reported permanent adverse effects including scarring, keloids, or permanent pigmentation change, and none reported blindness or other serious injury. Good, excellent, or complete clearance after PDL-on average or in greater than 50% of patients-was reported in 17 of 19 studies (89%) that reported these measures for PWB, and seven of the seven studies (100%) for IH. CONCLUSION: The 595-nm PDL is an excellent treatment option for early intervention in pediatric patients with PWB or IH.",

We identified 27 RCTs for qualitative analysis and twelve RCTs for the NMA, covering 1033 observations, 19 treatments, and three sub-networks. Seven studies reported on patient satisfaction. Hemoporfin-mediated photodynamic therapy was more effective in lesion clearance than PDL but had the highest risk of AEs. The 755 nm alexandrite laser and the combination of 595 nm PDL + 1064 nm Nd:YAG also showed high AE risks. Treatment discontinuation rates due to AEs did not significantly differ. Most studies had unclear bias risks, mostly owing to insufficient reporting. This study is the first NMA comparing laser- and light-based therapies for PWB. Further well-designed studies are warranted to determine optimal methods and patient-influencing factors for individualized treatments.",

However, CD needs to be processed with wine for alleviating the bitter and cold of CD, meanwhile, reducing the gastrointestinal damage. The research assessed the discrepant effects of CD on gastrointestinal system before and after processing with wine, and explore the potential mechanisms. METHODS: The ingredients in CD and CD processed with wine (PCD) were performed on Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS). The mice were treated with CD and PCD once a day for 6 weeks (0.65 and 2.6 g/kg, i.g.). The pathological changes of gastrointestinal tract were evaluated, and the serum inflammatory factors and Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) RelA (p65) protein of tissues were determined. The short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) of feces were analyzed by UPLC-MS, the gut microbiota (GM) changes were performed on 16 S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: Ingredients analysis declared that the alkaloids, flavonoids, phenylpropanoid compounds were the main metabolites in CD and PCD. CD reduced body weight and food intake, and the effect of CD on fecal water content increased first and then decreased with the prolongation of administration time, while its effect on intestinal transport time was exactly the opposite, reduced the SCFAs contents of feces. CD caused different degree of damage to the gastrointestinal tract, and the effect on the small intestine and colon was more obvious, which increased the expression of NF-κB p65 and elevated the inflammatory factors levels. PCD were weaker than that of CD. In addition, CD and PCD can change the composition of GM, and reduced the levels of Lactobacillus, Allobaculum, Ruminococcus, and norank_f_S24-7, increased the levels of Akkermansia, Dorea, Bacteroides, and Blautia at the genus level. However, PCD induced a milder effect of GM dysregulation than that of CD. CONCLUSION: CD can cause damage to the gastrointestinal tract, which may be related to the GM disorders, SCFAs changes-mediated by GM, abnormal NF-κB p65 expression and increased inflammatory factors levels, interestingly, PCD had a lower effect than CD, which may be related to the differences in the types and contents of ingredients in CD after processing. And this study provided data support for the mechanism of processing with wine to alleviate \"bitter-cold injury the stomach\" of CD."

      "abstract": "Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) is commonly employed for fining in fruit wine brewing. This study aimed to investigate the impact of PVPP pretreatment on the formation of fermentation aroma and polyphenol distribution in Rosa roxburghii Tratt (RRT) wine. A significant effect of PVPP on polyphenol adsorption was observed, and polyphenol families or subfamilies such as flavanols and flavonols showed specific affinity for PVPP, decreasing by over 19 % and 30 %, respectively. Furthermore, it was the first time to demonstrate a significant enhancement in the ester content of the corresponding RRT wine after PVPP treatment, particularly in imparting sweet and fruity esters (increased by over 40 %). In contrast, the RRT wine treated with PVPP exhibited a significant reduction of over 20 % in the concentration of higher alcohols, particularly reflected in the green and chemical aromas. This indicates that PVPP treatment could promote the transformation of RRT wine aroma from green and chemical to sweet and fruity. Correlation analysis revealed a positive relationship between the concentration of higher alcohols and most phenolic compounds in RRT wine, while quercetin 3-glucoside, rutin, and polydatin were negatively correlated with esters that can impart fruit flavor and floral aroma to fruit wine. As a practical insight into fruit wine fermentation, PVPP fining before fermentation is more likely to alter the phenolic compositions of RRT wine, thereby influencing its aroma characteristics. Specifically, polyphenols associated with energy metabolism of yeast could have stimulated the formed fluxes of esters. The association between the formation of esters and higher alcohols with phenolic compounds will provide new information on the impact of clarification treatments on yeast-derived volatile metabolites in RRT wine and hold promise in improving the aroma of RRT wine by modulating polyphenol composition through pre-clarification.",

Pulsed dye laser (PDL) is widely used for PWS treatment; however, large-scale data on pediatric cases remain limited. This retrospective study aims to investigate the efficacy of laser treatment and its related factors in a large sample. OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical efficacy and adverse reactions of 595nm PDL for treating pediatric PWS and to identify factors influencing treatment outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective study included 974 pediatric patients with PWS treated at Beijing Children's Hospital from 2003 to 2021. Inclusion criteria required patients to be under 18, with solitary PWS and Fitzpatrick skin types II-IV. Treatment efficacy was evaluated using standardized photographs taken before and after treatment, with outcomes categorized by Achauer's clearance criteria. Ridit analysis assessed the impact of variables such as gender, age, lesion location, and treatment frequency on outcomes. RESULTS: The overall efficacy rate was 65.3%, higher in females (69.7%) than males (59.7%). Adolescents had the highest efficacy (100%) due to better compliance. Limb lesions responded best (87.5%), followed by neck (75.0%), trunk (66.7%), and head/face (63.0%). Smaller lesions (≤3 cm²) achieved 76.8% efficacy. Efficacy rose with sessions, reaching 84.0% after three. The mandibular branch (V3) had the highest trigeminal efficacy (68.5%). Adverse reactions (4.31%) included pigmentation changes (2.87%), hypopigmentation (1.03%), and minimal scarring (0.41%). CONCLUSION: The efficacy of 595nm PDL for treating PWS in children is influenced by gender, age, lesion location, size, and the number of treatment sessions. PDL is an effective treatment for pediatric PWS with minimal adverse reactions."

      "abstract": "Port-wine stains (PWS) are congenital vascular malformations characterized by capillary malformations that persist and often darken over time. Traditional treatment methods, including laser therapy, have shown varying degrees of effectiveness and can be associated with significant side effects. Hematoporphyrin Monomethyl Ether-Photodynamic Therapy (HMME-PDT) has emerged as a promising alternative, offering targeted treatment with potentially fewer adverse effects. This paper aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy and potential of HMME-PDT as a treatment strategy for PWS. It provides a comprehensive review of the literature and clinical investigations to assess the application and outcomes of HMME-PDT in treating PWS. Briefly introduce the nature of PWS, innovations and challenges in treatment, the mechanism of HMME-PDT, clinical effectiveness and sonographic appearance, safety and long-term effects, and challenges and suggestions for optimizing treatment. The review highlights the mechanism by which HMME-PDT works, focusing on its ability to target abnormal blood vessels selectively. Clinical evaluations included clinical and sonographic assessments to determine the efficacy of the treatment. The findings revealed significant improvements in the clinical appearance and sonographic features of vascular lesions following HMME-PDT. The paper also discusses the utility of dermoscopy in HMME-PDT applications, factors affecting treatment efficacy, the impact of thermal assistance on the effectiveness of PDT, and the management of adverse reactions through proper nursing care. The review underscores the considerable potential of HMME-PDT as an effective treatment for PWS, noting its promising outcomes in clinical and sonographic assessments. However, it also emphasizes the need for further research to standardize treatment protocols and assess long-term outcomes.",

The present study investigates the potential of a red wine polyphenol oral extract, Provinols™, to reduce neointimal hyperplasia following angioplasty in a hypercholesterolemic rabbit model. Methods: New Zealand white rabbits were fed 1% cholesterol-enriched chow for a period of eight weeks prior to the induction of iliac balloon injury and subsequent stent placement. Following the implantation of the stent, Provinols™ (20 mg/kg/day) or an identical placebo was administered orally for a period of four weeks in a randomized manner. Twenty-eight days following the stenting procedure, the arteries were harvested after euthanasia and subjected to histology assignment analysis. Results: The administration of Provinols™ did not result in a statistically significant change in either blood pressure or plasma cholesterol levels. However, Provinols™ treatment led to a notable reduction in the growth of the intima within the stented area, as well as a reduction in the thickness and surface area of the intima. It is of note that treatment with Provinols™ was associated with a reduction in the accumulation of fat within the arteries and a diminished inflammatory response to injury. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that oral administration of Provinols™ has the potential to reduce in-stent neointimal growth and lipid deposition, likely due to its anti-inflammatory properties in iliac arteries from hypercholesterolemic rabbits. Additionally, these findings provide an evidence-based rationale for the potential therapeutic benefits of plant-derived polyphenols in the prevention of restenosis associated with stent placement."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To identify which features of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) were most associated with glaucoma onset, severity, and treatment failure at a tertiary care center. DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: Children who had SWS with and without glaucoma. METHODS: Electronic health records were reviewed for all children with SWS presenting between 2014 and 2020. Examination and imaging findings from dermatology, neurology, and ophthalmology were collected. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with glaucoma-related outcomes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included glaucoma development, progression to surgery, and treatment failure. Failure was defined as having a final intraocular pressure >21 mmHg, devastating complication, or ≤20/200 vision. RESULTS: Twenty-three of 44 SWS patients (52.3%) developed glaucoma, and 6 of 23 patients (26.1%) had both eyes affected. Sixteen of 29 eyes (55.2%) required surgery, and 29.6% overall met our failure criteria (mean follow-up: 5.1 ± 4.3 years). Glaucoma diagnosis was associated with bilateral port-wine birthmarks (PWBs; odds ratio [OR] 5.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-43.2), PWB with any lower eyelid involvement (OR 9.7, 95% CI 2.6-44.5), and choroidal hemangiomas (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.1-13.8), but was not associated with upper eyelid or leptomeningeal angiomas, seizures, prior hemispherectomy, or pulsed-dye laser. Eyes that progressed to surgery were more likely to have PWB affecting the lower eyelid (OR 33.7, 95% CI 4.5-728.0). No clinical or demographic factors were associated with treatment failure. In most cases, angle surgery failed (72.7%) but was a temporizing measure before subconjunctival filtering surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Lower eyelid and choroidal angiomas were associated with glaucoma diagnosis, suggesting a spatial relationship with SWS findings. However, leptomeningeal angiomas were not associated, possibly because these are further from the eye.

However, there is limited research on the primary active components and molecular mechanism of the bioactivity of Hakka Huangjiu. To address this gap, this study assessed the structural characteristics, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory activities of the polysaccharide-1 of Guangdong Hakka Huangjiu (HP1). Structural analysis revealed that HP1 had a low molecular weight polysaccharide of 5550 Da, primarily consisting of glucose (93.2 %), with smaller amounts of xylose, mannuronic acid and galactose. Methylation and NMR analysis suggested that the main glycosidic linkages present in HP1 are α-D-Glcp-(1→, →4)-α-D-Glcp-(1 → and →6) -α-D-Glcp-(1→. Furthermore, HP1 exhibited dose-dependent DPPH·, ABTS+ and OH· scavenging activity. HP1 exhibited significant protection of HepG2 cells from H2O2 damage. Additionally, HP1 induced the release of NO, TNF-α, IL-6 and iNOS in RAW264.7 cells. HP1 treatment significantly increased mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, IL-1β and TGF-β1. These results suggested that polysaccharides HP1 may have potential as a novel natural antioxidant and immunomodulatory product for use in nutraceuticals and functional foods.",

Global warming caused by climate change has inhibited anthocyanin biosynthesis in berry skins, leading to poor coloration. Through two-year field experiments, the endophyte che218 isolated from grape shoot xylem promoted anthocyanin accumulation in berry skins. The che218 enhanced anthocyanin biosynthesis in grapevine cultured cells. In the 2022 growing season, applying che218 to grape bunches enhanced anthocyanin accumulation in berry skins on day 20 post-treatment. However, the anthocyanin accumulation enhancing effect of che218 became negligible at harvest. In the 2023 growing season, che218 enhanced anthocyanin accumulation in berry skins on day 15 post-treatment and at harvest (day 30 post-treatment) and also upregulated the transcription of mybA1 and UFGT, two genes that regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in berry skins. Whole genome sequencing demonstrated that che218 is an unidentified Microbacterium species. However, it remains unknown how che218 is involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanin in berry skins. This study provides insights into the development of an eco-friendly endophyte-mediated technique for improving grape berry skin coloration, thereby mitigating the effects of global warming on berry skin coloration."

A moderate drying treatment (D2, 18 % water loss) produced wine with optimal red color characteristics. The D2 wine contained abundant individual phenolics such as caffeic acid, salicylic acid, resveratrol, p-coumaric acid, and proanthocyanidin B1, which exhibited strong positive correlations with color parameters (a⁎, C*ab and △E*ab). Similar trends were observed in aroma compounds, with ethyl acetate, ethyl caproate, diethyl succinate, geraniol, linalool, 4-terpinenol, α-terpineol, and β-ionone contents showing significant increment in D2, aligning with enhanced sensory evaluations of wines.

      "abstract": "Tartaric acid is one of the characteristic acids in wine, playing a crucial role in wine characteristics. However, superabundant tartaric acid will form insoluble salts and precipitate in the form of crystals, affecting consumers' purchasing appetite. Therefore, tartaric stability is also one of the important indices for controlling the wine quality. At present, the main processing methods for tartaric stability include cold stabilization, ion exchange treatment, electrodialysis and the addition of exogenous components (gum arabic, metatartaric acid, carboxymethyl cellulose, mannoprotein and potassium polyaspartate). This review summarizes and analyzes the origin of tartaric acid in wine, factors influencing the tartaric stability, detection methods, treatments for tartaric stabilization, and the effects of these methods on the sensory quality of wine. Comparing the effects of these methods on wine quality can provide a basis for the further study of tartaric stabilization methods in order to select an appropriate tartaric stabilization method."

Wine treatment with TIYs resulted in an increase in polysaccharide concentration compared to the untreated wine, with SL-TIY exhibiting the highest release. Additionally, all TIYs, particularly SL-TIY, improved protein stability by reducing heat-induced haze formation. The addition of TIYs also demonstrated an effect on color parameters through phenolic compound adsorption, preventing potential browning phenomena. All TIYs significantly impacted the wine's volatile profile. Overall, it was shown that an improvement in wine quality and stability may be obtained by using TIYs in the winemaking process."

The types and concentrations of polyphenols and volatile aromatic compounds were compared before and after HHP treatment; the results indicated that HHP treatment at 300 MPa for 20 min significantly increased the total polyphenol content to 369.70 mg/L, a rise of 35.82%. The contents of key polyphenols, such as resveratrol and protocatechuic acid, were significantly enhanced. Furthermore, while the total content of volatile aromatic compounds did not change significantly under this condition compared to the untreated samples, the concentration of ester compounds significantly increased to 1.81 times that of the untreated group, thereby enriching the floral and fruity aromas of the wine and effectively improving its aromatic profile and sensory quality. Principal component analysis (PCA) further validated the positive impact of HHP treatment on the flavor characteristics of Marselan red wine. These findings provide technical support for the use of HHP in improving wine quality."

The initial experimental alcohol was treated as the control and the dealcoholized wine the treatment. Wine treatments sharing the same alcohol target and harvest date as the dealcoholized wine were designated as the negative control. All aroma compounds measured increased because of higher ethanol or declined because of dealcoholization. Similar aroma concentrations were observed to be a factor of alcohol concentration, apart from volatile thiols which were influenced by harvest. Statistical analysis of sensory and aroma compounds showed a corresponding relationship between low versus high alcohol wines. Dealcoholization appears to be an effective tool for altering wine aroma and winemaking style with comparable aroma loss to pre-fermentation adjustment.",

According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Zhu-Ye-Qing wine (ZYQW) has the effect of invigorating blood and removing blood stasis. However, whether ZYQW can improve the progression of CCVD has not been reported. This study aims to explore the possible mechanism of ZYQW on CCVD through network pharmacology, and finally 249 potential targets of ZYQW and 2080 potential targets of CCVD are obtained. The key targets mainly include MAPK3, TP53, RELA, MAPK1 and AKT1. The main KEGG pathways include TNF signaling pathway, lipid and atherosclerosis pathway signaling pathway. The components in ZYQW are identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-CQE-CQE-MS/MS). Through network pharmacology, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation, the potential key components and prevention mechanisms of ZYQW in the prevention of CCVD are determined. ZYQW may be an effective and safe health food for the prevention of CCVD, providing guidance and basis for the further development of medicinal foods.",

Their use in aged spirits is critical to imparting flavor and mouthfeel to the final product. The reason that barrels retain liquid has been hypothesized to be the result of abundant physiological structures called tyloses in parenchyma tissues and medullary rays in white oak. Using non-destructive X-ray computed tomography (XRCT) imaging, we reveal an unprecedented view of tylose structure and quantify the pore-filling capacity of tyloses in white oak that underscores the liquid retention we observe in casks. We show that pores of white oaks are filled with sevenfold higher tylose volume compared to northern red oak (Q. rubra), consistent with prior literature that casks made from white oak retain liquid while red oak fails to do so. We propose that XRCT represents a methodological standard for observing these complex structures and should be employed to understand the many questions related to liquid losses from casks, cultural treatment of casks, and the influence of climate change on oak tyloses in the future.",

SD rats were randomly divided into four groups and diabetic nephropathy rat model was induced by high-fat diet combined with 30 mg·kg~(-1) streptozotocin(STZ). Histopathological observations of kidney tissue sections of rats in each group were conducted using HE, PAS, and Masson staining. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry(UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) metabolomics method was employed to investigate the effects of CF before and after wine-processing combined with AR-related components on plasma metabolites in diabetic nephropathy rats. After drug treatment, kidney tissue damage and interstitial collagen fiber deposition area in diabetic nephropathy rats were improved to varying degrees(P&lt;0.001). The detection results of plasma metabolomics showed that 71 biomarkers related to the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy were identified in diseased rats, mainly involving linoleic acid metabolism, caffeine metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, retinol metabolism, and ether lipid metabolism. After drug intervention, 26 of them were significantly downregulated, with better efficacy observed in precision processed herb-pair group(P-CG_5). This study elucidated from the perspective of plasma metabolomics that P-CG_5 could improve metabolic disorders in diabetic nephropathy through pathways such as phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, and caffeine metabolism, providing theoretical support and experimental basis for the clinical application of CF and AR compatibility in traditional Chinese medicine.",

Green nanotechnology has emerged as a holistic approach to address antibiotic resistance by combining environmental sustainability with improved therapeutic outcome. Nanostructure hydroxyapatite (HAP) has received significant attention in therapeutic and regenerative purposes due to its porous scaffold structure and biocompatible nature. In the present study, hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanoparticle was fabricated from the fish scale waste of red snapper fish. Black rice wine (BRW) was extracted from black rice commonly termed as Karupu kavuni/forbidden rice known for its nutritious effects. The present study focused on encapsulation of BRW within HAP nanoparticles (HAP@BRW) and evaluated its potential against nosocomial infections. Spectral and microscopic characterization of HAP@BRW revealed uniform encapsulation of BRW in HAP nanoparticles, aggregated irregular-shaped morphology of size 117.6 nm. Maximum release of BRW (72%) within 24 h indicates HAP as suitable drug delivery system suitable for biomedical applications. Antimicrobial studies revealed that HAP@BRW exhibited potent bactericidal effect against MRSA, MSSA, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Furthermore, HAP@BRW significantly inhibited the biofilm forming ability of MSSA and P. aeruginosa. Rich antioxidant property of HAP@BRW might be due to the presence of rich source of total polyphenolic, flavonoid, and anthocyanin content in BRW. In vitro and in vivo toxicity studies revealed biocompatible nature of HAP@BRW. Antibiofilm, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and biocompatible nature of HAP@BRW makes it a promising candidate for coating medical implants to avoid implant-associated infections and nosocomial infections.",

Optical coherence tomography (OCT), a noninvasive imaging technique, characterizes vessels in cutaneous vascular lesions, including PWBs. OBJECTIVE: To assess variability in blood vessel characteristics within and between individual PWBs. METHODS: OCT was used to measure blood vessel density (%) and modal vessel diameter (micrometers) at increments of 0.05 mm from the skin surface to a depth of 0.50 mm at several adjacent spots of single PWBs in this cross-sectional study. Average ratios of vessel density and diameter in affected to control skin were obtained for each PWB by averaging data for all spots within a lesion. Statistical analysis was performed with a linear mixed effects model using SPSS software (IBM Corporation). RESULTS: There was great variability in vessel density and diameter within and between PWBs. Depths where average ratios of vessel density were consistently greater in affected to control skin were shallow, between 0.15 mm and 0.2 mm deep from the skin surface. LIMITATIONS: Small sample size and device's inability to measure diameters smaller than 20 micrometers. CONCLUSION: There is variability in vessel density and diameter within and between PWBs. Individualized treatment planning guided by OCT mapping should be studied further.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Fermented milk and palm wine are regularly used by several ethnic groups in Cameroon in traditional treatment rituals for infections, inflammatory, cardiovascular disorders, and even metabolic diseases such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia etc. Reports from many studies have demonstrated that fermented milk and palm wine are potential sources of probiotic bacteria. However, the capacity of probiotics isolated from these natural sources to alleviate neuropathic pain has not been experimentally tested. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed at investigating the ameliorative potential of lactic acid bacteria isolated from palm wine and traditional fermented cow milk on the chronic constriction injury (CCI) induced neuropathic pain in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pour plating technique on De Man Rogasa (MRS) agar was utilised for isolation of lactic acid bacteria from fermented cow milk and palm wine, and identified using the 16S r RNA gene sequencing. Neuropathic pain was induced by chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve. These bacteria were orally administered at different concentrations to Balb/c mice by gavage for 14 consecutive days. Cold allodynia, mechanical hyperalgesia and exploratory behaviour were evaluated on day 0, 7th and 14th respectively. The total level of calcium, oxidative stress markers and myeloperoxidase were also quantified in the sciatic nerve homogenate. Cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2) and cytokine profile were determined from serum. RESULTS: Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from fermented cow milk and palm wine and two isolates were chosen according to their probiotic potentials and identified as strain of Limolactobacillus fermentum and Enterococcus lactis. Their 16 S rRNA gene sequences were deposited in NCBI genbank with accession number of OP896078 and OR619545, respectively. Pretreatment with Limosilactobacillus fermentum and Enterococcus lactis significantly alleviated mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia with similar effect to the reference drug, morphine. These two isolates ameliorated CCI induced neuropathic pain by increasing antioxida776nts (GSH, CAT and SOD, P < 0.01) and decreasing pro-oxidants (MDA and NO, P < 0.01). Also, they inhibited the release of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-6; P < 0.01) and IL-10 level was significantly (P < 0.01) increased when compared to the negative control. Treatment with these bacteria significantly dropped the level of total calcium (P < 0.01), COX-2 (P < 0.01) and MPO (P < 0.01) when compared with the negative control. CONCLUSION: The neuroprotective potentials of these selected lactic acid bacteria against CCI induced neuropathic pain may be attributed to their anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory properties and reduced calcium deposition in sciatic nerve.",

Dark tea exhibits great potential for various bioactivities for metabolic health. In this study, we aimed to evaluate therapeutic effects and the underlying mechanisms of dark tea wine (DTW) on MASLD with obesity. A rat model of MASLD was established by high-fat diet and administered with different doses of DTW as an intervention. The biomarkers of lipid metabolism and oxidative stress in rats were tested. The weight of organs and adipose tissues and the expressions of nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were investigated based on the pathology and western blot analysis. We found that DTW enhanced antioxidant capacity via activating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, further markedly triggering inhibition of weight gain, reduction of lipid dysfunction, and improvement of pathological characteristics to ameliorate MASLD induced by high-fat diet. These results suggest that DTW is a promising functional supplement for prevention and treatment of MASLD and obesity.",

Babić (Vitis vinifera L.) red grape variety. The grapes were obtained from two positions in the Middle and South of Dalmatia. This study compared a control treatment with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) strain as a type of sequential inoculation treatment with Lachancea thermotolerans (Lt x Sc) and Torulaspora delbrueckii (Td x Sc). The focus was on the basic wine parameters and volatile aromatic compound concentrations determined using the SPME-Arrow-GC/MS method. The results revealed significant differences in cis-linalool oxide, geraniol, neric acid, and nerol, which contribute to the sensory profile with floral and rose-like aromas; some ethyl esters, such as ethyl furoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl lactate, ethyl 2-hydroxy-3-methylbutanoate, ethyl 3-hydroxy butanoate, diethyl glutarate, and diethyl succinate, contribute to the aromatic profile with fruity, buttery, overripe, or aging aromas. A sensory evaluation of wines confirmed that Td x Sc treatments exhibited particularly positive aromatic properties together with a more intense fullness, harmony, aftertaste, and overall impression."

The identification of its antiangiogenic properties, direct impact on cancer cells, immunomodulatory effects on the tumour microenvironment, and metabolic reprogramming ability has established the intrinsic multitargeted nature of this therapeutic approach. Recently, the utilization of metronomic chemotherapy has evolved from salvage treatment for metastatic disease to adjuvant maintenance therapy for high-risk cancer patients, which has been prompted by the success of several substantial phase III trials. In this review, we delve into the mechanisms underlying the antitumour effects of metronomic chemotherapy and provide insights into potential combinations with other therapies for the treatment of various malignancies. Additionally, we discuss health-economic advantages and candidates for the utilization of this treatment option.",

This study assessed the effect of this practice on wine physicochemical, phenolic composition and sensory properties. Over four years, three organic mulches (grape pruning debris (GPD), straw (STR), and spent mushroom compost (SMC)) and two conventional practices (tillage (TILL) and herbicide (HERB)) were evaluated in two locations. Wines from mulching treatments exhibited higher pH, potassium, hue, and lower tartaric acid. Moreover, the SMC mulch treatment showed lower amounts of wine anthocyanins, flavonols and hydroxycinnamics, probably due to increased nutrient availability. However, no differences were detected in the wine sensory analysis. Therefore, organic mulches could be alternative practices to mitigate the consequences of climate change without significant impact on young wine's phenolic profile and sensory properties compared to HERB and TILL conventional soil management. However, future studies should focus on wine evolution during aging.",

The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of PVPP on the quality characteristics of Viognier wine when added pre- or post-fermentation as compared to an untreated control wine. Both PVPP-treated wines contained significantly lower concentrations of monomeric phenolics and browning pigments than the control wine (p ≤ 0.05). The addition of PVPP prior to fermentation conferred protection against oxidation of the wine as measured by acetaldehyde concentration (p ≤ 0.05). Analysis of the volatile aroma profile of each wine by headspace solid phase microextraction gas chromatographymass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) revealed that the overarching aroma profiles of the PVPP-treated wines were significantly different from the control wine, but there was no difference between wines treated with PVPP pre-fermentation versus those treated post-fermentation. Specifically, statistically significant differences were observed in 9 of the 22 quantified aroma compounds, including those notably associated with the \"stone fruit\" aroma of Viognier. A negative correlation was identified between aroma compound concentration removal and the hydrophobicity of each compound, suggesting that the observed differences in aroma may be due to adsorption of aroma compounds by PVPP. The findings from this study present risks and benefits to wine quality upon treatment with PVPP at commercially recommended levels, and provide potentially valuable information for industrial wine producers.",

However, few studies have evaluated the effects of RW and white wine (WW) on inflammatory markers related to atherosclerosis in healthy individuals and high-risk subjects for CVD. This study aimed to assess the effect of RW on inflammatory markers in healthy individuals and high-risk subjects for CVD compared with moderate alcohol consumption. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 (PRISMA) was followed in this study. The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, SinoMed, EbscoHost, and ScienceDirect databases were searched. The risk of bias and quality of the included trials were assessed using the Cochrane Handbook. The main results are summarized in Stata 12. RESULTS: Twelve studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results demonstrated that RW significantly decreased circulating intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1, and Sialyl-Lewis X expression on the surface of monocytes in healthy subjects, but not in patients with CVD. Additionally, RW significantly decreased Sialyl-Lewis X but increased clusters of differentiation 40 (CD40) expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes and significantly decreased C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) and very late activation antigen 4 (VLA-4) expressed on the surface of monocytes. Interestingly, subgroup analysis also found that RW significantly decreased circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) in Spain but not in other countries, and significantly increased αMβ2 (Mac-1) in the group that had an intervention duration of less than 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate consumption of RW is more effective than WW in alleviating atherosclerosis-related inflammatory markers in healthy people rather than high-risk subjects for CVD, but this needs to be further confirmed by studies with larger sample sizes.",

This case report highlights the challenges of diagnosing SWS when presenting with atypical features. Here, the authors present a 55-year-old man with an extrafacial port-wine stain and delayed-onset seizures, deviating from the classic triad. CASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old man presented with a recent seizure and a characteristic port-wine birthmark extending beyond the typical facial region. Neurological examination revealed no weakness, speech difficulties, or coordination problems. Ophthalmological examination didn't reveal glaucoma. Limited resources restricted access to advanced imaging like MRI scans. However, based on the constellation of clinical findings, including the facial birthmark with angiomatosis and the new-onset seizure, the patient received a diagnosis of SWS. Treatment with Levetiracetam was initiated to prevent future seizures, and patient education on managing diabetes and hypertension was provided. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: This case underscores the importance of considering SWS in diagnosing adult-onset seizures, especially with a characteristic facial birthmark. The delayed presentation and isolated seizure suggest potentially less severe brain involvement. Resource limitations necessitated a clinical diagnosis and treatment with readily available medications. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the challenges of diagnosing atypical SWS presentations. Early diagnosis is crucial for prompt management and improved patient outcomes. Future research should focus on developing robust diagnostic tools and exploring novel treatment options for atypical SWS presentations."

      "abstract": "Port wine stain (PWS) is a congenital vascular malformation that commonly occurs on the face and neck. Currently, the main treatments for port wine stain are pulsed dye laser (PDL) and photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, the efficacy evaluation of PWS mostly relies on the subjective judgement of clinicians, and it is difficult to accurately respond to many small changes after treatment. Therefore, some non-invasive and efficient efficacy assessment methods are also needed. With the continuous development of technology, there are currently many visualisation instruments to evaluate PWS, including dermoscopy, VISIA-CR™ system, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), high-frequency ultrasound (HFUS), optical coherence tomography (OCT), Photoacoustic imaging (PAI), laser speckle imaging (LSI) and laser Doppler imaging (LDI). Among them, there are simple and low-cost technologies such as dermoscopy and the VISIA-CR™ system, but they may not be able to observe the deeper structures of PWS. At this time, combining techniques such as HFUS and OCT to increase penetration depth is crucial to evaluate PWS. In the future, the combination of these different technologies could help overcome the limitations of a single technology. This article provides a systematic overview of non-invasive methods for evaluating treatment efficacy in port wine stains and summarises their advantages and disadvantages.",

      "abstract": "As estrogen-dependent breast cancer is more affected by the local production of estrogen via aromatase than serum estrogen, aromatase inhibitors for treating breast carcinomas in postmenopausal women have been developed. As the aromatase enzyme converts endogenous androgen to estrogenic compounds, its blockade lowers the in situ production of estrogen, demonstrated to encourage tumor proliferation. Red wine, but not white wine, may have aromatase-inhibiting properties that are being elucidated, although the exact mechanisms of action are not known. Polyphenols, tannins, and resveratrol have all been implicated as aromatase blockers, and there may also be synergistic interplay among selected constituents. The role of red wine would be in chemoprevention, the use of natural or synthetic substances to retard, block, or reverse cancer. One gene encodes aromatase, so aromatase inhibition would stop endogenous estrogen production. The role of aromatase inhibition in breast cancer in premenopausal women is not clear. While animal studies have demonstrated that red wine contains constituents that could block aromatase in vivo, the benefits also exist with nonalcoholic grape seed extract. Further investigation is needed but there are challenges in designing appropriate clinical trials for a substance as variable as red wine. While there is insufficient evidence to advocate for red wine as an aromatase inhibitor, there is sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation."

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to observe and analyze the clinical efficacy and safety of HMME-PDT in the treatment of PWS patients. It also aims to evaluate the usefulness of color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI), an ultrasound technique for detecting blood flow in skin lesions, in assessing clinical efficacy. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with PWS underwent HMME-PDT at our dermatology outpatient clinic between January 2019 and March 2020. Data on patient demographics, lesion location, lesion type (pink, purple, nodular thickening), treatment frequency, and pre- and post-treatment images were collected and retrospectively analyzed. CDFI was performed on three patients. RESULTS: All patients received intravenous HMME and underwent irradiation with 532 nm green LED light. Of these, 5 patients received 1 session of HMME-PDT, 14 received 2 sessions, 9 received 3 sessions and the remaining 5 patients received more than 3 sessions. Of the 33 patients, 9 were cured (27.27%), 10 showed improvement (30.30%), 11 experienced a reduction in symptoms (33.33%), and 3 showed no significant improvement (9.09%). Most patients reported local pain and oedema, and no systemic adverse effects were observed. Clinical efficacy correlated with lesion type and total number of treatment sessions. CDFI appears to be an excellent technique for assessing clinical efficacy. CONCLUSION: HMME-PDT is a safe and effective method for the treatment of PWS. CDFI examination appears to be a promising assessment tool. However, further validation with larger sample sizes is warranted."

Due to high maintenance costs and instable technology, alternative methods are needed. OBJECTIVES: To compare clinical outcomes of a variable-sequenced, long-pulsed 532-nm potassium titanyl-phosphate (KTP) laser and PDL on treating PWB. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, split-side study. Patients were treated with a KTP laser and PDL with 1 to 5 sessions at intervals of 6-8 weeks. A follow-up visit was scheduled 6 weeks post-treatment. Efficacy was evaluated through colorimetric analysis, area reduction measurements and clinical evaluations by two blinded investigators based on photo documentation. Subjects provided rating of pain intensity during treatment, post-treatment reactions and satisfaction. Safety was measured by adverse events. Maintenance issues of the laser systems were documented. RESULTS: A total of 35 patients (mean age 42.1 years) were enrolled. 63% were female. Patients received 2.4 (SD 1.4; 1-5) treatment sessions. Colorimetric analysis indicated a comparable clearance effect in PWB of both KTP laser and PDL. Independent investigators rated clinical appearance to be significantly improved compared to baseline. No significant difference was observed between both laser systems. Regarding post-treatment reactions, the KTP laser caused less swelling, purpura and crusts. 96% would recommend both treatment modalities. Patients were satisfied with both laser systems. During the study, PDL systems malfunctioned for 6.6 months in total. For the KTP laser, we did not observe any system failures. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that the KTP laser of the latest generation with large-spot sizes, subpulse technology and cryogen cooling has a comparable efficacy to the PDL in treating PWB. In addition, KTP laser is associated with greater tolerability, fewer technical failures and lower repair costs. Further prospective studies are required to determine the true effectiveness of the KTP laser in PWB treatment. This study was preregistered in Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05771298).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polygonatum sibiricum (PS) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) first recorded in Mingyi Bielu. The book documents that PS can nourish five internal organs, be taken for a long time, relax the body and prolong lifespan. Presently, PS is widely used in TCM to prevent premature graying of hair. Based on TCM theory and clinical trials, the wine steaming processed product from PS provides a better effect. However, no published study has elucidated the anti-aging mechanism. PURPOSE: The study aim was to investigate the anti-aging mechanism of PS and its wine steaming processed product in mice, specifically focusing on the effect of D-galactose (D-gal) surrounding the intestinal flora and the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2-antioxidant response elements (Keap1/Nrf2/ARE) pathway. METHODS: The chemical components in Raw PS (RPS) and Wine-steamed PS (WPS) were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS). An aging model using Kunming mice was established through intraperitoneally injected D-gal. Concentrations of RPS and WPS at 5, 10, or 15 g/kg/day levels were administered intragastrically, respectively. The body weight, liver and spleen indexes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), and malondialdehyde (MDA) activities in serum and brain tissue were recorded. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained brain tissue was histopathologically examined. The expressions of Keap1, Nrf2 and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) in the brain tissue at the mRNA and protein levels were respectively detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot (WB). Moreover, an Illumina Hiseq platform was used for 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) high-throughput sequencing to evaluate the proportions of intestinal flora in aging mice. RESULTS: The proportions of saccharides, flavonoids, and triterpene acids were different between RPS and WPS. In the aging model mice, WPS outperformed RPS in improving body weight and mental state by increasing the spleen index, SOD and GSH-PX activities, decreasing the liver index and MDA activities, and restoring the histopathological morphology in D-gal-induced aging mice. At the mRNA levels, RPS and WPS significantly reduced the expression of Keap1 and increased the expressions of Nrf2 and HO-1. The trend in protein expressions was similar to that of the mRNA results, and WPS had a stronger effect than RPS. Fecal microbiota analysis showed that RPS and WPS restored intestinal microbiota proportions to normal levels. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that PS and its WPS had a positive effect in relieving oxidative stress in aging mice. WPS outperformed RPS, which might be related to the activation of the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway and regulation of intestinal flora."

      "abstract": "Soil salinisation is an important abiotic stress faced in grape cultivating, leading to weakened plant vigour and reduced fruit quality. Melatonin as a novel hormone has shown positive exogenous application value. Therefore, this study used wine grape (Vitis vinifera ) 'Pinot Noir' as a test material to investigate the changes of foliar spraying with different concentrations of melatonin on the physiology and fruit quality of wine grapes in a field under simulated salt stress (200mmolL-1 NaCl). The results showed that foliar spraying of melatonin significantly increased the intercellular CO2 concentration, maximum photochemical quantum yield of PSII, relative chlorophyll and ascorbic acid content of the leaves, as well as the single spike weight, 100-grain weight, transverse and longitudinal diameters, malic acid, α-amino nitrogen and ammonia content of fruits, and decreased the initial fluorescence value of leaves, ascorbate peroxidase activity, glutathione content, fruit transverse to longitudinal ratio and tartaric acid content of plants under salt stress. Results of the comprehensive evaluation of the affiliation function indicated that 100μmolL-1 melatonin treatment had the best effect on reducing salt stress in grapes. In summary, melatonin application could enhance the salt tolerance of grapes by improving the photosynthetic capacity of grape plants under salt stress and promoting fruit development and quality formation, and these results provide new insights into the involvement of melatonin in the improvement of salt tolerance in crop, as well as some theoretical basis for the development and industrialisation of stress-resistant cultivation techniques for wine grapes.",

Only a few studies have reported the treatment of PPV, including a case using photodynamic therapy (PDT) to treat PPV-associated port-wine stains (PWS). OBJECTIVE: To investigating the efficacy and adverse effects of hemoporfin-PDT in PPV-associated PWS. METHODS: The efficacy and adverse effects in patients with PPV who underwent two sessions of hemoporfin-PDT from January 2019 to December 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty patients were included (13 females, 7 males, age range: 2-31 years; mean: 8.20 ± 8.92 years). Two, nine, seven, and two patients had PPV types Ia, IIa, IIb, and IIIa, respectively. After two treatments, the visual evaluation indicated the color of the PWS in 4, 5, 6, and 5 patients showed poor, fair, good, and excellent improvements, respectively. The combined good and excellent improvement rates in patients with PWS and pigmentary nevus overlapping in the same treatment area and in patients with PWS in the treatment areas only were 33.3% versus 87.5%, respectively, and were significantly different (p = 0.02). Minor side effects, such as edema, scabbing, hyperpigmentation, and blistering, were observed in some patients after PDT. CONCLUSION: Hemoporfin-PDT is an effective treatment for PPV-associated PWS. Patients with PWS and pigmentary nevus overlapping in the same treatment area showed poorer efficacy than patients with PWS in the treatment areas only.",

      "abstract": "A major concern for wineries is haze formation in white wines due to protein instability. Despite its prevalent use, the conventional bentonite method has shortcomings, including potential alteration of color and aroma, slow processing times, and notable wine wastage. Zirconium oxide (ZrO2) effectively removes proteins without affecting wine characteristics. However, producing cost-effective ZrO2 materials with efficient protein removal capabilities poses a significant challenge. This research aims to assess the viability of designing a porous material impregnated with zirconia to remove turbidity-causing proteins effectively. For this purpose, the support material alone (Al2O3) and the zirconia-impregnated support (ZrO2/Al2O3) were subjected to different calcination temperatures. It was observed that high-temperature treatments (750 °C) enhanced wine stability and protein adsorption capacity. The optimal adsorbent achieved a notable reduction in turbidity, decreasing the ΔNTU from 42 to 18, alongside a significant 44 % reduction in the total protein content, particularly affecting proteins in the molecular weight range of 10 to 70 kDa. This result is attributed to modifying the textural properties of ZrO2/Al2O3, characterized by the reduction of acidic sites, augmented pore diameters from 4.81 to 7.74 nm, and the emergence of zirconia clusters across the surface of the porous support. In summary, this study presents the first application of zirconia on the alumina support surface for protein stabilization in white wine. Combining ZrO2/Al2O3 and a high-temperature treatment emerges as a promising, cost-efficient, and environmentally sustainable strategy for protein removal in white wine.",

      "abstract": "The protein instability with haze formation represents one of the main faults occurring in white and rosé wines. Among the various solutions industrially proposed, aspergillopepsin I (AP-I) supplementation coupled with must heating (60-75 °C) has been recently approved by OIV and the European Commission for ensuring protein stability of wines. This study investigates the impact of AP-I either applied independently or in combination with flash pasteurization on the chemical composition of grape must and wines derived from Sauvignon Blanc and Gewürztraminer. The efficacy on protein stability of a complete treatment combining heat (70 °C) and AP-I (HP) was confirmed through heat test and bentonite requirement, although no differences were observed between must heating and HP treatments. However, high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of unstable pathogenesis-related proteins revealed that AP-I supplementation reduced chitinases and thaumatin-like proteins compared to the non-enzymed samples, with and without must heating. Amino acid increase was reported only in HP musts, particularly in Sauvignon Blanc. The concentration of yeast-derived aroma compounds in Gewürztraminer wines was increased by must heating; compared to controls, flash pasteurization rose the overall acetate esters content of 85 % and HP of 43 %, mostly due to isoamyl acetate. However, heat treatments -with or without AP-I- reduced terpenes up to 68 %. Despite the different aroma profiles, no differences were observed for any descriptor for both varieties in wine tasting, and only a slight decrease trend was observed for the floral intensity and the typicality descriptors in heated wines.",

      "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Gentiana radix (GR) and wine-processed Gentiana radix (WGR) have been commonly used in folk medicine for the treatment of bile or liver disorders, including jaundice, hepatitis, swelling and inflammation for thousands of years. However, the therapeutic effects of gentian root (GR) and wine-made gentian root (WGR) treatment on damp-heat jaundice syndrome (DHJS) have not been studied in animal experiments. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the protective effects and mechanisms of GR and WGR on DHJS in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a high-fat and high-sugar diet in a humidified hot environment, hepatic injury induced by giving alpha-naphthalene isothiocyanate (ANIT) in rats were used as a DHJS model. Histological analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), PCR analysis, and metabolomics were used to elucidate the mechanism of GR and WGR for DHJS. RESULTS: The results indicated that GR and WGR affected DHJS by inhibiting the release of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), direct bilirubin (D-BIL), total bilirubin (TBIL), total bile acid (TBA), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione S-transferase (GST) (P < 0.05). In addition, they significantly reduced the gene expression levels of Na+/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), bile salt export pump (BESP), multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 3 (MRP3) (P < 0.05). The WGR group improved the above function indicators better than the GR group. GR and WGR could restore 11 potential biomarkers in rats with DHJS tended to return to normal levels, these biomarkers were involved in arachidonic acid metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, retinol metabolism, arginine biosynthesis. The results of the metabolic pathway showed that WGR was significantly better than GR in the improvement of porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that treatment with GR and WGR has a beneficial effect on DHJS in rats, the major mechanisms may be involved in improving functional indicators of the body and endogenous metabolism, and WGR is more effective than GR. It provides important evidence for the clinical application of GR and WGR in the treatment of DHJS.",

Compared with free pancreatin, MPCTS@ PDA@ pancreatin displayed excellent thermal stability, acid resistance, storage stability and OTA detoxification in wine (>58%). Moreover, the MPCTS@ PDA@ pancreatin retained 43% initial activity after 8 reuse cycles. There was no significant change in the quality of wine after MPCTS@ PDA@ pancreatin treatment.

Based on the biological characteristics of port-wine stains and the advantages of microneedle transdermal administration, we intend to construct a nanodrug co-loaded with rapamycin (RPM), an anti-angiogenesis drug, and photochlor (HPPH), a photosensitizer, and integrate the nanodrug with dissolvable microneedles (MN) to achieve anti-angiogenesis and photodynamic combination therapy for port-wine stains. METHODS: First, RPM and HPPH co-loaded nanoparticles (RPM-HPPH NP) were prepared by the emulsification solvent-volatilization method, and its ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) was investigated under 660 nm laser irradiation. Mouse hemangioendothelioma endothelial cells (EOMA) were used as the subjects of the study. The cellular uptake behaviors were examined by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The cytotoxicity effects of RPM-HPPH NP with or without 660 nm laser irradiation on EOMA cells were examined by MTT assays (with free RPM serving as the control). Then, hyaluronic acid (HA) dissolvable microneedles loaded with RPM-HPPH NP (RPM-HPPH NP@HA MN) were obtained by compounding the nanodrug with HA dissolvable microneedle system through the molding method. The morphological characteristics and mechanical properties of RPM-HPPH NP@HA MN were investigated by scanning electron microscope and electronic universal testing machine. The penetration ability of RPM-HPPH NP@HA MN on the skin of nude mice was evaluated by trypan blue staining and H&E staining experiment. RESULTS: The RPM-HPPH NP prepared in the study had a particle size of 150 nm and generated large amounts of ROS under laser irradiation. At the cellular level, RPM-HPPH NP was taken up by EOMA cells in a time-dependent manner. The cytotoxicity of RPM-HPPH NP was higher than that of free RPM with or without laser irradiation. Under laser irradiation, RPM-HPPH NP exhibited stronger cytotoxic effects and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The height of the needle tip of RPM-HPPH NP@HA MN was 600 µm and the mechanical property of a single needle was 0.75048 N. Trypan blue staining and HE staining showed that pressing on the microneedles could produce pores on the skin surface and penetration of the stratum corneum. CONCLUSION: RPM-HPPH NP@HA MN can deliver RPM-HPPH NP percutaneously to the lesion tissue and realize the synergistic treatment of port-wine stains with anti-angiogenic therapy and photodynamic therapy, providing a new strategy for the construction of nanodrug-loaded microneedle delivery system and the clinical treatment of port-wine stains.",

There is growing evidence that shorter treatment intervals may play a role in more rapid PWB clearance; however, the optimal treatment interval has not been established. OBJECTIVE: To describe the outcomes of once-weekly pulsed dye laser (PDL) treatments for PWB in infants. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case series analyzed the medical records of patients with PWB who received once-weekly PDL treatments between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2023, at the Laser & Skin Surgery Center of New York. These patients were younger than 6 months. Before-and-after treatment photographs were independently assessed and graded 2 months after initiation of treatment. INTERVENTION: Once-weekly PDL treatments. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the percentage improvement of PWB, which was graded using the following scale: 0% (no improvement), 1% to 25% (mild improvement), 26% to 50% (moderate improvement), 51% to 75% (marked improvement), 76% to 95% (near-total clearance), and 96% to 100% (total clearance). RESULTS: Of the 10 patients (6 males [60%]; median [range] age at first treatment, 4 [<1 to 20] weeks) included, 7 (70%) had experienced either near-total clearance (76%-95%) or total clearance (96%-100%) of their PWB with once-weekly PDL treatments after 2 months. The other 3 patients all saw marked improvement (51%-75%) and subsequently went on to achieve near-total clearance with additional treatments. The median (range) duration of treatment and number of treatments to achieve near-total or total clearance in all patients were 2 (0.2-5.1) months and 8 (2-20) treatments, respectively. No adverse events were noted. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: This case series found that once-weekly PDL treatments for PWB in the first few months of life was associated with near-total or total clearance of PWB with no reported adverse events, suggesting improved outcomes can be achieved with shorter overall treatment duration. Further investigation into this novel decreased treatment interval of 1 week is warranted.",

Chemical analysis and sensory evaluation were conducted to assess the impact of ultrasonic treatment on wine quality. Results showed that ultrasonic treatment could increase total anthocyanin and total phenol content, reduce anthocyanin degradation rate, and improve color stability. Moreover, ethyl carbamate content was lower in the ultrasonic group after aging compared to non-ultrasonic group. A combination of 200 W for 20 min resulted in higher sensory scores and more coordinated taste, while a combination of 400 W for 40 min produced higher levels of volatile compounds (21860.12 μg/L) leading to a richer and more elegant aroma. Therefore, ultrasound can be used as a potential technology to improve the quality of wine.",

Color and histopathological changes were evaluated after combining Hemoporfin with KTP laser or LED light source of 532 nm at the same doses. Both PDT approaches could induce significant vascular injury and color bleaching. Although the use of the laser resulted in a greater vascular clearance, the LED showed more uniform distribution both in the beam profiles and tissue reaction and exhibited better safety.

For accurate treatment, varying light irradiance is required for different lesions due to the irregularity of vascular size, shape and degree of disease, which commonly alters during different stages of V-PDT. This makes quantitative analysis of the treatment efficiency urgently needed. APPROACH: Lesion images pre- and post- V-PDT treatment of patients with PWS were used to construct a quantitative method to evaluate the differences among lesions. Image analysis techniques were applied to evaluate the V-PDT efficiency for PWS by determining the Euclidean distances and two-dimensional correlation coefficients. RESULTS: According to the image analysis, V-PDT with good treatment efficiency resulted in a larger Euclidean distance and a smaller correlation coefficient compared with the case having lower V-PDT efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: A new method to quantify the Euclidean distances and correlation coefficients has been proposed, which is promising for the quantitative analysis of V-PDT efficiency for PWS.",

Its polysaccharide component has been gaining increased attention for its potential in nerve protection. While raw SC is the primary focus of current research, its processed products are primarily utilized as clinical medicines. Notably, limited research exists on the mechanisms underlying the effects of wine-processed Schisandra chinensis polysaccharide (WSCP) in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Therefore, this study seeks to assess the therapeutic impact of WSCP on AD mice and investigate the underlying mechanisms through biochemical and metabolomics analyses. The results demonstrate that WSCP exerts significant therapeutic effects on AD mice by enhancing learning and memory abilities, mitigating hippocampal neuronal damage, reducing abnormal amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, and attenuating hyperphosphorylation of Tau. Biochemical analysis revealed that WSCP can increase SOD content and decrease MDA, IL-6, and TNF-α content in AD mice. Furthermore, serum metabolomic results showed that WSCP intervention can reverse metabolic disorders in AD mice. 43 endogenous metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers for WSCP treatment of AD, and the major metabolic pathways were Ala, Glu and Asp metabolism, TCA cycle. Overall, these findings will provide a basis for further development of WSCP.",

      "abstract": "Conventional methods for inhibiting browning in wine are not suitable for cili (Roxburgh rose) wine, which is naturally rich in ascorbic acid and subject to restrictions on SO2 addition. In this study, the capacity of various additives to suppress the browning of cili wine caused by ascorbic acid degradation was investigated. SO2, pure reduced glutathione (GSH), regular inactive dry yeast (IDY), and IDY with various levels of glutathione enrichment (g-IDY) were separately introduced into cili wine following the completion of alcoholic fermentation. Over a period of 12 months, the color parameters, levels of ascorbic acid, phenolic compounds, antioxidant activity, and GSH content of the aged cili wine were analyzed. Among the investigated additives, g-IDY exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on browning. Moreover, adding 800 mg L-1 g-IDY increased the total reducing power and residual GSH content by factors of 1.52 and 2.44, respectively, with respect to those of the SO2-treated cili wine, thus enhancing its antioxidant capacity. Using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, a total of 22 monomeric phenolic compounds were identified. After g-IDY treatment, the contents of 15 easily oxidizable o-diphenols decreased, preventing the depletion of ascorbic acid as an antioxidant. As a result, the levels of ascorbic acid and total phenolics were 1.5-fold and 1.17-fold higher than those in the SO2-treated wine, respectively. This study demonstrates that g-IDY provides a new approach to preventing the browning of wine caused by ascorbic acid degradation. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Cili wine, characterized by its high ascorbic acid content, can decelerate cellular senescence and bolster immune function, which has contributed to its popularity. Ascorbic acid, a potent antioxidant, can be spiked into white wines to significantly enhance their antioxidative properties. Nevertheless, the high ascorbic acid content in cili wine renders it susceptible to oxidation under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, which alters the wine's hue from golden to dark brown, thus diminishing its commercial value. Overcoming this browning associated with ascorbic acid degradation is therefore of considerable importance and could facilitate the advancement of the cili industry.",

Preventing and delaying skin aging has become one of the prominent research subjects in recent years. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells derived from mesoderm with high self-renewal ability and multilineage differentiation potential. MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are nanoscale biological vesicles that facilitate intercellular communication and regulate biological behavior. Recent studies have shown that MSC-EVs have potential applications in anti-aging therapy due to their anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative stress, and wound healing promoting abilities. This review presents the latest progress of MSC-EVs in delaying skin aging. It mainly includes the MSC-EVs promoting the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, reducing the expression of matrix metalloproteinases, resisting oxidative stress, and regulating inflammation. We then briefly discuss the recently discovered treatment methods of MSC-EVs in the field of skin anti-aging. Moreover, the advantages and limitations of EV-based treatments are also presented."

In this study, a novel ultrasound technology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used with the aim of improving fermentation efficiency and volatile flavor quality of RW. RESULTS: The results showed that fixed-frequency ultrasonic treatment (28 kHz, 45 W L-1, 20 min) of S. cerevisiae seed culture at its logarithmic metaphase significantly increased the biomass and alcohol yield by 31.58% and 26.45%, respectively, and reduced fermentation time by nearly 2 days. Flavor analysis indicated that the flavor compounds in RW, specifically the esters and alcohols, were also increased in quantity after the ultrasonic treatment of S. cerevisiae seed liquid. Isobutyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl hexanoate and phenethyl acetate contents were increased by 78.92%, 129.19%, 7.79% and 97.84%, respectively, as compared to the control. CONCLUSION: Ultrasonic treatment of S. cerevisiae reduced fermentation time and enhanced the flavor profile of RW.

Hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME or hemoporfin)-mediated photodynamic therapy (HMME-PDT) has emerged as the first choice for PWB treatment, particularly for young children, in many major hospitals in China during the past several decades. AIM: To evaluate whether HMME-PDT is superior to PDL by comparing the clinical efficacies of both modalities. METHOD: PubMed records were searched for all relevant studies of PWB treatment using PDL (1988-2023) or HMME-PDT (2007-2023). Patient characteristics and clinical efficacies were extracted. Studies with a quartile percentage clearance or similar scale were included. A mean color clearance index (CI) per study was calculated and compared among groups. An overall CI (C0), with data weighted by cohort size, was used to evaluate the final efficacy for each modality. RESULT: A total of 18 HMME-PDT studies with 3910 patients in China were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Similarly, 40 PDL studies with 5094 patients from nine different countries were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Over 58% of patients in the HMME-PDT studies were minors (<18 years old). A significant portion (21.3%) were young children (<3 years old). Similarly, 33.2% of patients in the PDL studies were minors. A small proportion (9.3%) was young children. The overall clearance rates for PDL were slightly, but not significantly, higher than those for HMME-PDT in cohorts with patients of all ages (C0, 0.54 vs. 0.48, p = 0.733), subpopulations with only minors (C0, 0.54 vs. 0.46, p = 0.714), and young children (C0, 0.67 vs. 0.50, p = 0.081). Regrettably, there was a lack of long-term data on follow-up evaluations for efficacy and impact of HMME-PDT on young children in general, and central nervous system development in particular, because their blood-brain barriers have a greater permeability as compared to adults. CONCLUSION: PDL shows overall albeit insignificantly higher clearance rates than HMME-PDT in patients of all ages; particularly statistical significance is nearly achieved in young children. Collectively, current evidence is insufficient to support HMME-PDT as the first choice of treatment of PWBs in young children given: (1) overall inferior efficacy as compared to PDL; (2) risk of off-target exposure to meningeal vasculature during the procedure; (3) administration of steriods for mitigation of side effects; -and (4) lack of long-term data on the potential impact of HMME on central nervous system development in young children.",

The treatments included the control with no preservatives (C), the addition of green tea extract at 0.1 and 0.2 g/L (T1 and T2), and an SO2 treatment at 50 mg/L (T3). Five monomeric phenolic compounds were detected in the green tea extract used for the experiment, and their concentrations ranged in the order (-)-epigallocatechin gallate > (-)-epigallocatechin > (-)-epicatechin > (-)-epicatechin gallate > gallic acid. At the studied addition rates, these green tea-derived phenolic compounds contributed to ∼70% of the antioxidant capacity (ABTS), ∼71% of the total phenolic index (TPI), and ∼ 84% of tannin concentration (MCPT) of the extract dissolved in a model wine solution. Among wine treatments, T1 and T2 significantly increased the wine's colour absorbance at 420 nm, MCPT, gallic acid and total monomeric phenolic content. TPI and ABTS were significantly higher in wines with preservatives (i.e., T2 > T1 ≅ T3 > C, p < 0.05). These variations were observed both two weeks after the treatments and again after five months of wine aging. Additionally, an accelerated browning test and a quantitative sensory analysis of wine colour and mouthfeel attributes were performed after 5 months of wine aging. When exposed to excessive oxygen and high temperature (50 °C), T1 and T2 exhibited ∼29% and 24% higher browning capacity than the control, whereas T3 reduced the wine's browning capacity by ∼20%. Nonetheless, the results from sensory analysis did not show significant variations between the treatments. Thus, using green tea extract to replace SO2 at wine bottling appears to be a viable option, without inducing a negative impact on the perceptible colour and mouthfeel attributes of Sauvignon Blanc wine.",

Despite the progress made in laser therapy, a subset of patients continue to experience PWSs that cannot be resolved effectively even with PDL. A new long-pulse potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) laser with a trail of sub-pulses (Derma V, Lutronic, Seoul, South Korea) is a promising treatment for PWSs resistant to PDL therapies. This is a case of a female patient with PDL-resistance PWSs that was treated successfully with a long-pulse KTP laser. Long-pulse KTP appears to be not just more effective in treating PDL-resistant PWSs but also less costly as less number of sessions are needed, with no significant side effects reported such as purpura."

The valorization of renewable nutrient sources could improve the economic effectiveness of BC fermentation while their direct bioconversion into sustainable biopolymers addresses environmental pollution and/or resource depletion challenges. Herein a green bioprocess was developed to produce BC in high amounts with the rather unexplored bacterial strain Komagataeibacter rhaeticus, using waste streams such as wine distillery effluents (WDE) and biodiesel-derived glycerol. Also, BC was evaluated as a bio-adsorbent for phenolics, dyes and metals removal to enlarge its market diversification. RESULTS: BC production was significantly affected by the WDE mixing ratio (0-100%), glycerol concentration (20-45 g/L), type of glycerol and media-sterilization method. A maximum BC concentration of 9.0 g/L, with a productivity of 0.90 g/L/day and a water holding capacity of 60.1 g water/g dry BC, was achieved at 100% WDE and ≈30 g/L crude glycerol. BC samples showed typical cellulose vibration bands and average fiber diameters between 37.2 and 89.6 nm. The BC capacity to dephenolize WDE and adsorb phenolics during fermentation reached respectively, up to 50.7% and 26.96 mg gallic acid equivalents/g dry BC (in-situ process). The produced BC was also investigated for dye and metal removal. The highest removal of dye acid yellow 17 (54.3%) was recorded when 5% of BC was applied as the bio-adsorbent. Experiments performed in a multi-metal synthetic wastewater showed that BC could remove up to 96% of Zn and 97% of Cd. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrated a low-carbon approach to produce low-cost, green and biodegradable BC-based bio-adsorbents, without any chemical modification. Their potential in wastewater-treatment-applications was highlighted, promoting closed-loop systems within the circular economy era. This study may serve as an orientation for future research towards competitive or targeted adsorption technologies for wastewater treatment or resources recovery."

      "abstract": "Persimmon wine has various nutritional elements and high commercial potential. However, the high content of methanol, which is derived from the fruit's pectin, always hinders persimmon wine production. To reduce the methanol level in the wine, the effects of persimmon cultivar, starter, pectinase, and pretreatment methods were investigated via single-factor and orthogonal experiments. The persimmon cultivar 'MaoKui' was finally used throughout the study owing to its lowest pectin concentration (24.5 g/kg). The best treatment conditions against the persimmon pulp were pectinase (0.04 g/kg) at 30 °C for 4 h, then boiled at 115 °C for 15 min before fermentation started. The optimized fermentation conditions for wine production were pectinase (0.03 g/kg), 250 mg/kg starter (BO213 and SPARK with equal amounts), at 28 °C for 6 d. The obtained wine had 77.7 mg/L methanol and a 68.4% raw juice yield. The fruit wine had 111.4 mg/L methanol and a 90.6 sensory evaluation score. Forty-nine volatile aromas were identified. Ethyl acetate content was the highest, followed by 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2,3-butanediol, and lactate ethyl ester. The persimmon wine had a unique style with transparent color, elegant aroma, and pure taste."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol is often overlooked in primary care even though it has wide-ranging impacts. The Structured Medication Review (SMR) in England is a new 'holistic' service designed to tackle problematic polypharmacy, delivered by clinical pharmacists in a general practice setting. Implementation has been protracted owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study explores early patient experiences of the SMR and views on the acceptability of integrating clinical attention to alcohol as another drug linked to their conditions and medicines, rather than as a standalone 'healthy living' or 'lifestyle' question. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews with a sample of 10 patients who drank alcohol twice or more each week, recruited to the study by five clinical pharmacists during routine SMR delivery. RESULTS: SMRs received were remote, brief, and paid scant attention to alcohol. Interviewees were interested in the possibility of receiving integrated attention to alcohol within a SMR that was similar to the service specification. They saw alcohol inclusion as congruent with the aims of a holistic medicines review linked to their medical history. For some, considering alcohol as a drug impacting on their medications and the conditions for which they were prescribed, introduced a new frame for thinking about their own drinking. CONCLUSIONS: Including alcohol in SMRs and changing the framing of alcohol away from a brief check with little meaningful scope for discussion, toward being fully integrated within the consultation, was welcomed as a concept by participants in this study. This was not their current medication review experience."

      "abstract": "AIM: Diet, including foods and beverages, affects migraine. Conversely, the influence of migraine therapies on dietary habits is largely unknown. This study aimed at investigating the effects of triptan intake on foods and drinks consumed by adults with migraine with and/or without aura. METHODS: An exploratory questionnaire-based survey took place online between November 2022 and June 2023. Participants were recruited through advertisements shared on social media accounts (e.g., Facebook and Instagram) and seasonal newsletters of three Danish patient associations. In addition, posters and flyers in headache and pain centers at Danish hospitals and private neurological, pain, and physiotherapeutic clinics were utilized. RESULTS: A total of 314 adults with migraine with and/or without aura completed the survey. Among the respondents, 236 individuals (75.2%) regularly used triptans to treat their migraines. Compared with non-triptan users, individuals using triptans were characterized by significantly more foods and/or drinks triggering migraine (74.2% vs. 56.4%, p = 0.005). Alcoholic beverages and most specifically red wine were overreported as migraine triggers by triptan users (48.3% vs. 21.8%, p < 0.001). In the week preceding the survey, red wine was significantly less consumed by triptan users than non-triptan users (92.4% vs. 76.9%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who regularly consume triptans report red wine most frequently as a migraine trigger. Triptan users are characterized by a lower consumption of red wine than non-triptan users, suggesting that a regular triptan intake may promote an increased sensitivity to red wine-induced migraine.",

      "abstract": "Monoterpenes are typical aroma components in muscat grapes and wines, closely related to its geographical origins. However, the mechanism underlying the geographical differences of monoterpenes remains to be elucidated, especially in the Chinese viticulture regions. This study investigated the diversity of six Chinese viticultural vineyards (YT, XF, SS, XX, WW and CL) in the monoterpene composition of Vitis vinifera L. cv.'Muscat Hamburg' grapes and the resulted wines. Monoterpenes were analyzed by HS-SPME- GC-MS. The total amount of free and bound monoterpenes varied dramatically between grapes of different vineyards, and their contents were obviously higher in YT region grapes. The OAVs for 18 monoterpenes of grapes from the YT vineyard were relative higher than those of other regions, and the floral odor could distinguish grapes from different regions. The total free monoterpenes were highest in the YT region wine. Concentrations of total bound monoterpenes ranged from 711.13 μg/L (XF region) to 1078.30 μg/L (CL region). A correlation analysis showed that all monoterpenes showeda positive correlation with mean relative humidity, sum rainfall, and a negative correlation with sum duration of sunshine and mean temperature. This study would provide some new insights to understand the geographical differences of monoterpenes, and the results would facilitate the effective viticultural treatment of grapes to improve the quality of the aroma.",
