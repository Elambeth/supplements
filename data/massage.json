      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To systematically analyse the efficacy and safety of Tuina massage therapy for paediatric fever. METHODS AND RESULTS: A search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases, and it retrieved relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) up to November 2023. Fifteen trials (1,661 pediatric patients) were included, focusing on Tuina massage and tepid water massage. Studies were excluded due to: duplicate data, irrelevant types, incomplete outcomes and use of other interventions. The Cochrane RoB tool was employed to assess methodological quality, and the GRADE approach was used to evaluate the certainty of evidence. The review was registered with the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY), registration number INPLASY202270041, following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Massage treatment (120 min) showed a non-significant difference (standardized mean difference [SMD]: 0.68; 95% CI: - 0.31-1.67) compared with antipyretic medication. However, combining antipyretic medication and massage significantly reduced fever (SMD: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.50-1.30). Subgroup analysis indicated traditional Chinese Tuina massage significantly reduced pediatric fever (relative risk [RR]: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.26-0.65). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that traditional Chinese Tuina may be a promising adjunctive therapy for pediatric fever. Careful consideration of each child's specific conditions is necessary to ensure safety and comfort. Future research should enhance study design quality and broaden the scope of non-pharmacological treatment methods."

To evaluate the impact of manual and machine-based hand massage following laparoscopic cholecystectomy on pain, anxiety, and gastrointestinal function. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial study was conducted with 171 patients. Patients were divided into 2 intervention (manual hand massage and machine-based hand massage) groups (n=57), and a control group (n=57). Data were collected at 0, 4, and 8 hours postoperatively using the survey form, Numerical Rating Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Gastrointestinal Function Monitoring Form. RESULTS: The severity of pain in the manual hand massage group decreased statistically significantly after massage ( P <0.05). Anxiety levels in the intervention groups were lower at all time intervals postoperatively ( P <0.001). The severity of nausea in the massage groups was lower at 8 hours ( P <0.05). The number of bowel sounds at 8 hours in the massage groups showed a greater increase ( P <0.05). CONCLUSION: Both manual and machine-based hand massage positively affected pain, anxiety, nausea intensity, and bowel sounds following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Manual hand massage was more effective than machine-based hand massage in reducing pain intensity and increasing bowel sounds."

      "abstract": "Introduction The postpartum psychological well-being and quality of life of mothers after caesarean section are poor when compared to mothers following vaginal delivery. Therefore, the study aimed to evaluate the impact of a combination of back massage and affirmation relaxation technique on depression, anxiety, and stress experienced by mothers who had undergone caesarean section. Methodology This interventional study used a pretest-posttest control group design and was quantitative in nature. Twenty-four caesarean section mothers, with 12 in the experimental group and 12 in the control group, were chosen by a purposive sampling technique at Fatima Hospital, Mau, Uttar Pradesh, India, from July 1, 2022, to August 14, 2022. A structured questionnaire on sociodemographic data and a standardised tool, DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, 21 items), were used to gather the data. Data collection was done from the experimental and control groups on the 3rd and 6th post-operative days. The experimental group was given a back massage and affirmation relaxation four times a day for 10 minutes each on the 4th, 5th, and 6th post-operative days. The control group mothers received routine health assessment and health education on postnatal care and breastfeeding. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26 (Released 2019; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York). The analysis of categorical data was done using frequency and percentage distribution, whereas the analysis of continuous variables was done using mean and standard deviation. The Wilcoxon signed rank test and the Mann-Whitney U test were employed to evaluate the intervention's efficacy. The significance level was set at p < 0.05. Results A total of 24 mothers who have undergone caesarean section participated in the study. Baseline characteristics such as age, type of family, education, parity, type of LSCS, gender of the newborn, birthweight of the newborn, and timing of initiation of breastfeeding were homogeneously distributed in both experimental and control groups. Before intervention, the mean depression score of both the experimental group (8 ± 2.09) and the control group (8.50 ± 2.28), the mean anxiety score of the experimental group (11.67 ± 3.06) and the control group (11.50 ± 2.97), and the mean stress score of the experimental group (10.33 ± 3.17) and the control group (11.00 ± 2.63) were comparable. After intervention, there was a significant reduction in the maternal stress score in the experimental group (6 ± 2.83) compared to the control group (8.67 ± 2.31), which was statistically significant at p < 0.05. The anxiety score was also reduced after intervention in the experimental group (6.50 ± 3.53) compared to the control group (9.17 ± 1.99), which was nearly significant (p = 0.052). The mean depression score between the experimental group (6.50 ± 1.93) and the control group (7 ± 2.49) was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Conclusion The study findings highlight the potential benefits of affirmation relaxation and back massage for improving the psychological well-being of postpartum women who have had caesarean sections. The advantages of this mother-friendly, cost-effective method should prompt hospitals and health centres to incorporate it into standard postpartum care. Nursing students should also be taught about it as part of their midwifery education."

Effects of percussion massage therapy on neuromuscular recovery from eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2025-The aim of this study was to examine the effects of percussion massage intervention on neuromuscular function and performance recovery from eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Twenty healthy and physically active volunteers underwent an elbow flexion eccentric exercise protocol (6 sets of 10 repetitions with 80% of the concentric one-repetition maximum) with their nondominant arms. The indirect markers of muscle damage (muscle soreness, elbow flexion range of motion, upper arm circumference, elbow flexion isometric strength along with voluntary activation percentage, and resting twitch) were measured before, immediately, and 24, 48, and 168 hours after the eccentric exercise. The subjects were randomly assigned to either (a) percussion massage group (Percussion, n = 10): received 5 minutes of percussion massage treatment at the end of the eccentric exercise visit, the end of 24 hours, and the end of 48 hours after the exercise, or (b) control group (CON, n = 10): did not receive any treatment. Separate 2-way (time × group) mixed factorial analysis of variance tests were used to examine the potential changes of muscle damage indirect markers across time between groups. Significant main effects for time were observed in all dependent variables (p < 0.05); however, no interactions or group differences were found in any of these variables. Therefore, our study suggests that using percussion massage does not accelerate recovery after high-intensity muscle damaging eccentric exercise."

Massage can positively influence the physical and psychological outcomes of the ICU) patients. AIM: The study aimed to assess the perception of physiotherapists (PTs), physicians (PHs), and registered nurses (RNs) working in ICU about the possibilities and safety of implementing massage in the process of rehabilitation of ICU patients. METHODS: This multicentre survey was conducted in Poland in three ICUs (Gdansk, Koscierzyna, Krakow). A total of 135 people participated in the study. Of these, 25.9% (35/135) were PTs, 21.5% (29/135) were PHs, and 52.6% (71/135) were RNs. The questionnaires were distributed and collected online (directly by respondents to Google Form system) and in written form. RESULTS: Most PTs-71% (25/35)-perceive massage as a beneficial and safe treatment while working with ICU patients. PHs 96% (28/29) and RNs 92% (65/71) also recommend using massage by physiotherapists to rehabilitate ICU patients. In the respondents' opinion, the possibilities for the use of massage by PHs and RNs are lower (between 20% and 55%). CONCLUSIONS: According to the surveyed clinicians working in the ICU, massage is a safe form of treatment, especially when performed by PTs and it could be a permanent element of rehabilitation among ICU patients, especially for reducing pain, anxiety and restlessness and also improving sleep quality and bowel movement."

      "abstract": "Acupoint massage is a non-invasive traditional therapy that has demonstrated reliable clinical outcomes in pain management, mental health relief, sleep disorder regulation, gastrointestinal treatment, and as an adjunct therapy for cancer. Its convenience and cost-effectiveness further enhance its appeal. However, the existing English literature lacks a systematic review that encompasses the various forms of acupoint massage. The acupoint massage forms adaptability is particularly notable when considering the diverse conditions, it addresses, as well as its applicability across different age groups and gender differences. Providing a comprehensive understanding, it is crucial to outline common practices and explore specific applications in key areas. The comprehensive understanding can create opportunities for effective collaboration between preclinical and clinical studies. Defining and categorizing different forms of acupoint massage is essential, alongside investigating the neural circuits involved in touch sensation. Future efforts should enhance collaboration with modern biology, facilitating the transition from empirical to evidence-based practice. This review summarizes forms, applications, and mechanisms of mainstream acupoint massage and provides insights for future research and applications, promoting deeper integration into healthcare."

METHOD: A randomized controlled experimental design was conducted in private infant SPA and pediatric clinic centers in Van province from 29 June 2022 to 12 February 2023. A total of 72 infants aged 40 days to 4 months, born at term with a birth weight of 2500-4500 g and diagnosed with infantile colic (but not receiving prior treatment) were included. The infants were randomized into three groups: SPA, massage, and control. Stratified sampling and Random Allocation Software were used for randomization. Intervention groups received weekly treatment for 4 weeks, while the control group received routine nursing care. The infant SPA and massage application was applied once a week, for a total of 4 sessions within one month. Data were collected using the \"Infant Information Form,\" \"Infant Colic Scale,\" and \"Infant Colic Symptom Monitoring Form.\" Groups were compared regarding symptom frequency and crying duration. RESULTS: The groups showed no significant differences in demographic or descriptive characteristics affecting colic symptoms. The frequency of colic symptoms was significantly lower in both SPA and massage groups compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Additionally, the duration of crying associated with colic was significantly reduced in the SPA and massage groups when compared to the control group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Infant SPA and massage were effective in reducing colic symptoms. It is recommended to widely use these therapies, train parents in massage, and encourage SPA therapy for babies.

      "abstract": "Objective: This study was conducted to examine the effects of massage and foot reflexology on the sleep of premature infants. Materials and Methods: The research was designed as a randomized controlled experimental study. The study population consisted of premature infants born at 30-37 weeks of gestation who were admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of a hospital in the Central Anatolia Region. The sample included 108 premature infants divided into three groups: Massage group (n = 36), Foot reflexology group (n = 36), and Control group (n = 36). Data were collected using a neonatal follow-up form and actigraphy. Massage and foot reflexology interventions were administered to the respective groups twice daily (Morning: 07:00-09:00 and Evening: 19:00-21:00) for 15 minutes each session over two consecutive days, making up a total of four sessions. The control group received routine nursing care without any additional intervention. Pre-test (once) and post-test (once) measurements of 24-h sleep durations were assessed using actigraphy for all groups. Results: Sleep duration in the massage group increased compared to pre-intervention (251 minutes) and the control group (272 minutes), while the sleep duration in the foot reflexology group similarly increased compared to pre-intervention (268 minutes) and the control group (266 minutes) (p < .001). Sleep efficiency also showed a significant increase post-intervention, rising to 73% in the massage group and 71.8% in the foot reflexology group compared to the control group (p < .001). Furthermore, the number of awakenings and wakefulness duration significantly decreased in the massage and foot reflexology groups compared to the control group (p < .05). Conclusion: The findings indicate that massage and foot reflexology are effective non-pharmacological methods for improving sleep duration and sleep efficiency while reducing wakefulness duration and the number of awakenings in premature infants."

      "abstract": "Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of perineal massage during the second stage of labour in preventing perineal trauma in nulliparous women. Methods: A randomized control trial involving 104 nulliparous women undergoing vaginal delivery. The participants were randomised into two arms (intervention-group 'A' and control-group 'B') in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group had perineal massage and routine hands-on technique according to the hospital protocol while the control group received only hands-on technique. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of perineal tears during vaginal delivery, while the secondary outcome measures were the incidence of episiotomy during vaginal delivery, the mean duration of second stage of labour, and perineal pain score. Results: The baseline socio-demographic and maternal characteristics of the participants were similar in both arms. The incidence of perineal lacerations in the intervention group (massage group) was significantly lower than in the control group (27 (54%) vs. 40 (81.6%); p=0.003). Although the incidence of episiotomy (26% vs. 44.9%; RR = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.50-0.88; p=0.060) was not significantly different, mean perineal pain score at 4 h postpartum (4.3 ± 0.3 vs. 6.1 ± 0.50; p=0.03), mean perineal pain score at 24 h postpartum (2.2 ± 0.1 vs. 4.2 ± 0.3; p=0.02), and mean duration of second stage of labour (83.1 ± 17.5 min vs. 94.2 ± 18.9 min; p=0.002) were significantly lower in the intervention-group. There was no significant difference in the neonatal outcomes (head circumference, birth weight, and Apgar scores: p > 0.05) between the two groups. Conclusion: Intrapartum perineal massage significantly decreases the risk of overall perineal trauma, perineal pain, and duration of the second stage of labour among nulliparous parturients during the second stage of labour. Nulliparous women should be counselled on the potential benefits of intrapartum perineal massage, and obstetricians are encouraged to provide the technique to consenting women.

Infant massage therapy, as a nonpharmacological intervention, has been recognized as a potential strategy to mitigate these challenges. This study is aimed at evaluating the efficacy of infant massage therapy in comparison to standard care. Method: Participants were allocated into two groups: the intervention group (infants who received massage therapy) and the control group (infants who received standard care). Inclusion criteria were newborn infants with a postmenstrual age (PMA) of 30-36 + 6 weeks and a body weight of ≥ 1500 g. Infants with congenital anomalies, such as heart disease, congestive heart failure, lung and airway anomalies, other congenital anomalies, endotracheal intubation, and unstable vital signs, were excluded. The intervention group received massage therapy for 14 consecutive days, with sessions lasting 15 min each. Metrics for growth and length of hospital stay were collected. Results: Infants born with very low birth weight (VLBW) who received massage therapy exhibited significant weight gain, with an average increase of 63.04 g per day (95% confidence interval (CI): 11.72-114.35), significantly higher than the control group (p = 0.02). Additionally, the duration from birth to achieving full feeding was significantly reduced in the intervention group compared to the control group, with durations of 18.75 (± 10.86) and 41.88 (± 23.09) days, respectively (p = 0.01). Conclusion: Infant massage therapy significantly enhances weight gain and reduces the time to achieve full feeding in VLBW preterm infants. Moderate-pressure massage is recommended for stable VLBW infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs)."

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is exacerbated by dysfunction of inter-organelle contact, which depends on cellular responses to the mechanical microenvironment and can be regulated by external mechanical forces. Delivering dynamic mechanical forces to neural cells proves challenging due to the skull. Inspired by the effects of massage; here PEGylated black phosphorus nanosheets (PEG-BPNS), known for their excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, specific surface area, mechanical strength, and flexibility, are introduced, which are capable of adhering to neural cell membrane and generating mechanical stimulation with their lateral size of 200 nm, exhibiting therapeutic potential in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-te-trahydropyridine-induced PD mouse model by regulating inter-organelle contacts. Specifically, it is found that 200 nm PEG-BPNS, acting as \"NanoMassage,\" significantly increase  plasma membrane tension, as evidenced by fluorescent lipid tension reporter fluorescence lifetime analysis. This mechanical force modulates actin reorganization, subsequently regulating the contacts between actin, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum, further controlling mitochondrial fission and mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction in PD, exhibiting therapeutic efficacy via intranasal administration. These findings provide a noninvasive strategy for applying mechanical stimulation to deep brain areas and elucidate the mechanism of NanoMassage mediating inter-organelle contacts, suggesting the rational design of \"NanoMassage\" to remodel inter-organelle communications in neurodegenerative disease treatment."

      "abstract": "The MMA fight consists of 5 rounds of 5 min with minimal breaks between the rounds. The exertion load is excessive for the fighters, and the 1-minute breaks give little time for any intervention. This study aimed to examine the acute effects of two methods of regenerative strategies, ice massage and dry massage, and analyze their impact on Reactive Strength Index (RSI - m s- 1), muscles' biomechanical properties: muscle tone (T-Hz), elasticity (E - arb- relative arbitrary unit), stiffness (S - N/m), pressure pain threshold, (PPT - N/cm²), and compare their influence with passive rest. The maximum number of jumps (J - n) treated as an indirect effective measure of the interventions that were conducted was also recorded for each participant in each regenerative strategy. Thirty male MMA fighters took part in the study. Three subgroups of 10 participants (Ice massage, n = 10; dry massage, n = 10; and control, n = 10) were enrolled in the cross-over randomized clinical trial study design. The groups were randomized, and each group underwent each procedure (30 tested in each procedure). Five sets of jumps on a 50 cm box to exhaustion were used as a fatigue protocol with 1-minute breaks. The recovery interventions were performed during the breaks. The statistically significant results revealed in the post-exercise tests: RSI and number of jumps - the lowest decrease was observed in the massage group (p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001 respectively), the minor increases in T, E and S were also observed in the massage group ((p < 0.0001 for all measurements); the post-exercise PPT was the highest (higher means better) in the Ice group (p < 0.001). In every other parameter, the ice massage group showed slightly worse results than the dry massage group. Responder analysis confirms that the number of jumps profoundly impacted biomechanical variables, leading to increased muscle stiffness and tension, decreased elasticity and force endurance, and heightened pain sensitivity. Obtained results confirm that both dry and ice massage can significantly affect acute recovery following rounds of combat sport-related exertions. The Ice and Massage interventions differed in effectiveness - Massage was the most effective in preventing increases in stiffness and tension and preserving muscle elasticity. At the same time, ice cooling had a lesser impact, particularly on muscle elasticity changes but higher for PPT.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is a common condition among physically active individuals, often resulting in reduced performance and discomfort. Although percussive massage treatment (PMT) is widely used as a recovery tool, there is limited evidence supporting its efficacy compared to traditional methods such as static stretching. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of PMT on recovery from DOMS in physically active young men. METHODS: Thirty physically active male college students were randomized into three groups: static stretching (SS) group, a short-duration PMT (S-PMT) group, and a long-duration PMT (L-PMT) group. All participants performed squats to induce DOMS, followed by interventions of static stretching, 25 min of PMT, or 40 min of PMT, respectively. Measurements included the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, knee joint range of motion (ROM), countermovement jump (CMJ), and integrated electromyography (iEMG). These were measured at baseline (P0), post-DOMS protocol (P1), post PMT (P2), 24 h post-intervention (P3), and 48 h post-intervention (P4). Data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA or nonparametric tests, with multiple comparisons conducted at a significance level of p < 0.05. RESULTS: Compared with the SS and S-PMT group, the L-PMT group at P4 demonstrated significantly greater jump height (SS group: p < 0.001, d = 8.691; S-PMT group: p = 0.006, d = 4.37), peak ground reaction force (SS group: p < 0.001, d = 19.174; S-PMT group: p < 0.001, d = 14.334), and propulsion impulse (SS group: p < 0.001, d = 8.302; S-PMT group: p = 0.003, d = 4.517) during the CMJ propulsion phase. Additionally, the normalized iEMGs of the three muscles in the L-PMT group were significantly lower than those in the S-PMT (VM: p < 0.001, d = -5.692; RF: p < 0.001, d = -8.222; VL: p < 0.001, d = -10) and SS groups at P4 (VM: p < 0.001, d = -12; RF: p < 0.001, d = -11.384; VL: p < 0.001, d = -15). At P4, the L-PMT group exhibited significantly lower VAS scores than the SS group (p = 0.003, d = -1.53), as well as significantly greater knee joint ROM compared to the SS group (p = 0.012,d = 4.77). CONCLUSION: PMT was more effective than static stretching for DOMS recovery. Furthermore, two 40-min PMT sessions provided greater benefits than two 25-min sessions for treating DOMS. These findings suggest that PMT can be a valuable tool for physically active individuals seeking to enhance recovery and maintain performance. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov on September 21, 2024, with the identifier number NCT06612502.",

METHODS: A total of 106 patients who underwent thyroid surgery at our hospital between March 2023 and June 2023 were enrolled in this study. Patients diagnosed with postoperative hoarseness were randomly allocated into either the control group or the observation group using a computer-generated randomization table, with 53 patients in each group. The control group received standard postoperative treatment with neurotrophic drugs, while the observation group received additional acupoint massage therapy targeting Yuji and Zhaohai points. Subjective and objective voice parameters, cure rates of accompanying symptoms, and patient satisfaction were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: After treatment, both subjective and objective voice indicators improved significantly in the observation group compared to the control group (P < 0.01). The Voice Handicap Index (VHI) scores were lower in the observation group, with mean differences of Total score: 13.48 (95% CI: [10.89, 16.07], Cohen's d = 2.01); Function: 4.06 (95% CI: [2.39, 5.73], Cohen's d = 0.94); Physiology: 4.07 (95% CI: [2.56, 5.58], d = 1.04); Emotion: 3.48 (95% CI: [1.88, 5.08], Cohen's d = 0.84). Objective voice indicators also showed significant differences, with the observation group having lower Jitter (0.17, 95% CI: [0.13, 0.21], Cohen's d = 1.48) and Shimmer (1.05, 95% CI: [0.86, 1.24], Cohen's d = 2.13), and higher MPT (-5.21, 95% CI: [-7.26, -3.16], Cohen's d = -0.98). Additionally, the observation group had a significantly higher cure rate (96.2% vs. 16.98%), with RR = 5.67 (95% CI: [3.12, 10.30]), and higher satisfaction rate (98.1% vs. 84.9%), with RR = 1.16 (95% CI: [1.03, 1.30]). CONCLUSION: Early postoperative acupoint massage stimulation of thenar and Zhaohai points is conducive to the recovery of patients with hoarseness after thyroid surgery, improve the quality of patients' voice, and effectively promote the rehabilitation of voice.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXT: Those with chronic ankle instability (CAI) rely more on visual information to maintain postural control. Plantar massage and ankle joint mobilization are moderately successful at improving CAI-associated postural control impairments. Manual therapies may have a larger influence on the underlying sensory strategy used to maintain postural control, but their effect on these strategies remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of separate 2-week plantar massage and ankle joint mobilization interventions on estimates of visual reliance during single-limb stance in those with CAI and determine whether changes in visual reliance estimates were driven by concurrent changes in peripheral- or spinal-level sensorimotor function. DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial. SETTING: Research laboratory. PATIENTS: Sixty participants with CAI. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were equally randomized into plantar massage, ankle joint mobilization, and control (no intervention) groups. The manual therapy groups received six 5-minute treatments of their respective interventions over a 2-week period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: A percentage modulation outcome quantified an individual's reliance on visual information by estimating the weight given to visual information during eyes-open stance based on the magnitude of postural instability that occurs with vision removed. Secondary measures included joint position sense, plantar light-touch thresholds, and the H-reflex. Outcomes were captured before (baseline), immediately after (post), and 1-month (follow-up) after the 2-week intervention. RESULTS: Plantar massage resulted in significant percentage modulation changes in sagittal (P ≤ .046) but not frontal plane outcomes (P ≥ .069) relative to the control group. Joint mobilization did not alter percentage modulation changes (P ≥ .413). Significant correlations between percentage modulation changes and peripheral sensorimotor function were noted primarily at the 1-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: A 2-week plantar massage but not an ankle joint mobilization intervention alters sagittal plane percentage modulation values during single-limb stance in those with CAI. These changes may be driven by changes in peripheral sensorimotor function."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Trigger points can disrupt muscle activity patterns and cause cramping, fatigue, and weakening. Massage guns and myofascial release are widely employed for such circumstances, but their isolated outcomes are unknown. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of a massage gun versus myofascial release technique on subjective pain, pain pressure threshold and ankle ROM for 12 weeks in people with pain and latent trigger points in the calf muscles. METHODS: From December 2024 to November 2025, this assessor-blinded randomized clinical trial will enroll 60 patients with latent myofascial trigger points in the calf and equally (1:1) allocate them randomly to either massage gun (Group A) or myofascial release technique (Group B) at the Outpatient Service Unit, Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation, Jashore University of Science and Technology (JUST), Jashore, Bangladesh. Both groups will receive 12 sessions of massage gun or myofascial release on latent trigger points, with 20 min of ice once a week for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes are subjective pain severity by the visual analog scale and pain sensitivity by pressure algometry, while the secondary outcome is ankle dorsiflexion range of motion by an inclinometer to be measured at the baseline and 12 weeks post-treatment. The ethical approval and trial registration obtained prospectively, we will adhere to the International committee on harmonization good clinical practice (ICH-GCP) by confirming confidentiality, respect, voluntary participation and withdrawal rights of participants and justice. To ensure trial safety, the manageable and fatal adverse effects will be recorded and reported. RESULTS: Sociodemographic, clinical, and outcome characteristics will be collected at baseline after randomization. A non-experimental assessor will evaluate group treatments afterward. A data monitoring committee-appointed expert data analyst will compare and analyze the independent assessors' baseline and post-treatment outcome values. DISCUSSION: This study will address the research gap on isolated outcomes of newly addressed widely used massage guns and conventional myofascial release techniques on reducing subjective pain, and pressure pain threshold and improving ankle ROM for patients with pain and latent trigger points at the calf muscle. This single-centre study will indicate short-term outcomes with poor external generalization, but the study will help the clinicians in evidence-based practice and guide future multicenter studies with long term evaluations with a follow-up design.

      "abstract": "This pilot study investigated the effects of massage therapy on stress indicators in recreational horses, focusing on salivary cortisol levels, heart rate and conflict behaviors. Five recreational horses were analyzed under two experimental conditions: without and with massage treatments before riding sessions. Saliva samples were collected at four specific intervals in each condition to measure cortisol concentrations using an ELISA test. Observations of behavioral indicators and heart-rate monitoring complemented the physiological data. The results revealed that massage significantly reduced cortisol levels in saliva, with decreases averaging 526.6 pg/mL and 321.8 pg/mL during key sampling intervals. Behavioral analysis showed a notable reduction in conflict behaviors such as tail swishing, which decreased from 121 occurrences to 85 after massage. Relaxation behaviors, including relaxed lower lip and half-closed eyes, were frequently observed during massage sessions, further confirming its calming effects. These findings demonstrate that massage effectively alleviated stress in horses, providing practical benefits for their well-being and usage in recreational activities. The study underscores the potential of incorporating massage therapy into routine equine care to promote relaxation and enhance animal welfare."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Percussion massage therapy (PMT) integrates traditional massage with vibration therapy. This study examined the effects of adding PMT to a structured exercise program for individuals who underwent surgery after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. METHODS: A total of 24 individuals aged 18-40 were included in the study. Participants were divided into the PMT and structured exercise groups (SEG). The SEG group received a progressive neuromuscular exercise program, and the PMT group received the same structured exercise program and PMT. Range of motion (ROM) was assessed using the Goniometer Pro smartphone application, joint position sense (JPS) was measured goniometer, pain intensity was evaluated with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), functionality was assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), balance was measured with the Berg Balance Scale, quality of life was evaluated using the Short Form-36 (SF-36), and muscle diameter was measured via ultrasonography. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed in all parameters in both groups post-treatment (p < 0.05). The PMT group showed superior results compared to the SEG group in ROM, JPS (60°), pain, functionality, balance, and quality of life (particularly in the general health perception sub-parameter of SF-36) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that incorporating PMT, a novel approach in the literature, into the rehabilitation program following ACL reconstruction could be effective. PMT could be an alternative treatment method that can be used in conjunction with exercise programs in ACL rehabilitation. TRIAL REGISTIRATION: NCT06185231.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a rapidly growing global public health issue, affecting over 500 million people worldwide. Although abdominal massage has shown potential benefits in managing T2DM, its effectiveness remains unclear, particularly in animal studies, where challenges such as animal compliance and the need for precise pressure control complicate implementation. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel abdominal massage simulation device specifically designed for mice. This device provides a practical solution for conducting abdominal massage interventions in a controlled manner while minimizing stress and tissue damage to the animals. It securely restrains the mice's limbs, allowing them to remain conscious during the massage, and offers precise control over both the pressure and frequency of the massage applied to the abdomen. The device's ability to simulate manual abdominal massage with accuracy opens new possibilities for experimental studies assessing its effects on T2DM. The primary goal of this protocol is to investigate the impact of abdominal massage on key T2DM markers such as blood glucose levels, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity in mice. By providing a reliable and reproducible method for abdominal massage, this device can offer valuable insights into its potential as a non-invasive therapeutic intervention for T2DM. The findings from this research may contribute to advancing clinical strategies for diabetes prevention and treatment, particularly in enhancing the understanding of traditional therapies like abdominal massage in modern medical practice.",

      "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by joint inflammation, pain, and reduced mobility. Although pharmacological treatments, such as therapies with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologic agents, have improved disease outcomes, many patients continue to experience residual symptoms that impair their quality of life. This review examines the role of massage therapy as a complementary intervention in RA, focusing on its clinical benefits and underlying mechanisms. A systematic search of Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) up to February 2025 was conducted using relevant MeSH terms. Evidence from clinical studies suggests that massage modalities-including Swedish massage, aromatherapy massage, and foot reflexology-can reduce pain, improve joint function, and modulate inflammatory markers (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α) and cortisol levels, thereby promoting neuroendocrine balance and lymphatic drainage. Furthermore, massage therapy may offer additional benefits in managing comorbid conditions and enhancing psychological well-being. This review also underscores the pivotal role of nurse-led care in integrating massage therapy into comprehensive treatment plans, despite existing challenges in training and standardization of protocols. Future research with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods is essential to establish robust guidelines and optimize the use of massage therapy as an adjunct treatment in RA.",

Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 120 mothers of premature newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were assigned to three intervention groups (massage, n = 30; warm compression, n = 30; massage-warm, n = 30) and one control group (n = 30). Mothers in the massage group performed massage, those in the warm compression group applied compresses, and the combined group used both methods, whereas the control group used a breast pump with no intervention. Milk production was measured in milliliters (mL) after each pumping session over 4 days, and anxiety levels were assessed at baseline and on the 4th day. Results: Mothers with premature newborns in the NICU had mean breast milk amounts of 1,321.43 ± 569.01 mL in the massage group, 1,470 ± 718.93 mL in the warm compression group, 1,484.23 ± 889.28 mL in the massage-warm group, and 913.75 ± 679.90 mL in the control group. The massage, warm compression, and massage-warm groups had significantly higher milk production than the control group (p < 0.05). In addition, anxiety levels in the intervention groups significantly decreased compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Mothers reported satisfaction with all interventions, with no significant differences between the groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Breast massage, warm compression, and breast massage-warm compression can be suggested as effective, simple, and cost-effective methods for increasing milk quantity and decreasing maternal anxiety."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of oil massage as an adjunct therapy for neonatal jaundice during phototherapy. METHODS: A total of 160 neonates with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia were enrolled and randomly allocated into two study groups using a computer-generated random number table. Group 1 (Intervention Group) consisted of 84 patients who received both phototherapy and massage therapy, while Group 2 (Control Group) consisted of 76 patients who received only phototherapy. The intervention group underwent massage therapy three times daily for 20 minutes over two consecutive days. Transcutaneous bilirubin levels were measured every eight hours. Additionally, the total duration of phototherapy and the 24-hour stool and urine output frequency were recorded in both groups. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics between the two groups. However, stool frequency and urine output were significantly higher in the intervention group. The average duration of phototherapy was 19.4±4.17 hours in the intervention group compared to 28.4±6.58 hours in the control group (p<0.001). The rate of Transcutaneous bilirubin reduction was significantly higher in the intervention group during the first 24 hours. A rebound increase in bilirubin levels was observed at 40 and 48 hours in both groups after phototherapy was discontinued. CONCLUSION: Phototherapy combined with massage significantly reduced total bilirubin levels in newborns with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, making it a valuable adjunct treatment for the rapid reduction of bilirubin in neonates."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Interventions using vibration stimulation can increase the range of motion (ROM) without compromising muscle strength. Handheld percussive massage directly stimulates the focal area. Therefore, its effectiveness may be affected depending on the areas of stimulation. Thus, this study aimed to compare the effects of handheld percussive massage to different stimulation areas on shoulder internal rotation ROM and shoulder external rotation muscle strength and torque. METHODS: This crossover study included 15 healthy male volunteers (20.6±1.5 years). A 5-min percussive massage was applied to three posterior shoulder areas: the muscle belly, proximal muscle-tendon junction, and distal muscle-tendon junction. Internal rotation ROM (vertebral level and abduction position) and external rotation muscle strength (isometric and concentric) were measured before and immediately after the intervention and compared. RESULTS: Internal rotation ROM (vertebral level and abduction position) showed a time effect (P<0.05). No interaction or between-condition effects were observed. Post hoc testing showed a change in internal rotation ROM (vertebral level and abduction position) after intervention at the three stimulation areas (P<0.05). Muscular strength did not show any interaction, time, or between-condition effects. CONCLUSIONS: Handheld percussive massage therapy to various posterior shoulder soft tissue areas increased the internal rotation ROM without decreasing the external rotation maximum voluntary contraction torque."

      "abstract": "The objective of this study is to investigate massage therapists' knowledge, confidence, and awareness of domestic and family violence (DFV) in clinical practice. An online questionnaire methodology was used to collect data from Australian massage therapists who were 18 years or over. The study was open for participation for 6 months. The authors developed the questionnaire based on a previous massage therapy profession questionnaire; it included 64 questions in three sections. Two hundred and seventeen respondents formed the dataset. This study found respondents with prior experience of DFV were significantly more likely to have undertaken DFV training than respondents with no prior experience of DFV (p = 0.004). Almost two-thirds of respondents either strongly agreed or agreed that they would like some training to better understand DFV (n = 142, 65.4%) and to better understand their responsibilities around DFV (n = 149, 68.7%). Over half of the respondents were somewhat or very confident they would recognize the signs and symptoms of DFV (n = 126, 58.3%). Over half of respondents (n = 119, 54.8%) felt somewhat knowledgeable about DFV. The main theme from the qualitative analysis was absent resources. The subthemes were (i) without training I cannot help, (ii) prepare me, train me early, and (iii) support me with resources. This study concluded that there is a lack of resources and a deficiency in skills and knowledge among massage therapists to recognize and respond appropriately to domestic violence in clinic. Respondents indicated a desire to learn more about DFV in their practices as they deemed that without training, education, and resources they cannot provide the best of care for their clients."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy (CP) refers to a group of permanent neurologic disorders associated with injury to the brain during its development. The most common type of CP is spastic CP. Individuals with spastic CP commonly present with increased deep tendon reflexes, tremors, muscular hypertonicity, and weakness. Treatment aims to manage primary and secondary symptoms of CP and improve quality of life. Massage therapy has been shown to improve function and decrease spasticity in individuals with CP. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of massage therapy in increasing ankle mobility and decreasing spasticity in an adult with spastic CP. METHOD: A student massage therapist at MacEwan University administered five massage therapy treatments over 6 weeks on a 55-year-old female with spastic diplegic CP who presented with no active ankle movement and her ankles rigid in plantarflexion. The treatment goals were to obtain some ankle mobility and decrease spasticity in the knee extensors, which negatively impacted her ability to don socks and shoes. Progress was monitored using goniometry pre- and post-treatment to assess ankle mobility, and by administering the Modified Ashworth Scale prior to the third, fourth, fifth, and final sessions to assess spasticity. Techniques included static contact, effleurage, broad compressions, petrissage, muscle stripping, Golgi tendon organ release, muscle approximation, joint mobilizations, and passive range of motion. RESULTS: Ankle mobility increased, and slight active ankle dorsiflexion and plan-tarflexion were possible. Spasticity in the knee extensors decreased, but the change was not clinically significant. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that massage therapy may improve ankle mobility and decrease spasticity in an adult with spastic CP."

METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases, including Wanfang, CNKI, Chinese Biomedical Literature, VIP, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Studies were screened to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the efficacy of TCM combined with Tui Na for CS. The clinical curative effect was evaluated by analyzed the effective rate, pain level (Visual Analogue Scale, VAS), and Neck Disability Index (NDI) score. Pooled and sensitivity analyses were performed, and risk of bias was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. Compared to Chinese Message therapy alone, TCM combined with Tui Na exhibited a more pronounced reduction in VAS score (SMD: -1.72; 95% CI = [-2.57, -0.86]; I2 = 94.5%, P < 0.001) and also a significant improvement in NDI score (SMD = -0.61; 95% CI = [-1.78, 0.56]; P < 0.0001). The combined treatment resulted in a higher clinical efficacy compared to Tui Na alone (SMD: 0.87; 95% CI = [0.80-0.95]; I2 = 0%, P = 0.978), although the difference was not statistically significant. Quality of life were significantly improved in CS patients treated with combined therapy (SMD = 1.06, 95% CI = [0.03-2.09], P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Traditional Chinese medicine encapsulation combined with Chinese massage therapy is effective in treating cervical spondylosis, significantly reducing the pain levels and improving cervical vertebral function."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Friction massage (FM) is a conservative treatment for managing myofascial trigger points (MTrPs). Although many studies have demonstrated the effects of FM, this manual technique significantly loads the therapist's hands. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate FM compared to other physical therapy methods to help clinicians choose the best one. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to investigate the effect of FM on pain intensity, pressure pain threshold (PPT), and joint range of motion (ROM) in individuals with MTrPs. METHODS: PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar were searched from inception to 15 April 2024. All randomized control and clinical trials that assessed the effect of FM on pain intensity, PPT, and joint ROM in individuals with MTrPs were included. RESULTS: Twelve studies were included. The within-group results showed that FM could significantly improve pain intensity, PPT, and joint ROM, but compared to the control group, there was no significant superiority for improving pain intensity and PPT, and the results were inconclusive for the effect of FM on joint ROM improvement because of controversial findings. CONCLUSION: In the short term, there is level C evidence indicating that FM may effectively reduce VAS and the PPT of MTrPs in upper trapezius. Nonetheless, high-quality and long-term research is needed to address improvements in ROM and NPRS. Due to nature of level C evidence, future well-designed RCTs should overcome the existing limitations using adequate sample sizes, long intervention periods, and long-term follow-up.",

Sleep disorder can have serious detrimental effects on disease recovery. One of the simple and non-invasive methods to improve the sleep quality of these patients is use of complementary medicine interventions and aromatherapy massage is one of these methods that may help to improve their sleep quality. Therefore, this study explored the effect of aromatherapy massage with mint and sweet almond oils on the sleep quality of patients with traumatic brain injury in intensive care units. METHODS: This study was a randomized clinical trial. In this study, 60 patients admitted to the intensive care unit were assigned to the intervention and sham therapy groups. The hands and feet of patients in the intervention group were massaged for 20 min with a combination of mint and sweet almond oils for three consecutive days. In the sham therapy group, hands and feet of patients were massaged with Vaseline. Both groups completed demographic questionnaire and Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS ver. 22 via central tendency and dispersion indices (frequency, percentage, average, and standard deviation), the chi-square test, independent t-test, and paired t-test with a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: Aromatherapy massage significantly increased the sleep quality of traumatic brain injury patients in intensive care units, meaning that the mean score of sleep quality in the intervention group compared to the sham therapy group after the intervention showed a significant increase. (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of this study, the use of aromatherapy with a combination of mint oil and sweet almonds increases the sleep quality of traumatized patients admitted to intensive care units. Using a combination of mint oil and sweet almond oil to increase the sleep quality of patients similar to the research community can be helpful.

      "abstract": "Introduction Pain is a physiological and psychological response. For many people, it is a major problem that causes unpleasantness or aversion and reduces productivity in life. According to the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), pain is defined as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage\". Low back pain is commonly faced by each individual. Nearly everyone is affected by it at some point. A staggering 619 million people worldwide suffered from low back pain in 2020 (nearly 10% of the world's population), and by 2050, that number is expected to reach 843 million. The treatment options for low back pain are the same all over the world such as applying muscle relaxant ointments or sprays, resting the back for a while, avoiding heavy physical activities for a couple of days, applying heat or cold compress, etc. Objective The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of self-administered tennis ball massage therapy for low back pain. There are many benefits of massage therapy that show effective results. As an accepted part of many physical rehabilitation programs, massage therapy has also proven effective results for many chronic conditions, including low back pain, arthritis, bursitis, and fatigue. Low back pain is a common health issue that will affect eight out of 10 adults at some point in their lives. Although back pain is common, there are numerous effective methods to reduce muscle tension and provide relief. Methodology Pretest-posttest control group design was used, which included community-dwelling elderly individuals aged 60 years and above. Fifty participants in the experimental group and 50 in the control group were included in the present study. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethical Committee. The researchers conducted a survey in the community area and participants were included as per ageing factors for those experiencing back pain. Individuals with severe cognitive impairment, contraindications to massage therapy, having gone through a surgical procedure and long-term bedridden were excluded. Pain scores were assessed using the WHO Numerical Pain Rating Scale (0: No pain, 1-3: Mild pain, 4-6: Moderate pain, 7-10: Severe pain) (see Appendices). In the primary stage pretest pain assessment was done and the next day onwards tennis ball massage was administered to the experimental group of geriatric individuals. On the sixth day, the posttest pain assessment was done. Result On day 1 (pre-test), before giving tennis ball massage therapy on low back pain, mean = 6.34, S.D. = 0.9606 in the experimental group. On day 6 (post-test), after giving tennis ball massage therapy on low back pain, mean = 2.84, S.D. = 0.8417 in the experimental group, and t = 23.9505 and p = 0.00001. Hence the result shows that the tennis ball massage is effective in reducing low back pain. Conclusion Since the test is statistically significant according to the pre-test and post-test in the experimental group at the 5% level of significance, the null hypothesis is rejected because the p-value for this comparison is smaller than 0.05. This indicates that self-administered tennis ball massage therapy is significantly effective for lower back pain."

      "abstract": "Background: The Caring Massage® (CM) consists of nurse-patient physical and mental contact. It promotes empathetic presence and emotional closeness and strengthens trust and safety in the nurse-patient relationship. However, previous studies have underexplored and under-evaluated its effectiveness on different body areas. This study aimed to identify the body areas to be treated and assess CM's influence on the nurses performing it and patients receiving it. Method: A Delphi study was conducted to gather expert opinions on Caring Massage®. A preliminary list of body areas and variables influenced by CM was developed from a literature review and submitted to panelists to identify outcomes, achieving an acceptable content validity rate. Patient and nurse variables as influenced by CM were categorized into \"Bio-Physiological Outcomes\" (BPOs), \"Psychological Outcomes\" (POs), and \"Sociological Outcomes\" (SOs). Two Delphi rounds were conducted between July and October 2024. Results: A total of 86 panelists were recruited, who identified 58 variables (7 body areas, 29 patient variables, and 22 nurse variables). Feet, legs, back, hands, shoulders, and arms were identified as key CM treatment areas. Patient outcomes identified as highly influenced by receiving CM were quality of sleep (BPO), emotional well-being (PO), and nurse-patient relationship (SO). Nurse outcomes highly influenced by performing CM were physical well-being (BPO), body respect (PO), and consideration of the patient as a person (SO). Conclusion: Caring Massage® influences multiple aspects concerning both the patients receiving it and nurses performing it. This study addressed the heterogeneity observed in the literature, providing a foundation for future studies and encouraging further investigations."

Results: After 12 weeks of intervention, the FHA, FSA, VAS, and NDI of the experimental group were significantly lower than those of the pre-intervention group (p < 0.05) and significantly lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05); the extension and left-right rotation cervical spine ROM of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the pre-intervention group (p < 0.05) and significantly higher than those of the control group (p < 0.05); and sEMG indexes (mean power frequency and median frequency) of the upper trapezius and the pectoralis major in the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the pre-intervention group (p < 0.05) and significantly higher than the control group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Compared with Pilates training alone, Pilates training combined with fascial massage demonstrated a more significant effect in improving muscle activation, body posture, and pain and enhancing the quality of life for patients with UCS."

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) worsens the quality of life for people with cancer. Massage therapy involves neuromuscular modulations and can potentially reduce CIPN symptoms. We examined the immediate improvements in CIPN-related pain and neuropathy following massage therapy among patients with CIPN. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort, we assessed patients who received 1 massage therapy session for CIPN symptom relief during or after chemotherapy at a National Cancer Institute-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center from October 2017 to September 2022. We measured the severity of pain and neuropathy before and after massage therapy with a 4-item verbal rating scale (VRS) or a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale (NRS). We converted NRS to VRS scores and examined the pre-post differences in symptom severity using the Wilcoxon rank test. RESULTS: Among 23 patients (median [range] age 64 [4-85] years, female 74%, White 70%), one session of massage therapy decreased the percentage of patients reporting moderate-to-severe pain from 81% at baseline to 0% (none) post-massage; percentage of patients reporting neuropathy also reduced from 77% at baseline to 12% following treatment. The pre-post differences were statistically significant for both pain (mean: -1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.9 to -1.2; P = .001) and neuropathy scores (mean: -1.2, 95%CI -1.4 to -0.9; P < .0001). CONCLUSION: Among cancer patients with CIPN, one session of massage therapy was associated with immediate neuropathy and CIPN pain relief reported by patients following treatment. However, this preliminary finding requires further rigorous verifications in future randomized controlled clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of rhythmic embrocation (RE), a massage technique, on postoperative stress levels (measured by heart rate variability) in colorectal cancer surgery patients compared to empathic conversation. METHODS: The study included 68 patients who were randomized into three groups: one received RE from professionals, another from students, and the third received empathic conversations. Stress was quantified using heart rate variability before and after the interventions. RESULTS: The standard deviation of the heartbeat intervals (SDNN) increased more in the professional RE group 9.12 ms (IQR 3.59-12.3 ms) than in the other groups: student RE group 5.68 ms (-0.66-7.5 ms), empathic conversation group 6.64 ms (-1.49-7.38 ms); hence stress decreased more in the professional RE group, although not statistically significant (p= 0.21). Other factors like sleep quality, nausea, pain, and mood did not differ significantly between the groups. No complications were associated with the interventions. CONCLUSION: RE was safe and a statistically significant superiority of RE on postoperative stress compared to empathic conversations could not be found. Due to high inter- and intraindividual variability a clear pattern of response of the secondary outcomes to RE in comparison to empathic conversations could not be found. The study was limited by a small sample size, high patient variability, effective co-interventions for sleep, pain and nausea, and by an imbalance between groups. The study indicates that future research on RE should focus on a more narrowly defined patient population, increase the sample size, and select comparison groups that are clearly distinct from each other as well as a clinical context with fewer confounding factors. Furthermore, the patient's preferences and previous experiences with massage therapy should be considered.

OBJECTIVE: This study compared the effects of percussion massage therapy (PMT), kinesiology tape (KT), and dynamic stretching (DS) on shoulder strength, proprioception, and functionality. METHODS: The KT group had kinesiology tape applied to the deltoid muscles. The DS group performed dynamic stretching in flexion and abduction. The PMT group received percussion massage on the deltoid muscles. Assessments included the Becure system for joint position sense (JPS), the Timed Functional Arm and Shoulder Test (TFAST), and a hand-held dynamometer for muscle strength. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed in almost all JPS parameters for all groups (p < 0.05). Total TFAST scores improved in all groups. Muscle strength significantly improved in the DS group (p < 0.05), while PMT and KT groups showed no significant change (p > 0.05). Statistically significant differences were found between the groups (p < 0.05). JPS 30°, 60°, and 90° flexion parameters had effect sizes of 0.51, 0.64, and 0.49, respectively; JPS 30°, 60°, and 90° abduction parameters had effect sizes of 0.38, 0.46, and 0.45, respectively. The effect size for Total TFAST was 0.55, flexion muscle strength 0.59, and abduction muscle strength 0.68. DS was more effective for muscle strength, DS and PMT for functionality, and KT and PMT for proprioception (p < 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: PMT and KT were more effective for proprioception, PMT and DS were more effective for functionality, and DS was most efficient in enhancing muscle strength."

The prevalence of depression is high in adolescents, who are hypersensitive to chronic stress. Traditional pediatric massage (TPM) can effectively relieve depression. In this study, we investigated the action mechanism of TPM on preventing depression-like behaviors in adolescent rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). In this investigation, we employed several behavioral tests and detections, including western blotting, immunofluorescence staining and RT-qPCR. The findings of this study demonstrated that TPM had an effectively antidepressant effect, maintained microglia polarization homeostasis and resisted neuroinflammation in the hippocampus in CUMS-exposed adolescent rats. With the treatment of picropodophyllin, the inhibitor of IGF-1 receptor, the antidepressant effect of TPM was blocked, along with inhibited IGF-1/Nrf2 pathway which were closely related with anti-inflammatory and anti-ferroptosis actions. The results suggest that TPM enhanced the resilience of adolescent rats to CUMS and exerted an antidepressant effect partially via activating IGF-1/Nrf2 pathway.",

      "abstract": "Background and objective Iliotibial band tightness (ITBT) is a common knee injury that usually presents with pain and tenderness on palpation of the lateral aspect of the knee, superior to the joint line and inferior to the lateral femoral epicondyle. Athletes with ITBT typically complain of a sharp or burning pain roughly 2 cm superior to the lateral joint line. The pain may radiate proximally or distally, and in less severe cases, the pain may quickly subside upon cessation of activities. New approaches such as percussive massage therapy are used to relax the muscle tissue, reduce discomfort, and improve blood flow. It involves the use of handheld percussion devices to apply rapid vibrations and percussions to the skin and underlying soft tissue. This study aimed to examine the immediate effectiveness of percussive massage therapy on the responsiveness of pain and range of motion (ROM) in field athletes. Methodology Fifty athletes between the ages of 20 and 35 years were recruited for the study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The immediate effectiveness of percussive massage therapy (Caresmith Massage Gun, Caresmith, Mumbai, India) was assessed based on the pre-treatment and post-treatment pain levels measured on the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) score and ROM of hip abduction and knee flexion. Results The results indicated a significant decrease in post-treatment pain, with the mean NPRS score decreasing from 5.18 to 2.60 immediately following the session. While the majority of participants experienced a decrease in NPRS scores, a few reported no change. The t-test for the right hip abduction ROM demonstrated a significant group effect (p<0.001). The t-test for the right knee flexion ROM also demonstrated a significant group effect (p<0.001). Conclusions The current study indicates that the majority of the field athletes showed a positive response to percussion massage therapy in terms of pain and ROM."

Women typically use a number of coping strategies, including both pharmaceutical and non-pharmacological, or more natural, techniques, to minimize labor discomfort. \"Non-pharmacological coping strategies\" refers to methods other than using medications to alleviate labor pain. OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted to correlate birthing ball exercise and sacral massage on maternal and fetal well-being among prim parturient women. METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was adopted. A total of 300 primigravidae with 150 each in the experimental and control groups were selected by purposive sampling. Primigravidae in the experiment group underwent birthing ball exercises and sacral massage during their active phase of labor. The control group received routine hospital standard care. The Visual Analog Pain Scale, GAD-7 Anxiety Severity Scale, Apgar score, and Rating scale on Satisfaction were used to collect the data. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the collected data. RESULTS: The findings of the study showed that the mutual correlation coefficients of the level of satisfaction, pain perception, anxiety, cervical dilatation, uterine contraction, and fetal heart rate of the control group post-test-2 are given. CONCLUSION: As a non-pharmacological intervention, the birthing ball technique and sacral massage are necessary to decrease pain perception and reduce anxiety level, which will increase cervical dilatation."

METHODS: A total of 120 children with asthma in remission who were treated in the paediatric outpatient department between January 2016 and October 2022 were randomly divided into the experimental and control groups, with 60 patients in each group. The patients in both groups were treated with salmeterol and fluticasone inhalation powder, 1 puff each time, twice a day. The patients in the control group received acupoint massage in addition to this treatment, with acupoint massage performed once a day, Monday to Friday, lasting 30 min each time. The patients in the experimental group received ear point pressing beans in addition to the treatment in the control group. Ear point press bean paste bean once a week,press 3-5 times a day,press each point for i minute. Changes in pulmonary function and asthma control were observed before and after treatment in both groups, with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced expiratory vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC ratio and the Asthma Control Test (ACT) score compared. RESULTS: After 8 weeks of treatment, FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC ratio and the ACT scores of both groups improved to different degrees (P<0.05). In terms of the effective control rate, the total clinical effective control rate (95 %) of patients in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group (81.67 %) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupoint massage combined with ear point pressing beans has a good effect on the treatment of asthma remission and can effectively improve the quality of life, making it worthy of further promotion in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND AIM:  Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a prevalent mental health condition characterized by excessive, often uncontrollable anxiety, frequently accompanied by autonomic dysfunction symptoms. The gut-microbiota-brain axis is implicated in its pathogenesis. Traditional Chinese medicine therapies, including abdominal massage, are increasingly being considered for GAD treatment. This study is designed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of abdominal massage for GAD and its influence on patients' gut microbiota. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  A prospective, assessor-blinded, single-center randomized controlled trial involving 70 GAD patients, randomly allocated to either a combined abdominal massage and medication group or a medication-only group will be conducted. An additional 35 healthy individuals will serve as normal controls. RESULTS:  The primary outcome measure will be the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) score pre- and post-treatment. Participants will undergo electroencephalogram (EEG) assessments and provide stool samples for gut microbiota evaluation. Differences between GAD patients and healthy controls will be compared, and changes in the two GAD groups pre- and post-treatment will be monitored. Subsequently, the correlation between EEG findings, gut microbiota, and clinical efficacy in GAD patients will be analyzed. CONCLUSION:  This study seeks to confirm the therapeutic benefits of abdominal massage for GAD and offer preliminary insights into its underlying mechanisms. Changes in these indicators before and after treatment in both the treatment and control groups will be examined to clarify the potential mechanisms by which abdominal massage may benefit GAD patients. Abdominal massage is hypothesized to alleviate clinical symptoms in GAD patients by modulating the gut-brain axis. If our hypothesis is validated, abdominal massage could emerge as a new alternative treatment for GAD and offer fresh insights into the mechanisms underlying massage therapy. The study's findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications."

DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature search was conducted on databases ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EBSCO and PubMed. METHODS: The Modified Jadad scale was used. The statistical analysis was conducted using the Stata 15.0 software, with the aim of evaluating heterogeneity between studies using both chi-square and I2 statistics. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using both the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool and statistical tests. A funnel plot was used to detect potential publication bias, which is indicated by an asymmetry in the plot. The Egger regression test was also performed to evaluate publication bias. RESULTS: Twelve studies were selected for the meta-analysis. All studies included in this meta-analysis were of good quality. In the subgroup analysis, it was determined that massage and acupressure reduced the severity of restless legs syndrome as a result of the intervention, while reflexology had no effect. Interventions did not affect the sleep quality of patients. Restless legs syndrome severity was significantly reduced in studies using oil and in studies that intervened for more than 15 min per session. CONCLUSION: Interventions applied to haemodialysis patients with restless legs syndrome can reduce the severity of restless legs syndrome. It is recommended to conduct randomised controlled trials that determine the effects of methods on restless legs syndrome severity and sleep quality in haemodialysis patients.",

In the present study Traditional Thai Massage (TTM) has been compared with Ultrasound therapy (US) for treating PHP. METHODS: Sixty PHP patients with a Myofascial Trigger Point (MTrP) present in the calf were randomly assigned to receive a 40-minute single treatment of either US or TTM. Pain Intensity (VAS), Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT), Ankle Dorsiflexion Range of Motion (DROM), and Foot Skin Temperature (FST), were measured before, immediately after, and 24 h after treatment. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, both groups showed a significant reduction in pain intensity immediately (CVAS) and 24 h after treatment (MVAS24) (p < 0.01), as well as a significant increase in PPT of the heel immediately after treatment (p < 0.05). However, only the US treatment group showed an increase in PPT in the calf immediately after treatment (p < 0.05). Furthermore, only the US group showed a significant increase in DROM immediately and 24 h after treatment (p < 0.001). The reduction in CVAS and increase in DROM immediately (p < 0.05) and 24 h after treatment (p < 0.01) were significantly greater in the US than the TTM group. CONCLUSIONS: The significant efficacy of US with stretching for providing pain relief in the treatment of PHP is confirmed. For the first time, TTM has also been demonstrated to be effective in providing pain relief for patients with PHP and may have a potentially useful complementary role, in treating PHP.

BACKGROUND: Agitated behaviour is the most common behavioural symptom in patients with dementia and can seriously affect the health status and quality of life of individuals with dementia and their caregivers. Massage and touch have been widely used as a non-pharmacological intervention to address the behavioural issues of dementia. However, current research findings on the effects of massage and touch on agitation in people with dementia are inconsistent. DESIGN: A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. METHODS: This meta-analysis complied with PRISMA guidelines, and relevant literature up to January 2024 was systematically retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Clinical Trials Registry, Cochrane Library and four Chinese databases. Statistical evaluations were performed utilising Review Manager 5.4, and the included studies' bias risks were assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration tool. RESULTS: Seventeen randomised controlled trials involving 980 patients with dementia were included. The results of the meta-analysis showed that massage and touch could ameliorate agitation and behaviour problems in dementia. Subgroup analyses based on massage type showed that hand, head and foot massage significantly improved agitation. Massage and touch for ≤ 4 weeks were more effective in reducing agitated behaviour than those for > 4 weeks. Furthermore, subgroup analysis revealed that massages and touch were more effective for individuals with less severe dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Massage and touch in the short term can effectively improve agitation in dementia patients, while hand, head and foot massage can effectively reduce agitation. Thus, clinical nursing staff and caregivers of individuals should be actively helped to apply massage and touch to their patients. However, more studies are needed to validate our results before we can give a more definitive recommendation. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study suggests that massage and touch can be used as complementary treatments for agitation in people with dementia and encourages nursing staff and caregivers to apply massage and touch to better cope with the agitated behaviour of older adults with dementia. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: No patient or public contribution. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024507133.",

[Participants and Methods] Eighteen healthy males (age, 22-63 years; height, 161.5-181.5 cm) were recruited. The skin-to-bone distance at Points A (fifth rib, near acupoint BL43) and B (eighth rib, near acupoint BL46) was measured using ultrasonography in the prone and seated positions. In the prone position, the participants laid on a bed with their shoulders abducted at 90°, and in the seated position, a commercial massage chair was used. [Results] The mean distance at Point A in the prone position was 2.7 ± 0.4 cm (range, 1.9-3.4 cm). The mean distance at Point B was lower than that at Point A in the prone and seated positions, with no significant difference in the distance between the two positions. [Conclusions] The skin-to-bone distance in the interscapular region did not differ significantly when measured in the seated and prone positions. Tissue components in some anatomical areas change with posture, whereas others do not. Further studies on posture-induced changes to tissue components are necessary to improve understanding of these variations."

Relaxation massage aims to alleviate psychophysiological tension, enhance both blood and lymphatic circulation, and promote mental and physical relaxation. It is particularly beneficial for those with anxiety-related symptoms (such as generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety) and sleep disorders, aiming to improve calmness and promote sleepiness. Aims: The purpose of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of a single session of relaxation massage prior to bedtime on sleep quality and quantity indices in individuals with symptoms of chronic insomnia. Methods: In total, 20 (N = 20) healthy individuals (aged 25.5 ± 12.0 years; 6F/14M) with a score on the Athens Insomnia Scale of ≥16 participated under three different conditions over one week apart: (1) a 45 min relaxation massage condition (REL), (2) a 45 min sham massage condition (PLA), and (3) a control condition with no massage. Sleep activity was monitored using a portable polysomnographic system. Results: A statistically significant effect was observed between sleep efficiency across the three sessions (p = 0.034), with a notable effect in the relaxation massage (REL) session (p = 0.045). Additionally, sustained sleep efficiency showed a statistically significant difference among the sessions (p = 0.005). Conclusions: Relaxation massage prior to bedtime could be used as an effective and safe non-pharmacological approach for improving sleep efficiency and potentially restoring the fragmented sleep of individuals with symptoms of insomnia.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Health education, weight control and exercise therapy are recognised treatment options for the non-surgical management of knee osteoarthritis (KOA); however, the pain and muscle fatigue associated with exercise make it difficult for patients to initially adhere. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) massage is an important complementary and alternative therapy that can effectively address these deficiencies. According to TCM theory and preliminary clinical practice, loosening of the muscles while pointing to acupoints can promote the recovery of KOA. Therefore, we hypothesised that exercise therapy in conjunction with TCM massage may lead to more satisfactory results in terms of pain management, active functional muscle activation patterns and proprioception in patients with KOA. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A parallel, single-centre, randomised controlled trial involving 106 patients will be conducted at Shuguang Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Eligible patients with KOA who agree to participate will be randomised via a 1:1 randomisation system into the experimental group (receiving TCM massage and exercise treatment) and the control group (receiving exercise treatment). The primary endpoint is the change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) for pain from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes include knee function (measured using the WOMAC stiffness and WOMAC functional subscale questionnaire and the timed 'Up and Go' test), muscle activation states (evaluated with electromyography techniques), knee proprioception and treatment satisfaction, adherence, safety evaluation and other relevant factors. Outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded to the allocations, and the participants will not disclose their specific allocations. Outcome analyses will be conducted on both intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. A preliminary analysis will test whether TCM massage, in addition to exercise, has statistically better outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol has received approval from the Ethics Committee of Shuguang Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (2023-1357-124-01).All study participants will be required to give written informed consent. The findings of the study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication and presented at scientific conferences. Additionally, the participants will receive copies of the results.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Gouty arthritis is a common inflammatory condition caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to intense pain, swelling, and functional impairment. Thermal therapies, including hot and cold fomentation, are often used as adjunctive treatments for managing inflammation and pain in various musculoskeletal conditions. However, the efficacy of these therapies in acute gout remains underexplored. This study aims to compare the effects of hot fomentation versus cold fomentation in patients experiencing acute gout flares, assessing pain reduction, swelling, joint mobility, and overall patient satisfaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 2,400 patients diagnosed with acute gouty arthritis, divided into two equal groups: Group A received hot fomentation (38°C-42°C) and Group B received cold fomentation (5°C-10°C). Both interventions were applied twice daily for 20 min over 5 days, alongside standard gout care. Pain intensity was measured using the visual analog scale (VAS), while joint circumference, range of motion, and patient satisfaction were recorded at baseline, day 3, and day 5. Statistical analyses compared outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS: Cold fomentation significantly reduced pain intensity (VAS score reduction of 68% by day 5) compared to hot fomentation (26% reduction, P < 0.001). Joint swelling decreased by 25% in the cold group versus 5% in the hot group, with cold therapy also leading to greater improvements in joint mobility (average increase of 15° vs. 5°, P < 0.01). Notably, 35% of patients in the hot fomentation group experienced flare-ups, compared to only 2% in the cold fomentation group (P < 0.001). Patient satisfaction was also higher in the cold group, with 85% of participants reporting satisfaction versus 30% in the hot group. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that cold fomentation is significantly more effective than hot fomentation in managing acute gouty arthritis. Cold therapy provided superior pain relief, reduced swelling, improved joint mobility, and minimized the risk of symptom exacerbation. In contrast, hot fomentation often worsened symptoms, making it unsuitable for acute gout management. These findings suggest that cold fomentation should be the preferred thermal therapy for gout flare-ups, while heat applications should be avoided."

A total of 105 children aged between 8 and 10 years whose dental treatment required inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) injection participated in this randomized controlled clinical trial. The participants were randomly divided into three groups: Group A: eye massage with natural sounds; Group B: eye massage only; and Group C (control group): traditional behavior management techniques. Anxiety and pain were assessed before, during, and after anesthesia using the Children's Fear Scale (CFS), Wong-Baker pain rating scale (WBS), the Face-Legs-Activity-Cry-Consolability (FLACC) observational pain assessment scale, and pulse rate as a physiological scale. Anxiety and pain significantly decreased in groups A and B compared with those in the control group (p < 0.05), with group A showing a greater decrease in pulse rate and objective pain assessed during injection via the FLACC scale than group B (p < 0.05); however, no significant difference was noted between groups A and B regarding the data recorded after anesthesia using the WBS and CFS (p > 0.05). Changes in pulse rate and anxiety levels (CFS) measured before and after the procedure in each group revealed a significant decrease in fear and pulse rate in group A and no significant change in group B, whereas group C showed a significant increase in pulse rate and fear at the end of the procedure. Eye massage with natural sounds can effectively alleviate children's anxiety in the dental setting and reduce pain related to anesthesia, and the combination of these two interventions has the best relaxation effect on children.",

METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP Database, and Wanfang Data were searched. Meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Primary outcomes were body weight (BW) and body mass index (BMI). Secondary outcomes were waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting insulin (FINS), and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and adverse events. RESULTS: Thirteen randomized controlled trials were included. The meta-analysis showed that massage combined with lifestyle intervention significantly decreased BW (mean difference [MD]: -4.85; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -8.25 to -1.46; P = .005), BMI (MD: -2.65; 95% CI: -4.05 to -1.24; P = .0002), WC (MD: -3.63; 95% CI: -6.28 to -0.98; P = .007), TC (MD: -0.52; 95% CI: -0.84 to -0.20; P = .001), TG (MD: -0.23; 95% CI: -0.45 to -0.02; P = .003), LDL-C (MD: -0.48; 95% CI: -0.54 to -0.42; P < .00001), HDL-C (MD: -0.11; 95% CI: -0.17 to -0.05; P = .0004), FINS (MD: -1.64; 95% CI: -3.16 to -0.12; P = .03), and HOMA-IR (MD: -0.42; 95% CI: -0.65 to -0.18; P = .0005) compared with lifestyle intervention alone. In subgroup analyses, more obvious reduction in BMI (P = .02, I2 = 80.3%) for the children and adolescents subgroup, more obvious reduction in HC (P = .04, I2 = 76.1%) for the adults subgroup, more significant reduction in TC (P < .00001, I2 = 98.3%), LDL-C (P < .00001, I2 = 95.6%), and HDL-C (P < .0001, I2 = 94.1%) for intermittent treatment subgroup and more significant reduction in TC (P < .00001, I2 = 95.9%) and HDL-C (P < .0001, I2 = 94.1%) for treatment times ≤30 subgroup were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with lifestyle intervention alone, massage combined with lifestyle intervention significantly decreased BW, BMI, WC, TC, TG, LDL-C, FINS, and HOMA-IR, but produced less effect in increasing HDL-C. And different ages, treatment intervals, and treatment times can all affect treatment outcomes.",

The study initially enrolled 309 female students with primary dysmenorrhea studying at a university in the Central Anatolia Region of Türkiye. After exclusions (due to secondary dysmenorrhea diagnosis, study discontinuation, or drug use), the study was completed with a total of 267 students. The students were divided into three groups as follows: (1) the acupressure+massage group, (2) the massage-only group, and (3) the control group. Acupressure + massage and massage-only groups were timed for the first 3 days of three consecutive menstrual cycles. The primary outcome of the study was the mean pain score for primary dysmenorrhea. Data were collected with the Visual Analog Scale, Daily Menstrual Symptom Rating Scale, and Short Form 12 Health Survey. Results: In the first cycle and first day of preintervention measurement, the physical and mental health levels, which are the subscales of pain severity, menstrual symptom intensity, and quality of life, were similar in the three groups (p > 0.05). In other measurements during the three cycles, it was determined that the pain severity and menstrual symptom intensity in the acupressure + massage and massage-only group were lower than the control group (p < 0.05). After the intervention, it was determined that there was no significant difference in all subscales of the Quality of Life Scale (p > 0.05). In the acupressure + massage group, three participants reported having adverse reactions, including pain at the acupoints (n = 1) and shift in menstruation cycle (n = 2); in the massage-only group, four participants reported having adverse reactions, including redness (n = 3) and tingling in a finger (n = 1). Conclusion: It was determined that acupressure and massage applied to those with primary dysmenorrhea were effective methods to reduce the pain level and menstrual symptom intensity, but did not affect their quality of life. Clinical Trials Number: A Clinical trials number was received from ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04942288).",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Performing sacral massage during the childbirth process can provide numerous benefits due to its potential to alleviate stress and exhaustion. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the effectiveness of sacral massage in pregnant women during labor. METHOD: A comprehensive search was conducted in main databases from inception to 18th May 2024. The quality of included randomized control trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies was assessed using the Jadad Scale and the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies (RoBANS), respectively. All analyses were performed using the RevMan version 5.3. The GRADEpro GDT tool was utilized to determine the level of certainty of the evidence. FINDINGS: Nine articles were included in the systematic review and eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. The findings showed that in the sacral massage group, the labor pain intensity was significantly decreased (SMD= -2.40, 95 % CI -3. 5 to -1.29, p<0.0001, I² = 97 %). The findings also showed that sacral massage does not significantly alter the length of the first labor stage (MD=-0.04, 95 % CI -0.27 to 0.20, p = 0.77, I² = 0 %) and the total duration of labor (MD= -0.56, 95 % CI -1.66, 0.55,p = 0.32, I² = 90 %). The certainty of evidence for labor pain was moderate and for duration of the first stage and total duration of labor were very low. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that sacral massage was an effective, non-pharmacologic method that significantly alleviating pain in women during childbirth. As a result, this intervention can be implemented in clinical settings during labor.",

This study explores the novel application of massage therapy (MT) in children with acute burns, assessing utilization and impact on pain and relaxation. METHODS: A retrospective review of 198 children with thermal injury admitted to an American Burn Association-verified pediatric burn center between January 2022 and July 2023 was conducted, excluding those requiring intensive care admission. Demographics, injury details, and MT variables were summarized using descriptive statistics. A logistic regression explored the impact of age, length of stay (LOS), and total body surface area on MT provision. RESULTS: All patients received MT consultation, with 13.6% of patients (n = 27) undergoing 43 MT sessions, with a median duration of 25.0 min. Common burn mechanisms in the MT group were scalds (55.6%), flame (22.2%), and contact (14.8%) burns. Of patients reporting pain pre-massage, 75.0% experienced pain relief, and 95.3% were content, relaxed or resting comfortably post-intervention. Barriers to MT included patients being asleep (42.1%), off the unit (33.7%), or attended to by other health-care providers (21.1%). Patients receiving MT had a longer median LOS compared to those who did not (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: MT is potentially valuable for children admitted with acute burns, reducing pain and promoting relaxation. However, patients admitted on weekends and with short admissions frequently missed MT treatment. Addressing barriers through additional weekend resources, provider education, and increased awareness of patient readiness for sessions may improve access to MT."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ice massage is commonly employed in the management of non-communicable diseases like hypertension and diabetes. However, there is a paucity of evidence regarding abdominal ice massage on blood glucose level (BGL) and cardiovascular function either in healthy or pathological conditions. Thus, this study was conducted to assess the effects of ice massage to the abdomen on BGL and cardiovascular functions in healthy individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our single-group pre-test and post-test experimental study, 50 healthy (27 females and 23 males) volunteers aged 24.72 ± 5.48 years were recruited. All the subjects underwent only one session of ice massage to the abdomen for 20 min. Random BGL and cardiovascular functions such as systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse rate (PR), pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP), rate pressure product (RPP), and double product (Do-P) were assessed before, immediately after, and 20 min after the intervention. RESULTS: The study showed a significant reduction in PR, RPP, and Do-P in the post-test assessments, whereas in the follow-up assessment (i.e., 20 min after the intervention), a significant reduction was found in random blood glucose, SBP, DBP, PR, MAP, RPP, and Do-P compared to the pre-test assessments. No adverse effects were reported by any of the participants during and after the intervention. CONCLUSION: Twenty minutes of ice massage to the abdomen improves cardiovascular function immediately after the intervention, whereas after 20 min of intervention, it reduces BGL in addition to improving cardiovascular function in healthy individuals. However, long-term randomized controlled trials in patients with diabetes are recommended with a larger sample size to warrant the clinical efficacy of this study."

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Current protocols for delivering percussive therapy (PT) using massage guns are heterogeneous creating a need to establish the impact of study design on physiological measures. This cross-over design study aimed to determine the most effective protocol, among the eight protocols examined, on lower body flexibility, and to support the provision of protocol validation for future research. METHOD: Recreationally active healthy adults (n = 35) undertook two main protocols; three sessions per week at 2100 rpm or increasing the speed from session-to-session: 1750 to 2100-2400 rpm. PT was applied for 60 s to each of the quadriceps, gluteals, hamstrings and calves of both legs. Paired-samples t-tests assessed pre- and post-intervention data for hip flexion and ankle dorsi-flexion range of motion (ROM). These were collected in all sessions using a digital goniometer allowing changes for eight different protocols to be examined. RESULTS: Results showed the most effective protocol, among the eight protocols examined, for achieving significant gains in lower body flexibility is applying massage gun PT three times a week with increased speeds across sessions (1750-2100-2400 rpm), with average increases for the combined dominant and non-dominant legs of 5.8% for hip flexion and 5.6% ankle dorsiflexion. CONCLUSIONS: Practitioners and the public using this protocol could target specific improvements in hip flexion and ankle dorsi-flexion ROM and researchers may wish to adopt this protocol to allow homogenous analysis across study populations in future research.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) are an array of conditions affecting the human locomotor system, such as muscles, tendons, nerves, bones, and joints. It is related to physiological, kinesiological and biomechanical changes which result in pain, paresthesia, inflammation, weakness, tiredness, heaviness in limbs, fatigue, reduced range of motion and/or compression of peripheral nerves. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of positive (massage gum) or negative pressure (vacuum therapy) combined with laser on the health of workers with back pain, investigating pain intensity, shoulder mobility, spinal flexibility, life quality, and well-being. METHODS: Twenty-one workers (female and male) aged between 20 and 60 years and who had medical referral for pain complaint in low back, neck and shoulders due to WMSDs participated in this study and were randomized into 3 groups: (1) Positive Pressure plus Laser Group (PPL): positive pressure using a massage gun was applied after the laser; (2) Negative Pressure plus Laser Group (NPL): negative pressure by vacuum was applied together with the laser and; (3) Control group (CG): without positive and negative pressure treatments or laser therapy. All workers received an educational booklet with postural orientation and suggestions focused on stretching exercises. Anamnesis, visual analogue scale (VAS) to assess pain intensity, and functional tests to assess spine flexibility and shoulders mobility were performed. Quality of life and well-being also were evaluated. The regions of lumbar, thoracic and cervical spine were treated once a week, totaling seven sessions. RESULTS: The main result was a reduced pain and an increased spinal flexibility, shoulders mobility, and quality of life in the PPL and NPL groups compared to the CG (p < 0.05). Furthermore, NPL showed better results compared to PPL (p < 0.05) for lumbar and cervical pain, as well as for right shoulder mobility. CONCLUSION: Therefore, laser combined with negative pressure massage was more effective in reducing lumbar and cervical pain and increasing shoulder mobility compared to positive pressure massage in workers.",

In rats who perform a repetitive work task, who left untreated develop signs and symptoms that resemble repetitive motion disorders in humans, we have shown that manual therapy prevents the development of fibrosis and other key biomarkers. The fibrosis of RIF and repetitive motion disorders has similar biomarkers. In rats, we sought to determine if manual therapy would alter key biomarkers of post-irradiation fibrosis following X-ray irradiation given to the rat forelimb. One limb of rats was given a damaging dose of X-ray irradiation. Some limbs were massaged using a protocol previously described and characterized. Serum inflammatory markers, histological assays of tissue fibrosis and nerve pathology, and electrophysiology for neuropathic discharge were assayed after 8 weeks. We also tested if an experienced therapist could identify the irradiated limb using blinded palpation at the 8 week end-point. While preliminary assays showed robust changes compared to control limbs, the other assays did not show similar pathology. Our therapist could detect each irradiated limb. Serum inflammatory markers were reduced by massage to the irradiated limb. We conclude that blinded palpation is sensitive to detect subtle changes in tissue following irradiation. In contrast to the preliminary studies, the dose of irradiation used was insufficient to induce long-lasting deep fibrosis or nerve degeneration. We suspect that a difference in housing, and thus physical activity, was the plausible reason for this difference.",

      "abstract": "Benefits of attachment security have been demonstrated in multiple realms of development, and an extensive body of research has identified some of the antecedents associated with the development of secure attachments. While previous research has indicated that infant massage may support the development of mothers' attachment to their babies, no published research exists that investigated infants' attachment security after mothers learn infant massage strokes. This study tested the impact of an infant massage intervention on mothers' massage frequency and attachment security in infants. Fifty-eight mother-infant dyads were randomly assigned to a treatment (massage, n = 28) or control (education, n = 30) group. Most mothers had preschool aged children participating in Head Start as well as an infant under 8 months of age; the remaining mothers were from the community. Mothers in the treatment group completed 4 weeks of infant massage training using standard strokes from Infant Massage USA, a chapter of the International Association of Infant Massage, headquartered in Sweden. At 12 months, mothers were guided through the standard sorting procedure of the Attachment Q-set (Waters, 1987). The treatment was effective, as 86 % of mothers in the massage group were still massaging their babies at the follow-up, an average of 10 months later, and infants whose mothers massaged them had higher attachment security scores. Surprisingly, 29 % of the mothers in the comparison group reported that they massaged their babies. A treatment X massage frequency ANOVA indicated that 12-month-old infants whose mothers in the treatment group had massaged them more than once per week were more securely attached than infants of mothers who massaged their infants less than once per week and also were more securely attached than infants in the comparison group. However mothers in the control group defined massage, it was not associated with infant attachment security at the follow-up. These results indicate that this inexpensive, easy to implement intervention effectively increased mothers' ongoing use of infant massage, which in turn predicted more attachment security in their infants.",

BACKGROUND: The effect of massage therapy on the muscle properties is unclear. New technologies make investigation more in-depth and reliable. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effects of a 5-min massage session on the muscle stiffness and tone reduction in healthy young adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants aged between 19 and 24 were randomly assigned to an intervention group (IG) (n = 40) or a control group (CG) (n = 40). The IG participated in a 5-min massage session of the lateral and medial gastrocnemius muscle (LGCM and MGCM respectively). The muscle contractile properties were assessed by tensiomyography (TMG). It measured maximal displacement (Dm), delay time (Td) and contraction time (Tc). Oscillation frequency (F) and stiffness (S) were used to assess muscle passive mechanical properties. These measurements were collected by MytonPro. RESULTS: There were no differences between the groups in the pre-test measurements. The results of mixed-model ANOVA showed significant (p < 0.05) time × group interactions, with greater alteration in the IG compared to the CG in the LGCM for Dm (%diff = 22.5, ƞp2 = 0.41), Td (%diff = 3.63, ƞp2 = 0.02), Tc (%diff = 13.38, ƞp2 = 0.1), F (%diff = 5.55, ƞp2 = 0.07) and in the MGCM for Dm (%diff = -14.34, ƞp2 = 0.06), F (%diff = -7.53, ƞp2 = 0.12). No difference (p > 0.05) was noticed in other variables. CONCLUSIONS: A 5-min massage session impacts the contractile and passive mechanical properties of the LGCM and MGCM. The size and direction of changes may depend on the muscle type, its geometry as well as other factors.",

In this study, it was aimed to examine the immediate effects of IASTM and PMT on static and dynamic balance in young adults with pes planus. METHOD: The navicular drop test was used to diagnose pes planus. 51 individuals were included in the study and divided into three groups [IASTM (n:15), percussive massage (n:18) and control (n:18) groups] by simple randomization. Flamingo and Y Balance test was assessed before and immediately after intervention. Repeated Measures ANOVA test was used for the intergroup comparison, and the One-Way ANOVA test was used for the intragroup comparison, also post-hoc test with Tukey correction was performed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in static balance between the three groups (p > 0.05). There was a significant difference in dynamic balance between groups (p < 0.05). Only IASTM group had significant differences at before and after intervention of all directions except for posterolateral direction of Y Balance Test (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: IASTM applied to the plantar fascia of individuals with pes planus have immediate effects on dynamic balance when compared to no intervention and percussive massage even within a small sample size.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The pain, external knee adduction moment (EKAM), and muscle co-contraction are increased in knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Massage therapy decreases pain in KOA, yet KOA is a mechanical disease and biomechanical changes need to be investigated as well. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the effectiveness of massage on these outcomes in individuals with medial KOA. METHODS: A cohort of fifteen participants with confirmed medial compartment KOA (2 males, 13 females, age: 61.33 (6.16) years; height: 1.62 (0.06) m; mass: 65.39 (4.04) kg; BMI: 24.74 (4.04) kg/m2) was given a six-week massage. Outcomes assessed pre- and post-intervention were: Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores, temporal-spatial variables, knee joint kinematics and kinetics in sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes, vertical ground reaction force (GRF), and knee antagonist muscle co-contraction during gait. The paired t-test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Fifteen participants completed the study. Significant improvements were observed in WOMAC scores (pain, stiffness, function, and total), walking speed, step length, 1st peak GRF, sagittal plane knee joint range of motion during stance, and medial muscle co-contraction in early and mid-stance (p < 0.05). However, no significant change was found in EKAM and knee adduction angular impulse (KAAI) (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Massage therapy, as a stand-alone treatment, reduces pain, improves function, and decreases medial muscle co-contraction in individuals with medial KOA. Although EKAM did not change, the results suggest a reduction in medial muscle co-contraction might be a mechanism by which pain is improved.",

Current treatments primarily focus on controlling symptoms and improving the quality of life. The aim of our study was to determine how connective tissue massage (CTM) and kinesiotaping (KT) affect pain and depression in patients with fibromyalgia, and to compare their effects on quality of life. METHODS: Thirty-four patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia were included. Participants divided into two groups. Group 1: CTM (n = 17, mean age = 35.47 ± 6.84 years), Group 2: KT (n = 17, mean age = 34.00 ± 5.46 years). This study was initiated by obtaining sociodemographic information. Pain (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)), pain characteristics (McGill Pain Questionnaire), disease impact on patients (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ)), depression (Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI)), and quality of life (Short Form-36 (SF-36)) were evaluated. All participants received electrotherapy (TENS and infrared treatment) for 25 min, 5 days a week for 4 weeks. CTM was applied 3 days a week, KT was applied 2 days a week for 4 weeks. RESULTS: A significant improvement with very large effect size was found in VAS, McGill, FIQ, BDI, and SF-36 variables in both groups (p < 0.05). The change after 4 weeks of treatment was similar between groups in terms of all parameters (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Both CTM and KT improved pain, disease effects depression, and quality of life. These two interventions, which are not superior, can be added to the treatment program for patients with fibromyalgia.",

OBJECTIVE: This two-armed double-blind, randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the immediate effects of Thai foot massage (TFM) on RBF, psychological stress, and heart rate variability (HRV) in older adult persons. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 26 healthy older adult volunteers were recruited and randomly assigned to the TFM group (13 persons) and the control group (13 persons). The TFM group received a 15-minute Thai foot massage, and the control group received a 15-minute bed rest. Primary outcomes - RBF parameters [peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), resistive index (RI), volumetric arterial blood flow (VF)] and secondary outcomes - HRV parameters [standard deviation of the normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), high frequency (HF), low frequency (LF), and low frequency per high frequency (LF/HF)] were measured after each intervention. RESULTS: Results showed that the VF significantly increased after TFM (P < 0.05) but not in control. Meanwhile, the stress index significantly reduced after TFM (P < 0.05). SDNN and RMSSD, the proxies of parasympathetic activity, also significantly increased in the TFM group (p < 0.05). Only RMSSD was significantly enhanced in the control group. No side effects were observed. CONCLUSION: The TFM could increase RBF and alleviate psychological stress through parasympathetic activity actuation. Therefore, this intervention might improve RBF and relieve stress in the older population. Further study should be carried out on a larger population.",

METHODS: This review was reported according to the PRISMA guidelines. Studies evaluating the effects of massage therapy on cancer pain, quality of life or anxiety in patients with cancer pain were eligible. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation were used to assess the quality of studies. Outcomes were pooled using standardised mean differences and narratively synthesised when meta-analysis was not possible. DATA SOURCES: Pubmed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Google Scholar, ProQuest Theses and Dissertations were searched for English peer-reviewed studies and grey literature published from inception to 8 January 2024. RESULTS: Thirty-six RCTs involving 3671 participants were included. Massage therapy significantly improved pain (pooled SMD = -0.51, 95% CI -0.68 to -0.33), quality of life (pooled SMD = 0.48, 95% CI 0.19-0.78 when higher scores indicate better quality of life; pooled SMD = -0.52, 95% CI -0.88 to -0.16 when higher scores indicate poorer quality of life) and anxiety (pooled SMD = -0.38, 95% CI: -0.57 to -0.18) post-intervention. All outcomes had very low certainty of evidence. Most studies had unclear or high risk of bias. CONCLUSION: This review found that massage therapy is beneficial to patients with cancer in improving pain, quality of life and anxiety.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Various interventions have been applied to reduce perineal trauma and obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS). The efficacy of warm compresses during the second stage of labor for reducing the occurrence of perineal tears is controversial. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare rates of spontaneous perineal tears requiring suturing, between women who received warm compresses plus perineal massage vs perineal massage alone. STUDY DESIGN: Women admitted to a single tertiary university-affiliated hospital between June 2023 and January 2024 were randomized to receive warm compresses and perineal massage (n=206) or perineal message only (n=206) during the second stage of labor. Excluded were women with a history of third-degree perineal tear, nut allergy, fetal death, Crohn's disease with perineal involvement, or delivery number >5. Participant allocation was concealed until the second stage of labor. The allocated perineal management was implemented at the time of active fetal descent and when the participant felt the need to push. During active maternal pushing, gentle perineal massage with almond oil was performed in both study groups. In 1 group, warm compresses were applied between contractions, for a minimum of 10 minutes and a maximum of 30. The temperature of the warm compresses was kept in the range of 45°C to 59°C. The perineum was protected during delivery with a hands-on technique. After delivery, the perineum was assessed by an intervention-blinded senior midwife and rectal examination was performed for ruling out OASIS. The primary outcome was the rate of perineal tears requiring suturing. Secondary outcomes included the rates of OASIS and episiotomies. A sub-analysis according to parity and an intention-to-treat analysis were performed. RESULTS: Similar proportions of women treated and not treated with warm compresses had spontaneous perineal tears requiring suturing: 43.7% vs 45.1%, P value=.766. The groups did not differ in the proportions with first-degree tears, 22.8% vs 21.4%, P value=.722; second-degree tears, 21.4% vs 23.8%, P value=.566; and OASIS rates, 0.5% in each. In a sub-analysis according to parity, the proportion with perineal tears did not differ between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: For women treated during the second stage of labor with warm compresses and perineal massage, compared to perineal massage alone, the rate of spontaneous perineal tears requiring suturing was similar.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic constipation is a common distressing symptom. Abdominal massage is a safe, noninvasive, and comfortable intervention. However, it is rarely used in formal clinical practice as its' effectiveness for chronic constipation remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to investigate the effectiveness of abdominal massage on defecation frequency, stool consistency, colonic transit time, constipation symptoms, quality of life, laxative use, and adverse events in adults. Additionally, we aimed to compare the effectiveness of abdominal massage in chronic constipation with different etiologies and types of abdominal massage techniques. METHODS: Data from eight English and Chinese electronic databases until May 15, 2024, including randomized controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-experimental studies, were used. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Results were synthesized using a random-effect model. This study was registered on the 7th of January 2023 to the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, CRD42023385243). RESULTS: A total of 23 studies with 1431 participants were eligible for the meta-analysis. Abdominal massage statistically significantly increased weekly defecation frequency (MD = 1.59; 95 % CI 1.06, 2.11; df = 10; I2 = 82 %), decreased gut transit time (MD = -21.53 h; 95 % CI -35.94, -7.12; df = 3; I2 = 65 %), and decreased constipation symptoms (SMD = -1.06; 95 % CI -1.33, -0.80; df = 18; I2 = 79 %) as compared to the control group; however, it did not reduce laxative use (OR: 0.43, 95 % CI 0.14, 1.34, p = 0.15; I2 = 74 %). In subgroup analysis, the effectiveness of defecation frequency appeared to be greater for functional constipation (SMD = 1.23; 95 % CI 0.87, 1.60; df = 6; I2 = 86 %) as compared to opioid-induced constipation (SMD = 1.06; 95 % CI 0.61, 1.50; df = 5; I2 = 5 %) or neurogenic bowel dysfunction (SMD = 0.68; 95 % CI 0.26, 1.10; df = 4; I2 = 51 %). There were statistically significant differences in defecation frequency between the functional constipation and neurogenic bowel dysfunction groups (p = 0.075). Acupressure and aromatherapy massage had a greater effect on defecation frequency (SMD = 1.63; 95 % CI 1.06, 2.21; df = 3; I2 = 86 %) than circular massage (SMD = 0.90; 95 % CI 0.57, 1.22; df = 10; I2 = 68 %) or electric device massages (SMD = 0.83; 95 % CI 0.15, 1.51; df = 1; I2 = 82 %); however, high heterogeneity and a limited number of articles were encountered. No adverse reactions were observed in the non-neurogenic bowel dysfunction group. CONCLUSION: This study reveals the efficacy of abdominal massage in alleviating symptoms of chronic constipation, as well as the differences in the effectiveness of different constipation types and massage techniques. Patients, caregivers, and health professionals can select abdominal massage techniques based on their effectiveness in specific type of constipation or troublesome symptoms. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Abdominal massage is effective for chronic constipation, increasing defecation frequency and improving symptoms. Users can tailor massage technique to specific constipation type for optimal results. #ConstipationRelief #GutHealth.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Functional massage (FM) is a soft tissue technique that incorporates non-end range joint movement with tissue compression to treat musculotendinous pain and dysfunction. FM has been associated with promoting neural excitability and neuromuscular efficiency. In clinical practice, FM may be used at the beginning of a treatment session to prepare fibers of the target muscle and surrounding soft tissues for functional activity. The Physical Working Capacity at the Fatigue Threshold (PWC<inf>FT</inf>) uses surface electromyography (EMG) to demarcate between non-fatiguing and fatiguing exercise. To our knowledge, no studies have examined the efficacy of FM when performed prior to an exercise session. The purpose of this study was to determine whether pre-performance FM delays the onset of neuromuscular fatigue. We hypothesized that FM would increase maximal power output as well as PWC<inf>FT</inf> compared to the control condition. METHODS: Thirteen healthy college-aged men (mean±SEM: age, 24.1±0.5 years; weight, 83.0±3.2 kg; and height, 1.80±0.02 m) ranging from 22 to 28 years-old volunteered for the present study. On two occasions separated by at least 7 days, participants visited the laboratory to perform single-leg knee-extensor ergometer exercise after either receiving 7 min of FM (experimental condition) or no FM (control condition). RESULTS: The results indicated that the onset of neuromuscular fatigue was significantly delayed for the absolute and relative PWC<inf>FT</inf> (~80%) values compared to the control condition. There was no significant mean difference between FM and control for maximal power output. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study indicated that FM was effective in delaying neuromuscular fatigue as assessed by PWC<inf>FT</inf>. These findings may be applicable to both athletic and clinical settings as FM prior to exercise may help to prime a target muscle before training."

This study evaluated the effects of connective tissue massage on postmenopausal symptoms, menopause-specific quality of life, and insomnia. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 57 postmenopausal women were randomly allocated to either the massage group (n = 28) or the control group (sham therapeutic ultrasound) (n = 29). Participants received massage or the sham intervention in 3 sessions per week for 4 weeks, each session lasting 15 min. The Wilcoxon test was used for within-group comparisons, and the independent groups t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Pearson chi-square test were used for between-group comparisons. Statistical significance was set as p ≤ .05. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was menopausal symptom severity, assessed by the Menopause Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes included hot flash frequency, hot flash score (frequency × severity), menopause-specific quality of life, emotional status, insomnia, and satisfaction with the intervention. RESULTS: Data from 52 of the 57 participants were included in the final analysis. There was a greater improvement in the massage group compared with the control group in all primary and secondary outcome measures except insomnia severity (p ≤ .05). CONCLUSIONS: Connective tissue massage can be offered as a first-line approach to improve physical and emotional health in the short term for postmenopausal women. Further studies are needed to determine the long-term effects. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05293860.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of complementary therapies to relieve the side effects of chemotherapy in lung cancer patients is becoming increasingly popular. Practices from traditional Chinese medicine, such as acupoint massage and five-tone therapy, have demonstrated potential in alleviating symptoms such as nausea and vomiting experienced during chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the effectiveness of combining five-tone therapy with acupoint massage in reducing chemotherapy-related symptoms in lung cancer patients. The main objective is to determine how these complementary therapies affect the quality of life and well-being of people undergoing chemotherapy for lung cancer. METHODS: In this paper, 80 patients diagnosed with lung cancer who needed chemotherapy drugs were randomly divided into 2 groups, 40 patients. The first was treatment; the second was control. Chemotherapy drugs were combined with a 5-hydroxytryptamine blocker (granisetron), and acupoint massage was combined with pentatone therapy to prevent nausea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal reactions. A 5-hydroxytryptamine blocker (granisetron) was combined with chemotherapy drugs to prevent nausea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal reactions. Moreover, the difference in treatment effect was observed. RESULTS: Among 40 cases in treatment, 13 cases were clinically controlled, 15 cases were markedly effective, 9 cases were effective, and 3 cases were ineffective. The total effective rate was 92.50%; among 40 cases in control, 6 cases were clinically controlled, 16 cases were markedly effective, 12 cases were practical, and 6 cases were invalid. The total effective rate was 85.00%. CONCLUSION: By integrating traditional Chinese medicine techniques, healthcare professionals can augment the supportive care offered to those undergoing chemotherapy for lung cancer.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP) is prevalent among firefighters and may negatively affect their job performance. Alterations in the thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) structure are associated with CNSLBP. Percussive massage therapy (PT) has demonstrated potential in modifying fascial properties and alleviating pain. However, its effects on TLF structure in CNSLBP patients have not been thoroughly investigated. This study evaluates the effects of 6 weeks of PT on TLF echo intensity, thickness, pain, and disability in firefighters with CNSLBP, utilizing ultrasound imaging as a primary assessment tool. METHODS: This six-week randomized controlled trial involved 38 firefighters with CNSLBP. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to either the PT group (receiving PT and core stability exercise) or the control group (receiving only core stability exercise). TLF echo intensity and thickness were measured using ultrasound imaging, and disability was assessed using the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMQ) at baseline and post-intervention. Pain was measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at baseline, immediately after the first intervention, three weeks post-intervention, and post-intervention. Paired t-tests were conducted to analyze within-group changes in RMQ and ultrasound data, while ANCOVA was used to assess between-group differences, and repeated measures ANOVA for VAS scores. RESULTS: Participants in the PT and control groups were aged 26.6±4.1 and 23.6±1.7 years, respectively, with BMI of 23.1±1.8 and 21.8±1.2 kg/m². The PT group showed significant reductions in bilateral TLF echo intensity post-intervention (left side: mean difference -6.4, 95% CI -9.7 to -3.1, p < 0.001, effect size 0.67; right side: mean difference  -7.6, 95% CI -11.8 to -3.3, p < 0.01, effect size 0.60). Changes in TLF thickness were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The PT group demonstrated significantly lower VAS scores than the control group (mean difference - 0.626, 95% CI -1.087 to -0.165, p = 0.009, effect size 0.63). RMQ scores decreased by -1.3 (95% CI -2.1 to -0.4, p < 0.01, effect size 0.5). CONCLUSION: Six weeks of percussive massage therapy significantly reduced thoracolumbar fascia echo intensity, alleviated pain, and improved functional disability in firefighters with chronic non-specific low back pain, but was not effective in altering fascia thickness. Percussive massage therapy emerges as an effective and safe strategy for managing chronic non-specific low back pain in firefighters.

According to the different treatment methods, they were divided into observation group and control group with 41 cases in each group. The control group was treated with routine treatment, and the observation group was treated with meridian massage on the basis of routine treatment. In the control group, there were 30 males and 11 females;aged from 22 to 52 years old with an average of (42.27±9.34) years old;the Body mass index (BMI) ranged from 19 to 28 kg·m-2 with an average of(23.82±1.08) kg·m-2;the course of disease ranged from 0.5 to 3.0 years (2.40±0.48) years. There were 28 cases in L4,5 segment and 13 cases in L5S1 segment. In the observation group, there were 28 males and 13 females;the age ranged from 19 to 54 years old (42.19±9.26) years old;the BMI ranged from 18 to 29 kg·m-2 with an average of(23.73±1.15) kg·m-2;the course of disease ranged from 0.6 to 2.8 with an average of(2.56±0.45) years;there were 26 cases in L4,5 segment and 15 cases in L5S1 segment. Visual analogue scale(VAS), Oswestry disability index(ODI), M-JOA score and TCM syndrome score were measured before and after 3 courses of treatment, and the clinical efficacy was evaluated by the standard of curative effect evaluation. RESULTS: After treatment, VAS [(3.24±1.45) vs(4.46±0.64)], ODI [(11.45±1.98)% vs (17.21±2.74)%] and TCM symptom score [(2.03±0.27) vs (3.99± 0.54)] of the observation group were lower than those of the control group. The score of M-JOA [(23.43±2.61) vs (19.37±1.62)] increased (P<0.05). The scores of VAS, ODI and TCM symptoms in the observation group were lower than those in the control group, while the scores of M-JOA were higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Meridian massage is effective in the treatment of LDH, which can effectivelyrelieve low back pain, improve clinical symptoms and increaselumbar function, which is worthy of clinical promotion.",

Materials and Methods: This randomized controlled trial included 44 women with endometriosis. They were randomly allocated to either the 'HAMMAM' group (n = 21) or to a control group (n = 23). The primary outcome, pain intensity, was evaluated using numeric rating scales (NRSs). The secondary outcomes were pain interference, pain-related catastrophic thoughts, pressure pain thresholds (PPTs), subjective well-being, functional capacity and QoL, which were evaluated using the brief pain inventory (BPI), the pain catastrophizing scale (PCS), algometry, the subjective well-being scale-20 (EBS-20), the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-29 (PROMIS-29) and the Endometriosis Health Profile-30 Questionnaire (EHP-30), respectively. The primary and secondary outcomes were measured at the baseline and after the intervention. The statistical (between-group analyses of covariance) and clinical effects were analyzed by the intention to treat. Results: The adherence rate was 100.0% and the mean (± standard deviation) satisfaction was 9.71 ± 0.46 out of 10. No remarkable health problems were reported during the trial. The 'HAMMAM' intervention improved dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia after the intervention with large and moderate effect sizes, respectively. Improvements in pain interference during sleep and PPTs in the pelvic region were also observed in women allocated to the 'HAMMAM' group. No effects were observed in catastrophizing thoughts, well-being nor QoL, except for the sleep subscale. Conclusions: A 4-week program of an integral 'HAMMAM' experience combining hydrotherapy and massage in a multisensorial immersive environment is a feasible and effective intervention to alleviate pain during menstruation and sexual intercourse as well as pain interference with sleep in women with endometriosis.",

      "abstract": "Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias, characterized by a sudden increase in heart rate. Initial management often involves vagal maneuvers, including the Valsalva maneuver (VM) and carotid sinus massage (CSM). VM can be categorized into standard VM (sVM) and modified VM (mVM). This study aimed to synthesize the first evidence from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of VM versus CSM. A comprehensive search across databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar, was conducted up to July 29, 2024. The primary endpoint was the success rate of converting SVT to sinus rhythm. The dichotomous outcome was analyzed using a fixed-effect model to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The Risk of Bias (RoB) tool, version 2, was employed to assess bias in the included RCTs. In total, three RCTs with 346 cases were analyzed. Concerns were noted regarding potential bias related to the randomization process in all three studies. The meta-analysis of these RCTs (comprising four arms) revealed that VM had a higher success rate than CSM for treating SVT, with an RR of 1.82 (95% CI: 1.29-2.57, p<0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that the rate of conversion to sinus rhythm was significantly higher in the sVM compared to CSM (RR=1.61, 95% CI (1.13-2.29), p=0.01). Additionally, subgroup analysis of one study indicated that mVM was associated with a higher rate of SVT conversion to sinus rhythm compared to CSM (RR=9.28, 95% CI (1.25-69.13), p=0.03). In conclusion, VM demonstrated a higher success rate compared to CSM in treating SVT. Specifically, mVM was more effective than CSM in both terminating SVT and restoring sinus rhythm, though this evidence was based on a single RCT; hence, the related conclusion should be interpreted with caution and requires validation using additional RCTs. Further research in diverse patient populations and clinical settings is necessary to validate these findings and potentially support the broader use of mVM in practice. Additional well-designed, multi-center studies with diverse populations are needed to confirm these observations and provide more comprehensive guidance on SVT management. This is important to enhance the generalizability of results across different demographics and clinical settings. This approach helps ensure that treatment effectiveness is applicable to a broader range of patients, accounting for variations in age, gender, comorbidities, and regional practices."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the short-term effects of connective tissue massage (CTM) and classic massage (CM) on pain, functional and emotional status, and menstrual complaints in women with primary dysmenorrhea (PD). METHODS: Women with PD were randomly assigned to 2 groups: CTM (n = 19) and CM (n = 19). CTM or CM was applied 5 days a week from the estimated date of ovulation to the onset of the next menstruation. The pain intensity with the Visual Analog Scale and functional and emotional status with the Functional and Emotional Dysmenorrhea Scale (FEDS) were assessed before and after the applications. Pain duration and the presence of menstrual complaints were recorded. RESULTS: In the postintervention period, both groups had decreased menstrual pain intensity and duration, drug use, and FEDS scores (P < .001). Pain duration and FEDS-functional scores decreased more in the CTM group than in the CM group (P < .05). Moreover, in the postintervention period, fewer women were nervous in the CM group, whereas low back pain, constipation, and sleeplessness were less frequent in the CTM group, compared with their preintervention period (P < .05). A difference was observed between groups only in terms of the changes in sleeplessness between before and after intervention (P = .016). CONCLUSION: CTM and CM improved menstrual pain and functional and emotional status, and decreased drug use. Moreover, CTM was superior in improving pain duration, functional status, and sleeplessness compared with CM in PD. CTM and CM might be useful treatment methods for PD.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of using tailored and multifaceted strategies on the acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility and adoption of a perineal massage and warm compress intervention by midwives in a maternity ward of a tertiary hospital in Portugal. METHODS: The complex intervention in health was developed based on the Medical Research Council framework and guided by the Theory of Change. Tailored and multifaceted strategies, including dissemination, integration and implementing process strategies, were applied. A mixed-methods approach was adopted, with a combination of qualitative (semi-open interviews) and quantitative (surveys, audits and electronic health records) methods. Surveys were applied to assess the acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility of the intervention. In order to evaluate adoption of the intervention, data from interviews were introduced into NVivo Version 10 to perform thematic analysis, and each audit checklist criterion was analysed using McNemar's exact test to determine differences in paired proportion. RESULTS: This study found high acceptability (mean±standard deviation 4.28±0.45), high appropriateness (4.32±0.47) and high feasibility (4.26±0.43) of the intervention by midwives. Differences were reported for most topics between interviews conducted before and after implementation of the intervention. Pre-intervention, the midwives reported that the main factor affecting the application of perineal protection techniques was the lack of continuous presence of the midwife. The birth position was the alternative birth position (hands and knees, side-lying, squatting and semi-sitting), avoiding the lithotomy position. Techniques used for perineal protection were warm compresses, hands-on techniques, hands-off techniques and spontaneous pushing; and the reasons given for performing an episiotomy were large (high-birthweight) baby, Kristeller manoeuvre, tense perineum and previous obstetric sphincter injury. Post-intervention, the midwives reported that the presence of a second person increases the safety of professionals and women and improves working relations. The technique used for perineal protection was autonomy to adapt the intervention with perineal massage and warm compresses. A comfortable birth position for woman was used, and the rate of episiotomy reduced (only performed in the case of fetal distress). Regarding audits, significant differences (p < 0.05) were found for all audit criteria (pre- and post-intervention), which means that midwives adopted the intervention into their clinical practice. CONCLUSION: Acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility and adoption of the intervention by midwives were high. Thus, tailored and multifaceted strategies were effective to achieve the implementation outcomes.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Labour pain experienced by women during childbirth can significantly affect the mother's psychological condition and birthing process. This study aimed to determine the effect of shiatsu massage on pain and anxiety during labour. METHOD: This randomized controlled trial was conducted on 80 nulliparous pregnant women who gave birth in four low-risk maternity clinics in Samarinda, Indonesia, from February to May 2022. The women were randomized into intervention (N=40) and control (N=40) groups based on random allocation. Certified midwives performed shiatsu massages following standard protocols. Pain was assessed using the Numeric Rating Scale, and anxiety was assessed using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Score at three times including before the intervention (T0), the latent phase (T1), and at transition phase (T2). The impact of the intervention was analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance by SPSS 26. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The intervention group showed a significant reduction in labour pain scores from 6.85±1.00 (T0) to 6.13±0.88 (T1) and 4.78±0.83 (T2) (P<0.001), while the control group showed an increase from 6.85±1.00 (T0) to 8.05±0.64 (T1) and 8.85±0.48 (T2) (P<0.001). Anxiety scores in the intervention group decreased from 28.53±4.41 (T0) to 26.15±3.59 (T1) and 20.65±2.69 (T2) (P<0.001), whereas the control group experienced an increase from 25.55±3.16 (T0) to 27.05±3.36 (T1) and 31.73±3.27 (T2) (P<0.001). The between-subject effects in time levels for labour pain and anxiety in the two study groups had a significant impact (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Findings showed that shiatsu massage was effective and safe for relieving pain and reducing anxiety during childbirth of nulliparous women. This research suggests that shiatsu massage can be used as an effective alternative method to relieve pain and anxiety during labour in low risk pregnancies, particularly in settings with limited access to pharmaceutical analgesics.Trial Registration Number: IRCT20220317054316N1.",

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 116 patients with FS treated at the Guangdong Work Injury Rehabilitation Hospital from October 2022 to October 2023. The study included 61 patients who received NWM combined with trigger point massage (research group) and 55 patients who received conventional treatment (control group). Shoulder function and pain were assessed using the Constant-Murley Score (CMS) and the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). Additionally, the time to resume normal daily activities, time to achieve no self-perceived pain, and adverse reactions were documented. Post-treatment stress response indicators and inflammatory factors; adrenaline (ADR), cortisol (Cor), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), C-reactive protein (CRP), nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), were measured. A 3-month follow-up was conducted to record prognostic recurrence. RESULTS: After treatment, the research group showed significantly better shoulder function, reduced pain, and shorter times to resume daily activities and to achieve no self-perceived pain compared to the control group (all P<0.05). Post-treatment levels of ADR, Cor, ACTH, CRP, NO, and PGE2 were also lower in the research group (all P<0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions did not significantly differ between groups (P>0.05); however, the recurrence rate was lower in the research group compared with the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: NWM combined with trigger point massage effectively improves shoulder function and reduces inflammation and stress responses in elderly patients with FS, supporting its clinical application."

Ankle joint mobilization and plantar massage have improved the range of motion and static postural control in those with CAI. This study aimed to determine the impact of two-week joint mobilization and plantar massage interventions on gait kinematics and kinetics in individuals with CAI. METHODS: A single-blind randomized trial was conducted with 60 participants with CAI, randomized into three groups: joint mobilization (n = 20), plantar massage (n = 20), and control (n = 20). The two treatment groups received six 5-min sessions manual therapy over a 2-week, while the control group received no intervention. Gait biomechanics were assessed on an instrumented treadmill before and after the intervention using 3D kinematics and kinetics analysis. Analyses compared biomechanical outcomes from each treatment group to the control group individually using a 1-dimensional statistical parametric mapping. The alpha level was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Eighteen participants per group were part of the final analysis. No significant main or interactions effects were found for ankle sagittal or frontal plane positions following either intervention (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). COP location relative to the lateral border of the foot also did not change (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that two-week joint mobilization and plantar massage interventions do not significantly alter gait biomechanics in individuals with CAI. These results support the need for gait-specific interventions to modify biomechanics in this population.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness and the experience of infant abdominal massage on reducing the parental stress level. METHODS: A clustered RCT was conducted, 160 parents were recruited from 10 mother groups. An infant abdominal massage class was given to those in the intervention group by a certified International Association of Infant Massage instructor. The Chinese Parenting Stress Index (PSI-SF) was used to measure parental stress levels at baseline and 4 weeks after the intervention. 8 parents from the intervention group were invited for an online interview to understand the experience of parents in participating the infant abdominal massage class. Thematic analysis was applied. RESULTS: The parental stress level was significantly decreased among intervention group with a mean difference of -5.46 (95% CI = 0.72 to 10.2, p = .049). ITT analysis was adopted for compliance analysis. The overall compliance for the intervention was 66% and found to have a significant effect on parental stress level (p < .01). The total PSI-SF among fathers was slightly higher than that among mothers. Furthermore, no moderating factors were found to have a significant interaction effect on PSI-SF (p < .05).For qualitative data, an overarching theme was generated that infant abdominal massage brought a positive experience despite the uncertainties affecting the compliance. Four themes and nine sub-themes were identified. Which were: (1) receiving clear and informative infant abdominal massage classes; (2) The influence of uncertain conditions on compliance; (3) Improving parental satisfaction; and (4) feeling it was a worthwhile experience. CONCLUSION: This study provides a cost-effective method for parents to tackle their parental stress, the findings aid in the planning or adjustment of current postpartum depression screening while also helping to lower the risk of postpartum mood disorders.

METHODS: This study was conducted as a single blinded randomized placebo-controlled parallel-group trial. Data were collected using the \"Demographic Characteristics Form\", \"Richards-Campbell Sleep Scale\", \"State-Trait Anxiety Inventory\" and \"Nottingham Health Profile\". Individuals in the reflexology and placebo groups received massages for three weeks; three times a week, for 15 minutes on each foot. Participants in the reflexology and placebo groups were followed-up before the massage and after the ninth massage session. RESULTS: In the statistical evaluation of the sleep quality scale mean scores, after the ninth massage session, it was determined that the average sleep score of the reflexology massage group was higher than that of the placebo group. Additionally, the state anxiety level was found to be lower in the reflexology group compared to the placebo group. As for the quality of life after the ninth massage session, it was determined that there was an improvement in the reflexology massage group compared to the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: This study has found that foot reflexology massage is effective in reducing anxiety levels, improving sleep, and enhancing the quality of life in patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment. The findings of this study may offer nurses greater awareness of the potential benefits of reflexology. In this way, more healthcare professionals can be encouraged to use reflexology in addition to other cares.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Epidemiological studies show the prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adolescents is around 5 %. There is strong evidence for psychosocial interventions and medication for treatment of ADHD core symptoms, but these alone do not always reach a satisfactory outcome. The aim of this small-scale study was to evaluate the impact of tactile massage on ADHD core symptoms in adolescents in a clinical setting. Secondary outcome measures addressed pain perception, ability to fall asleep, and stress levels before, during, and after the intervention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen adolescents aged 15-17 and previously diagnosed with ADHD received tactile massage sessions in an experimental, single-subject ABA study combined with a group-based evaluation using descriptive statistics. The adolescents and their parents answered questionnaires to follow up on the primary and secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The results showed a statistically significant reduction in hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention, as well as oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). Participants reported that it was significantly easier to fall asleep. There was also a tendency to perceive less pain, but these results were not statistically significant. The compliance in this study was excellent. CONCLUSION: In this study, tactile massage appears to have had a significantly positive impact on ADHD core symptoms and the ability to fall asleep. The absence of adverse physiological changes and the excellent compliance, coupled with positive results, supports the idea that tactile massage may be considered safe and beneficial for adolescents with ADHD. Our findings need to be further investigated in future research.",

      "abstract": "Massage is one of the oldest forms of therapy practiced since ancient times. Nowadays, it is used in sports practice, recovery from injury, or supportive therapy for various conditions. The practice of massage uses a variety of instruments that facilitate massaging while relieving the stress on the masseur. One of them is a foam roller. Although roller massage is widely used, there are still no scientific studies describing the biological mechanisms of its effects on the body. The purpose of our study was to analyze the effect of roller massage on BDNF levels in men undergoing self-massage 4x/week/7 weeks. The control group consisted of men who did not perform self-massage. Before the test and after the first, third, fifth, and seventh weeks of self-massage, the study participants' blood was drawn, the serum BDNF was determined, and the results were subjected to analysis of variance by ANOVA test. After the first week of self-massage, an increase in BDNF concentration was observed in the self-massage group compared to the control group (p = 0.023). Similarly, changes were observed in week five (p = 0.044) and week seven (p = 0.046). In the massaged group, BDNF concentrations were significantly higher after the first week of self-massage compared to baseline. In the third week of the study, BDNF decreased to a value comparable to the baseline study, then increased significantly in the fifth and seventh weeks compared to the value recorded in the third week (p = 0.049 and p = 0.029). It was significantly higher in week seven compared to week five (p = 0.03). Higher concentrations of BDNF in subjects undergoing roller self-massage may be one of the biological mechanisms justifying the therapeutic effects of massage in both sports and clinical practice. Studies analyzing the stimulation of BDNF synthesis through various massage techniques should be performed on a larger group of healthy individuals, patients after trauma of multiple origins, and sick people with indications for therapeutic massage.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Children with thalassemia often require repeated invasive treatments and frequent hospitalizations, resulting in pain, anxiety, and altered vital signs. Implementing non-invasive, non-pharmacological, and inexpensive complementary practices can benefit both the child and their family. Aim This study aimed to evaluate the impact of foot reflexology versus simple massage on vital signs, anxiety, and pain induced by blood transfusions in children with thalassemia. Materials and methods  An experimental study was conducted on 60 children with thalassemia; children aged 2-13 years were selected by systematic random sampling. The participants were separated into two groups: 30 children received foot reflexology and 30 children received a simple massage. Data were collected using a self-structured demographic profile, vital signs record sheet, standard Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress-Revised (OSBD-R) scale, and visual analog scale (VAS). Paired and unpaired t-tests were used to evaluate the effects of the interventions. The chi-square test was utilized to evaluate the relationship between demographic and dependent variables. Result Foot reflexology showed a significant difference (P < 0.05) in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and a highly significant difference (P < 0.0001) in anxiety and pain. The simple massage group showed a significant effect on temperature, anxiety, and pain. Both groups demonstrated a significant impact (P < 0.05) on systolic blood pressure and pain after the intervention. Conclusion  Most children were diagnosed with thalassemia during infancy, had a history of both parent's thalassemia minor, and were Rh+ve. Foot reflexology was more effective in reducing anxiety and pain than simple massage. Additionally, foot reflexology had a significant effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, while simple massage significantly affected temperature in children with thalassemia."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Loneliness, anxiety and depressive symptoms are common among older residents in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), which can negatively impact their quality of life and increase mortality rates. Addressing these psychological health issues is an important task for nursing staff. There is a need for easy and accessible interventions to improve older residents' negative emotions. Tactile massage (TM) is a form of touch therapy that induces oxytocin, which can help individuals feel relaxed, experience pleasure and reduce anxiety. TM can also provide a sense of security and care for individuals. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of TM in improving older residents' psychological health in LTCFs. DESIGN: In this study, we applied a two-arm randomised controlled trial research design. METHODS: We used convenience sampling to enrol 55 older residents in three long-term care facilities who were randomly assigned to an intervention group and a comparison group. The intervention group received TM by research assistants on both hands for 15 min per time, twice a week for 4 weeks and the comparison group received regular care. Data were collected before and after the intervention. Generalised estimating equations (GEEs) were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in loneliness, anxiety, depressive symptoms, happiness, ear temperature, heart rate or diastolic blood pressure between the two groups after the intervention. However, the intervention group had significant improvements in comfort (B = 0.86, p < 0.001), relaxation (B = 1.00, p < 0.001), respiratory rate (B = -0.16, p = 0.021) and systolic blood pressure (B = - 4.17, p = 0.002) compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: TM can help older residents who live in LTCFs feel relaxed and comfortable. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: TM can be easily implemented as it requires no tools. We recommend that nursing staff and healthcare professionals incorporate TM as part of their care routines. They also can encourage family members to perform TM on residents during their visits to enhance residents' comfort and relaxation. REPORTING METHOD: The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist was used for this paper. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05052138).",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of the addition of dynamic cervical electrical stimulation (electro-massage, ES) to manual therapy (MT), compared to MT by itself, in individuals with myofascial temporomandibular pain. METHODOLOGY: A total of 46 participants with bilateral myofascial temporomandibular pain for at least three months were distributed into two groups. Group 1 (n=21) received local MT consisting of soft tissue mobilization and release techniques over the neck and temporomandibular regions. Group 2 (n=25) received an ES procedure in the cervical region combined with the same intervention as group 1. All participants underwent a 2-week protocol. The primary outcomes were pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale), pressure pain threshold (PPT) at the masseter and upper trapezius muscles (algometer), and pain-free vertical mouth opening (manual gauge). The secondary outcome was active cervical range-of-movement. Measurements were taken at baseline, immediately after intervention, and at a 4-week follow-up. RESULTS: The ANOVA revealed significant changes over group*time, with better results for group 2 (large effect sizes) regarding pain intensity (p< 0.001; η2>0.14), pressure pain sensitivity and mouth opening (p<0.001; η2>0.14). Similar findings were observed for active cervical range-of-movement in all directions (p<0.001; η2>0.14), except rotation (p≥0.05). CONCLUSION: Electrical stimulation therapy over the cervical region combined with a MT protocol over the neck and temporomandibular joint shows better clinical benefits than MT by itself in subjects with myofascial temporomandibular pain.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common mental ailment. Moreover, it is one of the most incapacitating medical conditions. Although antidepressant medication has traditionally been the mainstay of treatment, adjunctive therapy may provide therapeutic advantages that reduce the severity of depression. METHODS: An experiment using randomization and control groups was undertaken. A total of forty-eight individuals diagnosed with severe depressive illness and undergoing antidepressant medication were selected and randomly assigned to either get traditional Thai massage (TTM) treatment, consisting of 90-minute sessions twice a week for eight weeks, or to be part of the control group, which continued with their regular daily activities. The main assessment tools used were the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), and the Khon Kaen University Depression Inventory 14 (KKU-DI-14). Secondary outcomes, such as blood pressure (BP) and quality of life measured by The EuroQol-5D-5L (EQ-5D-5L), were assessed both before and after the first therapy, as well as at the last session at the 8th week. RESULTS: The TTM group showed a statistically significant decrease in the HAM-D score within the eighth week of therapy compared to the control group (5.14 points, 95% confidence interval=2.92 to 7.37 points, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that combining TTM with antidepressant medication may effectively reduce depression scores and improve quality of life scores."

This study aimed to evaluate and compare the efficacy of a heated eye mask (HEM) and eyelid massage device EyePeace (EP) in alleviating signs and symptoms of evaporative dry eye. METHODS: Forty dry eye participants were recruited in a prospective, contralateral-eye trial study. After undergoing 10 min of HEM therapy, eyelid massage therapy was applied to one eye by the device. The efficiency was assessed at four time points: baseline (0 min), 5 min (5 min), 15 min (15 min), and 30 min (30 min). Non-invasive breakup time (NITBUT), redness score (RS Score), tear meniscus height (TMH), tear-film lipid layer (TFLL), endothelial cell count (ECC), meibomian gland expressibility (MGEx), meibomian gland quality (MGQ), conjunctivocorneal staining (CS), ocular surface temperature (OST), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), central corneal thickness (CCT) flat-axis keratometry value (K1), and steep-axis keratometry value (K2), were examined. RESULTS: Baseline clinical measurements did not have statistically significant differences between the groups (all p > 0.05). After 30 min, a comparison was made between the HEM group and EP + HEM group, revealing significant changes only in the primary outcomes, TFLL (2.18 ± 0.45 versus 2.40 ± 0.50; p < 0.05), and MGEx grades (0.68 ± 0.53 versus 0.98 ± 0.70; p < 0.05). Improvements in NITBUT and TMH were sustained until 5 min and 15 min after using EP + HEM. No significant changes were observed in RS Score, MGQ, OST, CFS, BCVA, IOP, ECC, K1, K2, and CCT (all p > 0.05) at all test time points. CONCLUSION: The application of a heated eye mask followed by a gentle massage using EyePeace on the eyelids can have a sustained improvement in the tear film lipid layer and meibomian gland expressivity score but not clinically significant, and does not pose any significant immediate impact on the cornea.Trial registration number: NCT06158997."
